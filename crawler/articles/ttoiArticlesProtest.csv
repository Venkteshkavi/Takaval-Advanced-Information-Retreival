It said, “Dear voters of Kanpur, Shri Ramlal, General Secretary (Org), Bharatiya Janata Party conveyed to me today that I should not contest the ensuing parliamentary election from Kanpur and elsewhere.”BJP leaders said the party took a “principled decision” that veterans should make way for younger leaders. The party has also denied tickets to other veterans likeShanta Kumar, B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra,Bijoya Chakravarty, who are over 80 years of age.Reacting to Joshi’s name being struck out, party MP Subramanian Swamy called it an “upsetting trend”. The MP, who has been increasingly out of sync with the BJP leadership, said the seniors were being told in the last minute that they are being dropped.In Bengaluru, the candidature of 28-year-old Tejasvi Surya as the Bangalore South contestant set off protests. The BJP state unit had suggested the name of late K Ananth Kumar’s wife Tejaswini Kumar. While Tejaswini said later in the day that she will support the party’s decision, there were protests by a faction of the party.Tejaswini was confident about fighting the poll and had been preparing for it and had started a door-to-door campaign. She said the party decision came as a shock to her and all of her supporters but maintained that it is very important to show that BJP is a party with a difference.In Patna, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was accosted by protestors raising slogans for BJP Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was a contender for the ticket. They showed black flags to Prasad at Patna airport. Party sources played down the episode, saying it was led by somebody who had been expelled from the party. They also claimed that Sinha has promised to work for the party’s victory.Tension in another constituency was defused when Union minister Giriraj Singh reluctantly agreed to the party’s decision to contest fromBegusaraiseat in Bihar. Singh, MP from Nawada Lok Sabha seat, told a news channel,“It is a question of my self-respect. I had wanted to contest from Begusarai in 2014 but was asked to do so from Nawada instead. I followed the party’s orders and emerged victorious.” He also shared the footage on his official twitter handle."

This will not be found anywhere else across the globe,"" he added.According to the association, the production and dispatch from the leases are never fixed and fluctuate according to the purchasing pattern of the steel industry.While buyers of iron ore are allowed to buy freely from outside Karnataka, sellers are not allowed to sell freely resulting in huge pile-up of inventory due to lack of sale, they added.Besides, there is also loss of contribution to the District Mineral Foundation (DMF) when ore from areas outside the state is bought by Karnataka buyers.In his appeal to the government, Rajakumar S said: ""We urge the government to ensure our survival by allowing free trade, giving preference to local iron ore over imports, and ensuring regular business for truckers and lakhs of other mining dependents.""After the protest rally, a delegation of 15 members met the authorities to hand over a memorandum of appeal."

However, he wasn’t present during the protest outside the party office.On Saturday, BJP’s high command announced its candidates for 10 of the 13 Lok Sabha constituencies it is contesting in Jharkhand. While the party retained most of the sitting MPs, it replaced Karia Munda, an eight-time MP from Khunti, by much younger partyman and former chief minister Arjun Munda. Out of total 14 Lok Sabha seats, BJP has given Giridih constituency to its ally Ajsu-P.Party sources reasoned age factor behind benching of Karia and said that an attempt is being made to replace leaders who are beyond 75 years. At the same time BJP leaders here added that none is aware about the fate of Ram Tahal’s candidature as the ball is in central leadership’s court now. BJP is likely to announce candidates for remaining three seats on March 25.Ram Tahal Choudhary (77) won the Ranchi parliamentary seat five times since 1991. He refused to accept the age bar. “What has age got to do with elections? I have been active since the last 50 years. Even at this age, I move around within and outside my constituency and attend Parliament regularly,” Choudhary told TOI over phone.“Ranchi is my home bastion and I can assure victory for BJP if it gives me a ticket. I am still sure of getting the ticket. The delay in announcing my name as a nominee for the Ranchi seat is baffling to me as well as my supporters,” he added.Asked if he will still fight even if the party doesn’t give him ticket, he said, “That’s a hypothetical question. I haven’t thought about it. I will take appropriate decision after consulting with my supporters.”"

Finally, in February, we paid the old fee for 2018-19. However, soon the students received a notice from the school telling them to pay the remaining amount.“The original primary school fee was about Rs 19,000 while the secondary fee was around Rs 22000, which we have paid. Why should we pay the fee hike which has not been approved by the EPTA yet? It is a government rule that the late fee can only be Re 1 per day after 365 days of non-payment. Why is the school asking for Rs 100 per week?” said a parent.Ms Madhuri Gokhale, principal of the school said, ""The fee increase has been done legally. We had applied for 15% hike to District Fee Regulation Committee because by rule the school can do so in two year's interval. The decision from DFRC is pending but till the decision comes, the rule says we can go ahead with the new fee. If the decision is against us, we will return the fee to respective parents. The Rs 100/ week late fee was approved in the ePTA meeting held last July. As far as switching affiliation to CBSE is considered, we have submitted the documents and we are expecting a committee to come and inspect the school. If parents have a problem, they can leave the school and join any other state board school of their choice.""Madhuri further said that the parents blocked her way and pushed her, post which police was called to the school. She has also filed a complaint (NC) with the police station against the parents for manhandling her."

Andhraites will be forced to retaliate in an appropriate manner and launch protests in Telangana,” Naidu said.During his tour of Rayachoti, Badvel, Palamaner, Srikalahasti and Tirupati in Kadapa and Chittoor districts, Naidu asked people to recall the ‘humiliation’ meted out to Andhra people in Telangana and Hyderabad under the TRS rule, after the ‘unilateral division’ of the state.“Despite contributing to the comprehensive development of AP centred around Hyderabad for almost 60 years, we were forced out of Hyderabad in 2014. We were forced to run the government from a bus fromAmaravati,” Naidu said.“But the humiliation meted out to me as well as our people gave me a reason to work even harder to not only protect the interests of the state but to lay a strong foundation for the future capital of Andhra Pradesh that would be better than Hyderabad or any other city in the country. Now after five years, when AP started building the state right from scratch and is progressing better than several well-off states in the country, KCR is unable to digest our progress and has conspired to stall our development with the support of YS Jaganmohan Reddy and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Naidu observed.''Telangana is creating hurdles for AP on all fronts right from sharing of waters, building Polavaram, paying our dues to the tune of Rs 1 lakh crore which is our legitimate share under different heads.

Finally, in February, we paid the old fee for 2018-19. However, soon the students received a notice from the school telling them to pay the remaining amount.“The original primary school fee was about Rs19,000 while the secondary fee was around Rs22000, which we have paid. Why should we pay the fee hike which has not been approved by the EPTA yet? It is a government rule that the late fee can only be Re 1 per day after 365 days of non-payment. Why is the school asking for Rs 100 per week?” said a parent."

They have already threatened to boycott the upcoming Lok Sabha elections if their demand is not met.Set to lose the main road against the construction work, the villagers have put up boards highlighting that they will vote only for the candidate who promises to solve their problem. Many people in villages like Sihala, Toderpur, Jhar Sahib, Kakrala and Behlolpur have shown resistance to the construction of the road (without the bridge) that will bypass Samrala town and increase the distance for them to reach Samrala and Machhiwara.Jasmair Singh, husband of the Sarpanch of Bondli village, said since they will lose the main road to their village which will increase the travel time between their village and the neighbouring towns, they have decided to protest the ongoing construction. He said, “We don’t have a problem with the construction of the bypass, but the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) should provide us with an overbridge so that we don’t have to travel a longer distance to reach Samrala and Machhiwara.”“Not only will the farmers, traders and students from our village will get affected by the construction of the bypass without a bridge, but it will also pose difficulty to the residents of many neighbouring villages. So, we all have come together and decided to protest till our demand for an overbridge is met,” said Singh.Villagers have said they are ready for the long struggle.“Tomorrow from 10am, we will start a protest march from our villages towards Samrala town and expecting over 400 villagers to join us,” said Neeraj Sihala, a social worker from Sihala village.“A few days ago, a team had come to the spot and they told the people that their demands are genuine, but haven’t given us anything in writing,” said Neeraj adding that students without bicycles will have to walk a long distance to reach their schools in Samrala, while many farmers will have to travel more than double the distance to reach their farms, Moreover, the cost of transportation of goods for traders will also increase if the authorities don’t provide a bridge over the road, he said.A villager said, “Normally, we have to travel a distance of about 1 km to reach Samrala, but after the construction of the bypass on the Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, it will increase the distance by three to four kilometres. Also, Machhiwara will get far by a few kilometres.”“We have heard that they are providing entry and exit points near Chehlan village, another such point 3-km north of our village at Dayalpura. The other irony is that the bypass will divide our village, with many villagers having houses on one side of the under-construction road and farmland on the other side.” He added this was a major issue in many villages of the area, and they will decide on voting after proper response from the authorities."

This move was opposed by the residents at a public hearing on January 16.“There is excessive pollution in our localities because of the plant. We want to wake the government up.

A number of them are incumbent MPs.BJP candidates from Meerut, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Amroha are in the firing line. Stating that they still “welcome the saffron party”, the residents and sympathizers are venting their ire in the open against the BJP candidates, and even threatened to use ‘NOTA’ option.Aggrieved residents panned the MPs’ performance in the last five years, calling it a “major failure”.“We welcome BJP in 2019, but will use ‘NOTA’, if Rajendra Agarwal is given a ticket” read banners in different parts of Meerut, such as Sisoli village and Sant Vihar Raj Nagar-Hari Nagar.Not just this, an embarrassing video of people protesting against Union minister Mahesh Sharma has gone viral on social media. Sharma is the current Union minister of State for Tourism and Culture (Independent charge).“We welcome BJP in 2019, but if Mahesh Sharma contests from the Gautam Buddh Nagar seat, let alone votes, we won’t even offer him a glass of water,” angry locals were seen shouting in the video which was apparently shot in Bulandshahr’s Mahip Jangeer village of Sikandrabad – which comes under the Gautam Buddh Nagar Lok Sabha constituency.Rajendra Agarwal is a two-time MP from Meerut. He has been serving the Lok Sabha constituency for 10 years. “Rajendra Agarwal ko vote nahi denge. Hum aisa umeedwaar nahi chahte jo kumbhkaran ki neend soye ho” (We will not vote for Rajendra Agarwal. We do not want a candidate who sleeps like Kumbhkaran), screamed a banner in Meerut’s Sant Vihar Rajnagar-Hari Nagar. Residents have also gone online against the choice of Meerut candidate.Disenchanted residents have also raised concerns against Bulandshahr MP Bhola Singh. They are demanding an immediate change of candidate, or else have openly threatened to “defeat the candidate”.BJP’s trouble doesn’t end here. In Amroha, effigy of MP Kanwar Singh Tanwar was burnt by BJP supporters outside the party office. They threatened that he will not be allowed to enter the villages.“He [Kanwar Singh Tanwar] is not a resident of Amroha. But, he has been given a ticket from Amroha for the second time. This is totally unacceptable. If he continues to be the BJP candidate, we will press ‘NOTA’ button on the election day,” said Deepak Kumar, a BJP member."

Interestingly, after seeing Bittu’s motorcade, the toll barrier staff tried to let it pass without charging but Bittu forcibly paid toll charges.Responding to his actions, district president of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Ranjit Singh Dhillon dubbed them as theatrics ahead of Lok Sabha polls. “Ludhiana MP has been misguiding people on the issue of toll and he is still trying to gain cheap publicity by indulging into such actions. He let thousands of vehicles pass through this toll plaza without paying any toll and now he is in favour of paying charges. He will be given the reply by Ludhiana residents whom he tried to fool by raking up the issue of toll and then running away from it without getting the toll charges waived off permanently,” he said.Bittu however claimed that he was not against paying toll to the company which was executing the national highway work. “The company is not liable to charge the toll if even after collecting crores of rupees it is not completing the pending works which is creating huge problem for residents. Asked why he paid the toll even after the toll authorities were giving him the exemption as an MP, he said, “As an MP I may be exempted from paying toll tax but I am entitled for this facility only when I am travelling in my official vehicle. With the election code of conduct in place, I am not entitled to use my official vehicle and I have been travelling in a private vehicle therefore I have to pay the toll as per rules.”"

Let us do our work,"" said Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia.The protests rekindled memories of major street demonstrations last August that lasted a week and erupted after two students were killed in a road accident.Tens of thousands took to the streets as the marches grew into a broad challenge against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been accused of waging a crackdown on dissent under a rule.Police responded then by firing tear gas and rounding up scores of students and prominent government critics who joined the marches, with some beaten.The heavy-handed response to a peaceful demonstration attracted international criticism.Hasina, whose chief rival is behind bars, was elected in December for a third consecutive term in a poll marred by rigging allegations and the mass detention of opposition figures.Bangladesh's transport sector is widely seen as corrupt, unregulated and dangerous. Thousands of buses and lorries ply the roads without certificates of roadworthiness.About 12,000 people die each year in accidents on Bangladesh's notorious roads, according to a monitoring group."

Condemning this, we have sought the removal of the SP from the case,” the student said.Following which, the district police have registered a case under the sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of Indian Penal Code against 167 students.

This is the second time in less than six months that auto drivers on this route—Jadavpur-Taratala—attacked passengers and one of the accused outside South City, Manoj, was a repeat offender. He had earlier been arrested and jailed for behaving rudely with passengers.It took cops—some of them senior officers—from one traffic guard and two police stations rescue the family from the clutches of the auto drivers, who even gheraoed the police officers. Some drivers even tried to block Anwar Shah Road. A case has been registered but no arrest has yet been made.The victims were residents of Bishalaksmitala near Budge Budge, police said. It was around 6.15pm that the family came out of the Anwar Shah Road mall and started looking for an auto to Behala Taratala. But one after the other, the auto drivers reportedly kept refusing them, one of them even claiming to have a flat tyre. All these autos were of the Jadavpur-Taratala route. “After multiple refusals, the woman tried to take the photo of the numberplate of an offending vehicle on her mobile. This apparently infuriated the drivers, who first threatened the family and then tried to snatch the phone away. They hit the man and pulled at his wife so hard they injured her. Two traffic sergeants from the Jadavpur traffic guard were the first to react, followed by two officers and a constable,” claimed the police.Even as the argument between the family and the auto drivers escalated, the five cops from the Jadavpur traffic guard arrived, one of them a woman officer, who reached a little later. The auto drivers, some 40 of them, seemed so brazen about their ways that they literally closed in on the cops who tried to protect the family. On seeing that they were outnumbered by the bully auto drivers, these cops dialled for help from the nearby Jadavpur and Charu Market police stations. Besides personnel from these police stations, a team arrived from theLake police stationand they together finally managed to take the family to the safety of the police station.The auto drivers did not merely stop at intimidating and attacking the family and gheraoing the cops. They even tried to park their vehicles on the road near South City, looking to block a significant section of the Tollygunge-bound flank apparently as a mark of protest, but the cops thwarted their attempt.“A case has been registered at the Lake police station under sections 354 (molestation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed) of the IPC. No one has been arrested yet. There is no CCTV camera covering the exact spot where the incident took place, but we are identifying all the accused and they will be arrested soon,” said an investigating officer. The auto drivers have also lodged a complaint, claiming it was the husband who attacked them first.The police pointed out that drivers Manoj, Kalu and Mohd Idris were among those involved in the fracas. “Manoj has had a case lodged against him by cops from the Jadavpur traffic guard for misbehaving with passengers. He was even sent to jail for it. We suspect it was him and the fellow drivers who instigated the fight,” said an investigating officer.The family later alleged that cops from the Lake police station arrived almost 30 minutes later, allowing the auto drivers to pile up pressure. “Even after there was a commotion on the road, the reaction time from the cops left a lot to be desired,” claimed the woman."

However, college principal Roy Sam Daniel did not approve the syndicate order. This created a tense situation and police team, led by DSP R Sreekumar, arrived at the college.According to college authorities, the exams were delayed by 15 minutes.However, SFI leaders said there was no issue on the campus which affected the conduct of the examinations. The delay was because students had to wait to take the question paper along with them after the exam. They also said that they had approached the college authorities as the two students had received a favourable order from the syndicate.Meanwhile, the principal said that there were several complaints, including sexual harassment, against the suspended students. Both of them were suspended in December last year for ragging. Since the two students belonged to the SFI union, the syndicate allowed them to write the exam, Daniel said.Now, the decision in this regard will be taken by the college governing council, the principal added. tnn"

In any scenario, the number of seats cannot be zero in reserved category and we have demanded to stop the recruitment process until the revision is made,” said Munda, adding that the delegation also handed a memorandum to Singh demanding the same.Other demands included minimum eligibility criteria which is set as BSc Nursing (four-year course) or BSc (Post certificate) or BSc Nursing (Post — basic) should be changed and General Nurse Midwifery (GNM) should be included in the criteria for this post.Aadivasi Chatra Sangh president Sushil Oraon said: “The reservation policy provides us 26% reservation in all state government jobs and the current recruitment advertisement is in violation of that policy. The GNMs future is also at stake after the change in eligibility criteria.” Singh assured the team that a committee will be formed to examine the recruitment process. “The reservation policy will not be violated at any costs. I have listened to the grievances and have assured them that a committee will be formed and the whole process will be relooked. We will rectify whatever is needed,” he said.Another source said the absence of ST seats is a result of conversion of temporary staff nurses into regular ones in 2014. “The majority of nurses who were absorbed as regular staff then were from reserved category and the current number of such nurses are more than approved positions. That is why ST quota in the current advertisement stands at zero,” said a staff nurse at Rims."

The leaders, who interacted with the media, announced that they would hold a protest in front ofKR Hospitalto urge the government to reverse the hike in prices, which came into effect on March 1.“The hike in user fees in government hospitals, including at KR Hospital will inconvenience poor patients. The government should roll it back immediately,” said Chamaraja MLA Nagendra.Krishnaraja MLA Ramadas also lashed out at the state government for its flawed implementation of theAyushman Bharatscheme. “Unlike other states in the country, Karnataka adopted a different tack to provide benefits of the central scheme to citizens. In other states, beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat can avail of its benefits in all hospitals, but in Karnataka, this facility is restricted only to empanelled hospitals. As a result, patients are put to a lot of hardship,” Ramadas said.The Krishnaraja MLA and former minister said that, in Karnataka, the rules stipulated that a patient first visit a government hospital, and only if the state-run facility could not offer the treatment necessary, could he or she be referred to a private institution. Citing an example of a youngster who suffered a fracture, Ramadas said, “He was asked to receive treatment at both government and private institutions owing to which he suffered multiple complications. This is ridiculous.”Ramadas also charged chief minister HD Kumaraswamy with misleading the public by giving wrong figures on the number of below poverty line beneficiaries of health schemes in Karnataka. “The Karnataka government has pegged the number of BPL card holders at 52 lakh, whereas the actual figure is 1.2 crore,” he said.The BJP leaders said that they would launch the protest at 10am on Tuesday. The other demand the BJP activists had was the issuance of health cards to all beneficiaries."

For a while Aksakoglu's family hoped he would soon be released, but then on March 4, a 657-page indictment was released saying they had masterminded an attempt to overthrow Erdogan's government.""I say to her, 'I promise I and your daddy's friends will get him out. Don't worry. This misunderstanding will end.' But a part of me is really scared,"" Unzile said.Supporters of the detainees say the indictment contains no evidence and many bizarre accusations, and marks a new low for a country where 77,000 people already been jailed in a crackdown following a failed military coup in 2016.The European Union said that by seeking life sentences, prosecutors were creating a climate of fear in Turkey, while the U.S. State Department has said Washington is gravely concerned.The arrests are the latest step in a crackdown which Turkey says is a necessary response to security threats that the country faces and which has involved widespread purges in the armed forces, ministries and state organisations.FLOWERS AND GASMASKSIn the summer of 2013, hundreds of thousands marched in Istanbul and across Turkey to protest against plans to build replica Ottoman barracks on Gezi Park by Istanbul'sTaksim Square, chanting ""everywhere is Taksim, everywhere is resistance"".Eight young protesters and a police officer were killed in the unrest and 5,000 injured. The indictment, formally accepted by an Istanbul court on March 4, says hundreds of properties were damaged in the protests.It also includes assertions that rights groups have dismissed as fanciful conspiracies.It says the protests were organised by local extensions of ""forces which control global capital"", singling out billionaire philanthropist George Soros. Erdogan has vilified Soros as ""the famous Hungarian Jew ... who assigns people to divide nations"".The indictment says the ""Gezi Uprising"" was fuelled by Osman Kavala, a well-known civil society leader and businessman who has been in jail since October 2017.A picture from Kavala's phone taken from an academic book showing how different types of bees are distributed across the Middle East was described in the indictment as showing Turkey's borders violated and redrawn.It said the fact that defendants discussed bringing milk, juice and pastries to Gezi, as well as gasmasks to counter the effects of tear gas, showed they were financing the protests.The Taksim Solidarity group, which includes some of the 16 defendants, poured scorn on the indictment, saying it portrayed the handing out of flowers to police and the provision of sandwiches to protesters as signs of guilt.The demonstrations, the indictment says, were inspired by the worldwide ""Occupy"" protests and Arab uprisings starting in 2011 and a book by Boston-based academic Gene Sharp called 'From Dictatorship to Democracy'.The indictment cites Gezi protest acts that matched Sharp's non-violent protest methods, such as Roger Waters' ""The Wall"" concert in Istanbul in August 2013 when photos of people killed in the protests were displayed on a huge stage backdrop.Amnesty InternationalTurkey representative Andrew Gardner described the case as ""an attempt to rewrite history"" and said the request for life sentences without parole represented a ""massive escalation"" in Turkey's crackdown on civil society.""What we are facing is an existential crisis for independent civil society in Turkey,"" he said. ""It is a blatant attempt to scare and pursue critics on completely trumped-up, fanciful conspiracy theories.""Erdogan equates the Gezi protesters with Kurdish militants and those accused of carrying out a failed coup in 2016. In campaigning for March 31 local elections he has often accused opposition parties of being allied with militants.The protests began to prevent the redevelopment of a park in a city with limited green space, but Erdogan dismissed the idea of environmental motivation, saying: ""Those who planned and financed the Gezi events, tried to overthrow the government using 12 trees as an excuse are giving account to the judiciary.""No one in Turkey gets away with crimes they committed any more,"" the president said in a speech last week.""NO EVIDENCE""Aksakoglu, who works for a Dutch foundation which supports young children's development, was interrogated for 11 hours after he was detained in November. The specific charges against him say he was involved in organising meetings to prepare civil disobedience.When first jailed he angrily paced around his cell in prison west of Istanbul, wondering why he had been charged, his wife Unzile said. She said his anger flared up again after reading the indictment.Unzile said her husband is a social scientist rather than an activist and never met Kavala. The indictment said he had been in contact with someone who had.Kavala himself is accused of spreading protests through his organisation Anadolu Kultur, which promotes culture and rights. Osman Kavala's lawyer Ilkan Koyuncu said it was hard to see what his client was actually accused of, and the contents of the indictment offered no evidence to support the charges.""You hold these people responsible for all the windows that were broken in June 2013... but provide no evidence. This is not something that can be done legally,"" he said.Then-prime minister Erdogan and his cabinet of the time are all plaintiffs in the case and the indictment names 746 people as injured parties in the nationwide protests, holding the defendants responsible for all injuries and damage to property, such as smashed windows.Istanbul Bilgi Universitylaw professor Yaman Akdeniz said the indictment lacked legal detail and reasoning, with only 1-1/2 pages of legal issues in the 657-page document.""Basically, it is shambolic and if it was written by one of my law students, he or she would get a clear F mark,"" he said.Aksakoglu's lawyer Asli Kazan said the indictment relied on wiretaps from the second half of 2013, after theGezi protests.She said that investigation was originally launched by prosecutor Muammer Akkas, himself now a fugitive accused of membership of what Ankara terms a terrorist group led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Ankara blames for the failed 2016 coup.His long-shelved investigation was taken up again around 2016, when the current case was opened, the lawyer said.Addressing this issue, the prosecutor said in the indictment that though suspects claimed the investigation was directed by ""armed terrorist organisation militants"", their influence on the case file had been removed by a re-evaluation of all the evidence and wiretaps after 2016."

Nationwide, protesters were estimated at 32,300, compared with 28,600 last week.ULTRA VIOLENTInterior Minister Christophe Castaner said that although the protest was relatively small, there had been more than 1,500 ""ultra violent"" people out looking for trouble.""They decided, perhaps as a swansong, to come attack - and I use their words - Paris,"" Castaner said, adding that more than 1,400 police officers were mobilised.A separate, peaceful march against climate change through central Paris drew as many 36,000 people, police estimated. Some 145,000 people marched nationwide.Yellow vest protesters had promised to draw bigger numbers to mark the fourth month since the movement erupted in mid November over since-scrapped fuel tax hikes and the cost of living.Named after the high-visibility vests French drivers have to keep in their cars and worn by protesters, the revolt swelled into a broader movement against Macron, his reforms and elitism.However, the weekly demonstrations, held every Saturday in Paris and other cities, have been generally getting smaller since December, when Paris saw some of the worst vandalism and looting in decades.After the spike in violence, Macron offered a package of concessions worth more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) aimed at boosting the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners.His government ordered police to crack down on the protests in January, leading to complaints of police brutality.The 41-year-old former investment banker also launched a series of national debates aimed at determining what policies people want the government to focus on. Saturday's protests coincided with the end of the debates."

With their aprons and uniforms, they started polishing shoes of passersby. Those not polishing shoes raised slogans against the government.Prasad Kapane, a third year student of veterinary degree course, told TOI that graduates and registered vets will be jobless and have to start shoe polish jobs if the government continues with the decision.“We are raising our voice since the state government issued this order on March 8. If diploma holders are getting promoted as officers, it will have devastating effects on livestock and farmers,” he said.Dr Tejas Wankhade, president of state-level union of veterinary students, said the agitation will continue until the state government rolls back the decision.“We had gone on a strike for two days earlier this week. MAFSU vice-chancellor assured us that the issue will be raised at the ministry level. So, the strike has been called off. But protests will continue. Today’s shoe polish agitation was a part of the protest,” he said.Wankhede said the students have already informed city police about their intentions to resort to road protests from next week.Sources at the government animal husbandry department said that revoking the already issued promotion orders will not happen. After the elections, the government may consider not to announce more such promotions, but the present orders will continue.“These veterinary supervisors are very experienced. They have been promoted on the basis of their skills and not on the basis of mere qualification,” the source said."

And here it so happens that the company building the plant is 99%-owned by Chinese nationals.""She said the construction boom of often illegal hotels infuriates locals because they themselves cannot get permission to build anything on protected shore.Locals also don't earn money from Chinese tourists who are serviced by Chinese firms on Baikal, she said.""There has been a cumulative effect"" which resulted in the anti-plant backlash, Pavlova added. ""People are tired of government inaction.""Denis Bukalov, a campaigner against the project based in Irkutsk, however said ""it's not not important that it's the Chinese"".Construction had ""ruined"" the shoreline in Kultuk after the ""illegal"" portioning off of land, according to the campaigner.He said the plant set a dangerous precedent.""You can see on the map of registered land ownership that seven parcels of land are set aside for bottling water"" nearby, he said.""They will turn Baikal into a swamp,"" he told AFP.Ecologists point out the project has not accounted for its location on wetlands important for birds.The area is a key feeding ground during migration seasons, with 130 different bird species recorded there.Some of those have protected status, said biologist Igor Fefelov of Russian Bird Conservation Union.This ""was not even mentioned"" in the plant's environmental assessment, he said.Irkutsk region governor Sergei Levchenko, who backed the plant in 2017, has flipped 180 degrees in the face of growing protest.""The site is environmentally protected land on all sides,"" he said this week. ""I think this is insurmountable. I don't see the potential for bottling water there.""Environmentalist Kolotov said the project would likely turn off others from efforts to experiment with green businesses on the lake.""It's as if the project was designed especially to discredit the idea of bottling Baikal water,"" he said."
Hundreds of NCR school students join global protest to halt ‘climate breakdown’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/hundreds-of-ncr-school-students-join-global-protest-to-halt-climate-breakdown/articleshow/68434003.cms,"Gurgaon news, Gurgaon latest news, Gurgaon news live, Gurgaon news today, Today news Gurgaon, Wazirabad,students,Posters,pollution,performances,Government,climate,central park",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//static.toiimg.com/photo/34824568.cms,"GURUGRAM/NEW DELHI: Shivi Anand (15) wants you to save jamun, jackfruit and mango seeds this summer. Wash, pack and keep them in your car, and whenever you spot a patch of barren land while travelling, throw these seeds and watch the future grow.“If every person here did this, we could make Gurugram green again, beautiful again, clean again,” said the young environmentalist from Pathways School, addressing a group of students, parents and fellow green activists.On Friday, over 600 students bunked school to gather atWazirabadbundh – location of a group of life-size art installations created from waste – to take part in the Global School Strike forClimateChange. As the father of one of the participating students asked, “What will the students do sitting in school when there is no clean air outside?”Recently, data compiled in the IQAir AirVisual 2018 World Air Quality Report prepared in collaboration with Greenpeace Southeast Asia revealed that five out of the top 10 most-polluted cities in the world are in Delhi-NCR with Gurugram being at the number 1 spot.The students took inspiration from Swedish student and political activist Greta Thunberg who had in August 2018 called for a school strike. Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize this year.The children made banners out of waste material, on which were highlighted the pressing issues of the day – air pollution, climate change, a proposed road that would have cut through the Aravali Biodiversity Park. There was also rapping, danceperformancesand a slogan march. Shivi admitted to feeling extremely “charged”, knowing that many people were voicing their concern for the environment.Campaign group Fridays For Future, which is tracking these protests across the world in 112 countries and 1,787 locations, reports that 186 strikes were planned in Germany, 126 in the US and 123 in Italy. The rallies covered all inhabited continents, and featured events in Brazil, Iran, Japan, India, Ukraine and Russia among other countries. And with Gurugram now officially the world’s most polluted city, students from Pathways, Heritage, Shri Ram and Excelsior American schools turned out in big numbers, along with their parents.One of these peaceful protesters was Arya Dhar Gupta (13). Terming pollution as ‘millennial cancer’, Arya explained that the demonstration was totally aggression and intimidation- free. “We wanted to make a point on how government is pro-development but it should not ignore the environment. Even the United Nations report says India is the world’s most polluted country. All of us signed our hand-prints as a signature to mark the protest,” said this British School student.In Delhi, too, about a hundred students from over 15 schools came out to participate in the strike. AtCentral Parkin Connaught Place, they took turns to speak about the harmful effects of pollution and global warming. They also asked the governments to care for their future.“Instead of talking about how other countries are better, we should start to create a better India. There is plastic everywhere and even the cows eat those,” said a student.Asees Kandhari (15), who called herself a ‘climate rebel’, said, “This is not climate change, this is climate breakdown. We will have to face the worst. You adults have done the damage and need to radically change your ways. We can’t afford to rest until you have done that.”Madhur, a participant at the event, spoke to the children about how she, a pregnant woman, is worried about her future in NCR. “There’s dust and pollution everywhere. How do I protect my baby when he can’t get healthy air in the city? I request politicians to include pollution as an election issue,” she said. Many students also requested politicians to bring in new legislation to improve the environment and air quality. “Companies care only for sales and profit. They are generating a Mount Everest of waste daily. Government has to enforce end producer responsibility and make them responsible for their waste,” said Aditya Mukherji, a student.Many people who came to visit Central Park were impressed by the enthusiasm of the children. Ashish who was at Connaught Place with his friends said that “this is a good step by students, our environment is in danger”."

It proves he too is fully supportive of Ashu, who is known for misbehaving,” said Dhillon.Dhillon also said if no action was taken on the complaint filed by SAD, then the party would hit the roads and sit on protest against both the cabinet ministers."

So, now it’s our responsibility to save our planet,” says a Class 7 student, Nishitha Kongati.Every student who came to protest stood there with conviction, urging the politicians to put the environment before the country’s economy. They were accompanied by their teachers as well as city-based environmental activists. “Why have hundreds of students gathered here today? It’s because the adults have failed. Democracy is a team game, not a spectator sport. As all the adults have been mere spectators, now it’s upon the students to be team players. With ground water levels depleting at an alarming rate, majority of Hyderabadis are surviving on water tankers. We want politicians to make the environment their primary agenda,” shares Kajal Maheswari, a city-based environmental activist.Pointing out that the climate change situation is rapidly worsening, activists state that it’s imperative for politicians to step in before it’s too late. “We are concerned about our lung spaces, including the KBR Park, Mrugavani National Park in Chilkur, Pranahitha Wildlife Sanctuary in Karimnagar and Bison polo grounds, among others. We don’t want a situation where students attend class wearing oxygen masks. We don’t want students to end up in hospitals instead of schools. That’s why they have skipped school today to protest for a better future,” says Arpit Sharma, an activist with a city-based NGO.Amid chants of ‘Save the planet, save the future’, students emphasised that taking small steps could help bringing a significant change in the movement towards a greener planet. “Children can’t fight climate change alone. The adults will have to step in. We must take small steps like taking a pledge to not use polythene bags. The change must start from within and everybody should come together to create more awareness about climate change,” explains Manish Bugalia, a student of Class 7.Joining hands with school children across the world, city students urged politicians to help them create a better future. They also called for an open house discussion with TRS working president KT Rama Rao on Urban Planning. The students made several suggestions that included the need to curb vehicular pollution and building more bicycle paths, pedestrian walkways and public spaces."

But given that films, especially political satires, have not had it easy with the smallest of criticisms inviting protests from political outfits and leaders, it is interesting to understand what makes filmmakers dabble with controversial topics and can they really exercise their freedom of expression.Making a political film is a risk that filmmakers take. Threats of a boycott, trolling on social media and, in case the film is not released, loss of producer’s money and waste of effort, are the most commonly faced issues. Not too long ago, the Tamil Nadu government took objection to scenes that dealt with freebie culture in A R Murugadoss’s ‘Sarkar’. After a few forced cuts and a promise from the director that he will not criticize government policy’s in future, the film was released.But for some creative minds, opposition does not deter them. From ‘NOTA’ to ‘LKG’, there has been no dearth of films that have tried to hold a mirror to the political state of affairs. Adding to this list are Selvaraghavan’s ‘NGK’, Venkat Prabhu’s ‘Maanaadu’, which have apoliticsat the core of their story.Three weeks ago, LKG (Lalgudi Karuppiah Gandhi) created waves for being openly critical about national and state politics. Speaking to TOI, R J Balaji, who played the protagonist says, ""The movie, a political satire, shows all that has been happening from the 1960s. A lesson of sorts for youngsters who are least concerned about politics.""The use of the 1954 song ""Ethanai Kalam Dhaan Ematruvaar Indha Naatiley…"" (How long will they cheat us in this country) from the MGR-starrer ‘Malai Kallan’, showed how the issues that people face have not changed. ""The movie spares none. It is a political satire and whatever has been projected in the movie portrays transparency and true incidents. By bringing in former politicians Nanjil Sampath and J K Rithesh I wanted to make the script as real as possible,"" says Balaji, who has largely garnered appreciation among the few threats and negative comments that branded him a DMK stooge.From ‘Parasakthi’ to ‘Palaivana Rojakal’ and ‘Amaidhi Padai’, films have been a vehicle of propaganda, political awareness and introspection. The best political films are those that leave the audience with an insight, says producer and founder-dean of BOFTA G Dhananjayan. ""There is a difference between political satire with an intention to isolate and mock one party and the other is when it is an objective take on the system. In case of ‘LKG’, it is done in a comical way by criticizing one and all, doe intelligently,"" he says.Except for the master political satirist Cho Ramaswamy, whose film ‘Muhammad Bin Tughlaq’ ridiculed the leaders of both the DMK and the Congress at the Centre and political parties in general, there have hardly been any direct parodies of the government.Balaji feels ‘LKG’ escaped the scrutiny because he is not in the big league. When Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan or Vijay utter a statement, it is has a bigger affect. But having spoken about beef ban, cow vigilantes and Sellur Raja’s thermocol attempt in ‘LKG’, the actor believes there is more freedom now when compared to five years ago. He praises the organic way in which the Central Board of Film Certification reviewed the film.On his entry into films, Nanjil Sampath, says agreeing to be a part of a political satire has been the best decision for him.

They have been demanding an amendment to rules by the defense ministry, which would help residents get clearance for construction and maintenance of land and houses which are in close proximity to Pangodemilitary camp.After several attempts, the Nanma Koottayma is conducting dharna in front of AG’s office at 4.30pm on Friday.A defense circular dated May 18, 2011 had put forth restrictions on any form of construction within 100 metres of a military establishment. A no-objection certificate (NOC) has to be secured from camp authorities before taking up any construction works in the prescribed limits. As the circular caused widespread upheaval across the nation from large numbers of people who were affected by the issue, an amendment was introduced on October 21, 2016 which decreased the restrictions to a certain extent. For around 149 military camps the prescribed distance was shortened to 50 metres and for another 193 stations it was shortened to 10 metres. Unfortunately, apart from Kannur, no other camps in Kerala including Pangode made it to the amended list which has put the residents in dire distress.On 15 March, 2018, the collective forwarded the first representation to Shashi Tharoor MP demanding Pangode to be included in the amended list. The defense ministry in its response informed that such a relaxation will not be applicable for Pangode.Tharoor will inaugurate the dharna on Friday.General convener of Nanma Koottayma S Prasannakumar, said that they only wanted permission to build and maintain buildings on their own land. “Apart from Jammu and Kashmir, most of the military camps across the nation made it to the amended list apart from those in our state. Development and maintenance works have almost come to a standstill ever since the restrictions were imposed,” he said."

Despite several students dying in bike accidents over the years, students have failed to adhere to safety norms.When contacted, in-charge dean, Prof RK Mandloi said MANIT has never encouraged students to not to follow traffic rules. “I am transport expert. MANIT always ensured that students must follow traffic rules. We even tried to make the campus free of vehicles in the past, but due to pressure from students and their families, it could not be implemented,” Mandloi told TOI.About Tuesday’s incident, he said, “I have no idea about it. A meeting will be called to discuss the entire issue that took place.” Cops have also launched a probe about the issue.Though several times in the past, the MANIT management had made the campus a bikefree zone and even tried to impose a total ban on hostellers using vehicles inside the campus, the rules were never implemented. Former MANIT director,Appu Kuttan(2011-2016), tried to keep the campus a bikefree zone several times, but in vain. A senior faculty, who did not wish to be named, said the rule was implemented, but revoked within a few days.It was revoked as students continued to defy the no-bike policy with vehicles freely moving around the campus. Students had claimed that they would comply with the rule if the authorities first provided them properfacilitieslike laboratories. “It was decided in 2014 that two-wheelers and four-wheelers were not allowed to enter the campus. Only teachers living on the campus were allowed to keep vehicles and that also after proper permission from MANIT to use them only when they were going outside the campus. But even that decision could not be implemented,” sources said.Currently, over 5,000 students are studying in the institute. According to authorities, almost 60% students ride motorbikes on the campus."

Over the last eight years, the three-day cultural fiesta has been organised at theamphitheatrein the AravalliBiodiversityPark. This year, however, the festival may see a change in venue. Last week, a group of environmentalists met officials from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to express their objection to the park hosting Gurgaon Utsav. Their argument was that since the Aravalli Biodiversity Park is a deemed forest, there should be no concretisation and no musical nights there. Officials of MCG – which supports the festival – say they are now looking at alternative venues for the festival. This also means that the festival might be postponed from its currently scheduled dates of March 15-17.
Gurgaon Utsav is organised by a not-for-profit organisation called the Art and Literature Society, with the MCG providing administrative support. This year’s edition is slated to bring to the Millennium City artists likeHans Raj Hans, Hari and Sukhmani, Parvathy Baul, and Mita Vashisht. Last week, environmentalists from Gurgaon-based NGO Haryali Welfare Society met MCG Commissioner Yashpal Yadav, requesting him to intervene and shift the utsav out of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park.Gurgaon Utsav has been held annually at the amphitheatre in the Biodiversity ParkVivek Kamboj, founder and director of the NGO, tells us, “We are not against music and cultural celebrations but there are other places in Gurgaon where this festival can be held. If the construction of a highway causes disturbance to the flora and fauna in the Biodiversity Park, a music event with speakers and amplifiers does so too. The strong floodlights, loud noises, and so much of human activity jeopardises the sensitive ecosystem of the Biodiversity Park and its wildlife. Also, the court has called the biodiversity park a deemed forest, which means any concretisation and such musical activity here is ethically wrong.”MCG Commissioner Yashpal Yadav referred the matter to relevant officials in the civic body. It was this second meeting that bore fruit for the environmentalists. MCG Joint Commissioner Hari Om Attri, who met the environmentalists, says, “We have taken note of the objections raised by some citizens and activists about Gurgaon Utsav, and on the face of it, the objections seem genuine and legitimate. We are discussing and also speaking to the forest and wildlife departments, who are trying to ascertain the facts. If found true, we will shift the event out of the Biodiversity Park and look for an alternative venue.”Organisers of the Gurgaon Utsav remain tight-lipped about the development, saying that the MCG will decide the fest’s future and venue and they shall abide by the decision.Activists have said that the amphitheatre in the Biodiversity Park is a violation of the Forest Conservation Act 1972 and Wildlife Protection Act 1980 that prohibit any non-forest activities thereIn any case, even if the fest takes place at the Biodiversity Park this year, it might be the last time it is staged there. The activists have said that the amphitheatre in the Biodiversity Park itself is a violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1972 and Wildlife Protection Act, 1980 that prohibit any non-forest activities there. Sources from the MCG say senior officials are contemplating stopping all musical activities there. “Both the forest department and wildlife department are preparing reports based on the allegations and we feel it might be best that in the future, the amphitheatre isn’t used for events like musical nights that can disturb the animal population there,” says an MCG official who did not wish to be named.Interestingly, the amphitheatre was built in the Biodiversity Park after consultation with environmentalists and local residents. The Biodiversity Park used to be a stone quarry and was restored to its current status as the ‘green lung of Gurgaon’ by IAmGurgaon, a citizen’s collective, almost a decade ago. It was during this restoration in 2010 that the MCG built the amphitheatre in after consulting with IAmGurgaon. Latika Thukral, founder, IAmGurgaon, tells us, “When the amphitheatre was conceived, it was done close to the edge of the park, as close to the habitation as possible, so that it didn’t disturb the ecosystem. The aim was never to be disruptive or harm the wildlife or ecosystem of the park in any way. We have and will always have the best interests of Gurgaon and the Biodiversity Park in our minds.”"

The owners of the call centres are being called to the police station and intimidated. They are being asked to stop working for AAP. Will Amit Shah fight election like this?” Kejriwal tweeted while daring the police to arrest him and AAP leaders.Singh wrote to the election commission demanding action against the cops involved.Raghav Chadha, the AAP candidate for the South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, alleged that the police were working on the directions of BJP. “If they consider getting voters’ names reinstated is a crime, they must arrest us. If BJP thinks they can intimidate and threaten those who work with us and shut down our awareness campaign, they are mistaken and we will not let it happen,” Chadha said.Singh claimed that “BJP is afraid of AAP before the elections and is resorting to such tactics to threaten us”.AAP has alleged that the names of 30 lakh voters have been deleted by the election commission in a conspiracy hatched by BJP. Rejecting the allegations as baseless, the commission has said around 10 lakh new voters have been added since 2014.In the past few months, calls had been made to a large number of voters in Delhi about deleted names. However, after many voters found their name in the electoral roll, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari accused AAP of lying to citizens. A BJP delegation also met the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Delhi to complain about the phone calls. Later, the CEO askedDelhi Policeto take necessary action against the misleading phone calls."

It was their demand, but if they collectively decide that they do not want to be a part of this tournament, what can we do,” a senior AIFF official asked.Beyond the tough talk, the AIFF has already started reaching out to the agitating clubs. For the first time, the AIFF acknowledged receipt of the Feb 18 letter from the clubs and said AIFF president Praful Patel has been unable to meet since he has been travelling.AIFF has held informal talks with some club owners too and suggested a meeting with Patel will happen soon. The problem is that the Super Cup qualifiers kick off on Friday, and if there is no clarity before the managers meeting on Thursday, some of them could be left in the lurch.Within the clubs too, questions are being asked.East Bengal, for example, sent out a press release that they have joined the seven clubs in boycotting the Super Cup, but another statement from the club — signed by general secretary Kalyan Majumdar — said they have the “tradition and legacy to not step back from participating keeping in view of the fact discrepancies if any, can be sorted out by discussion and deliberations.”The mixed steps taken by the influential clubs have kept others on their guard.

The move will allow paramedics to do surgeries, castrations, and give vaccinations and anaesthesia, which only doctors are qualified to do.The government plans to fill 125 posts of veterinarians by recruiting ‘livestock supervisors’, said Dr Atul Patil. Livestock supervisors, on par with ward boys in hospitals for human beings, assist doctors. “Now, the government is putting ward boys in place of doctors,” said Dr Patil. To facilitate promotion of livestock supervisors, the government has designated them as assistant livestock development officers (B), said a veterinarian.A final year student said, “It’s illogical to compare knowledge and skills acquired by a degree-holding vet during eight years to that of a diploma holder who studied for two years. It is complete injustice to the health of animals that will suffer in case of mishaps. The animals which these officers will treat mainly belong to farmers. Loss of such livestock due to incompetent knowledge is not something which can be borne by a farmer seeing their financial condition in our country.”Veterinary students at the undergraduate, postgraduate and doctorate levels, have stayed away from lectures and clinical work to protest against this. Maharashtra Veterinary Students’ Association has written to the government to roll back its decision. The letter stated, “This move comes at a time when the world is trying to stop spread of diseases from animals to humans… A large number of veterinary graduates are available in Maharashtra and it is wrong to let less qualified persons do their job…”A professor of veterinary medicine, practising for almost three decades, said the government’s move was “just not right”. “Veterinary Council Of India Act states that only veterinary graduates can treat and diagnose… The government’s move will put animal health at risk,” the doctor said.Despite the strike, the students have deputed one or two doctors to attend to hospital duty so that “ailing animals do not suffer”.Vetsacross the state, mainly in government establishments, are supporting the students’ strike. “When there is no shortage of vets, why should the government pass a resolution to promote under-qualified diploma holders,” said a vetsurgeon."

The farm organisation demanded that the paddy transplanting should be allowed from June 1.Aiming at saving the depleting underground water table, the state government last year had fixed the date for paddy transplantation from June 20. Earlier it was June 10.The BKU (Ekta Dakonda) state president Buta Singh Burjgill and general secretary Jagmohan Singh said that the moisture content increased in the paddy transplanted from June 20 as when it matures and is ready for harvesting winter sets in, which increases the moisture content. The farmers thus have to face a lot of hardship as the procurement agencies do not accept the crop with more moisture content more than the permissible limit of 17%.Also when transplantation is allowed from June 20, all farmers go in for sowing en masse, which increases the load on electricity grids and many a time these break down. They said presently the varieties which are produced take more than 120 days in maturing and late sowing of these varieties is not in favour of anyone as the damage causes loss even to the state economy.Meanwhile, activists of the farm organisation continued with their protests to get back cheques from banks on day two. They took out a protest march here on Wednesday."

The police department, which did not take any action initially, acted only after political outfits raised the issue. So, it got politicised.”TheDMK leadercondemned the police for revealing the names of the victims. “Is is an offence to reveal the identity of victims of rape and sexual assault. Police delayed the arrest of the accused and leaked the names of the victims to stop more women from lodging complaints against the perpetrators. The accused had been sexually abusing women from 2012. So, police should reinvestigate cases of female suicides reported from Pollachi and surrounding areas from 2012,” she said.The rural police arrested Kanimozhi and 650 cadres of DMK, CPI, CPM, Congress, AAP, TMMK, KDMK, Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam and All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) for conducting the protest without permission. They were later let off.Cadres of the Students Federation of India (SFI) from the Government Arts College and Government Law College also staged protests in the city demanding action against the accused.More than 30 students from the arts college boycotted classes and staged a protest in front of the college. They raised slogans and demanded the arrest of all the accused. As many as 56 SFI functionaries staged a protest near the district collectorate on Tuesday afternoon. The city police arrested 56 students and kept them in a marriage hall.As many as 25 students from the Government Law College boycotted classes and staged protest in front of the college.Meanwhile, speaking to reporters, BJP national general secretary Muralidhar Rao said the issue will not undermine the poll prospects of the NDA alliance in the state. “AIADMK is a big party and the governing party. Somewhere, something has happened, which is not desirable and not good. As a political party, they have taken action,” he said.Rao, however, added that if the AIADMK leadership is seen as insensitive or not justice-oriented, there would be a problem. “But I believe that AIADMK is conscious about the issue and will take action.”In a petition to deputy commissioner of police L Balaji Saravanan on Tuesday, AIADMK district IT wing secretary R Sasikumar said that DMK was trying to tarnish the images of AIADMK over the issue. “They also spread rumours against minister SP Velumani and deputy speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman. Stringent action should be taken against DMK youth wing deputy organisers Ranjithkumar and S Dhandayuthapani from Sulur for spreading rumours against the ministers,” the petition said."

After its initial deliberations, BJP has already hinted at changing about 40% of its sitting MPs to beat anti-incumbency and poor performance.The saffron party also doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to release the name of its candidates.“BJP will decide on the candidates for LS election only a day ahead of filing the nomination papers to avoid conflicts within the party. The first phase of polling will be on April 29. This time winnability would be the main criteria and the party is in a mood to drop names of more than 40% sitting MPs including those who have not performed well during the last five years,” a senior state BJP functionary told TOI.BJP veteran Babulal Gaur, joined by a few other local leaders, has also demanded to field local candidates fromBhopalincluding other prominent constituencies in theLok Sabhaelection to check defection and sabotage in the party.“I had been personally offered a ticket by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Bhopal visit last year when he said, ‘Gaur Saab Ek Baar Aur’ (One more time, Mr Gaur). I am expecting that party would field me from Bhopal seat,” reiterated Gaur. The BJP veteran was joined by former minister Umashankar Gupta who lost the assembly poll from Bhopal South Central seat.“Gaur ji and I favour of local candidates, but would leave the decision to the party. If offered the seat, I would contest from Bhopal,” Gupta told reporters after a short meeting with Gaur at the latter's official residence, on Tuesday.Other leaders who have staked a claim from Bhopal include sitting MP Alok Sanjar, Bhopal mayor Alok Sharma and state BJP vice-president Vijesh Lunawat. Two state spokespersons, Deepak Vijayavargiya and Rajneesh Agrawal were also demanding tickets from Vidisha and Sagar respectively.Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is eying Vidisha seat from where Union ministerSushma Swarajhas declined to contest.Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar is finding its difficult in Gwalior and is seeking a ticket from Khajuraho, Vidisha or Bhopal while BJP state president Rakesh Singh will contest from his home constituency in Jabalpur.Party sources saidRajya Sabhamember Prabhat Jha, Union minister Thawar Chand Gehlot and former Union minister Faggan Singh Kulaste and former state BJP chief Nandkumar Singh Chouhan may also be fielded by the party.Apart from Bharti, all are members of state election committee.“The national leadership is holding a series of meeting to decide the criteria for ticket.”, BJP national vice-president, Prabhat Jha told TOI.State BJP office-bearers and senior leaders who are claiming for the tickets include state general secretary, Vishnu Dutt Sharma, former union ministers Satyanarayan Jatia and Vikram Verma, former Rajya Sabha member Raghunandan Sharma, senior leaders Maya Singh, Krishna Murari Moghe, Kailash Vijayavargiya, Jayant Malaiya, state vice-president Vinod Gotia, former MLA Chaudhary Rakesh Singh, state Mahila Morcha president Lata Elkar, Archana Chitnis, sitting MP from Morena Anup Mishra, former MLA from Badnwar, Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat, and MLA fromMandsaur, Yashpal Singh Sisodia.A few dissent notes have already arrived from within the saffron party.

Very soon,"" Guaido told supporters, who chanted back: ""Yes, you can!""Demonstrators banged pots and sounded car horns at the protest in a square in the east of the capital. Many waved large banners calling on Maduro to go.""The situation is very difficult, we are hoping that this government will change. We've had enough of this chaos!"" said one of the demonstrators, Miguel Gonzalez.""With courage and strength I asked you to believe in yourselves, that Venezuela would emerge from the darkness, that the end of the usurpation is very close,"" said Guaido, who is recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries.Venezuela's state prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, told reporters he would place Guaido under investigation for ""his alleged involvement in the sabotage of the Venezuelan electric grid.""It is the first government move against the US-backed Guaido since his return to Venezuela last week after defying a travel ban to visit several allied South American leaders.Maduro has blamed a devastating multi-day blackout plaguing Venezuela on Washington, and declared ""victory"" in what he called an ""electricity war"" triggered by the Pentagon.He also called for support from allies including Russia and China as well as the United Nations in investigating the US ""cyber attack"" he said was responsible for the blackout.While Maduro pointed the finger at Washington, critics have long blamed the government for failing to maintain the power grid.Guaido, 35, is seeking to capitalize on public anger over the blackout, which has piled misery on a population suffering years of economic crisis and shortages of food and medicine under Maduro.The youthful opposition chief — locked in a power struggle with Maduro since declaring himself interim president on January 23 — has branded the socialist leader a ""usurper"" over his re-election in May, widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.Outlining the case against Guaido, Saab said the opposition leader had disseminated a series of messages that have ""stoked violence.""""At this moment, he appears as one of the intellectual authors of this electrical sabotage and is practically calling for a civil war in the middle of this blackout,"" Saab said.The US kept up the pressure, with special envoyElliott Abramssaying Washington would soon impose ""very significant additional sanctions"" on institutions doing business with Maduro's government.It has already targeted a growing list of individuals and companies linked to the Maduro government, including state oil companyPDVSA.At Guaido's urging, the opposition-dominated National Assembly declared a ""state of alarm"" on Monday to pave the way for the delivery of international aid, 250 tons of which has been stuck for a month at Venezuela's borders with Colombia and Brazil.However, with Maduro controlling the military and security services -- which are currently preventing aid from entering the country -- he has no means of enforcing it.Maduro used the military to begin distributing food, water and other assistance in several districts on Tuesday.Marshalled by security forces, crowds formed impatient lines at water trucks in some areas, as they waited to fill containers. But tensions were running high amid the shortages.""I saw people lining up for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of rice, and the shopkeepers had to fire shots in the air to keep the lines under control,"" Alberto Barboza, 26, told AFP in the oil capital Maracaibo.""I heard a lot of shooting,"" said Barboza, adding that a local bakery and a tire shop were looted.The blackout has left millions without running water. Many people lined up to buy bottled water in Caracas supermarkets, but most are reduced to desperate means -- besieging fountains in public parks and any available water sources around the capital.Maduro had called for armed grassroots groups known as ""colectivos"" to hit back against what he called attacks encouraged by the US against the country's electrical grid.The opposition says the colectivos have been armed by the government and act as militia.Power has been restored to some areas since the weekend, but service has been intermittent and often drops out.Businesses and schools remained shuttered on Maduro's orders, as they have been since the blackout began.As the situation worsened, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Washington is withdrawing all its remaining personnel from the US embassy in Caracas. All non-emergency staff were ordered to leave on January 24.The State Department said all US citizens residing or traveling in Venezuelan ""should depart"" the country, citing ""crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure and arbitrary arrest and detention of US citizens."""

The 60-year-old policy was passed by the Delhi cabinet on March 6 and has been sent to the lieutenant governor for approval. But with the Model Code of Conduct kicking in after the announcement of the LS poll dates, it is unlikely that the policy will be notified.The teachers have been protesting since March 1, after their contract ended. ""We have been here for long time because it is the BJP who can ask LG Baijal to pass the policy. We are unemployed now but no one seems to be bothered. When we were ready to get into the bus, the police dragged us. Is this the way teachers are to be treated?"" said Shoaib Rana, a guest teacher and member of All India Guest Teachers Association.However, aDelhi Policeofficer said there was no case of manhandling. ""No manhandling took place. But the protestors scuffled and resisted when they were being detained,"" said a police officer.As the teachers were taken to Parliament Street police station, Congress leader and former Delhi education minister, Kiran Walia, met them. She asked the teachers to form a delegation to decide on how they want to take the protest forward. ""I am in fully support of your demands and think that there should be a policy for guest teachers,"" said Walia.Later, when the teachers were released, they went back to the BJP office and continued their protest."

Here is what stakeholders have to say on the matterStudents are our first responsibilityIn view of our responsibility towards the youth of the nation, teachers should refrain form long strikes. They should opt for symbolic protest to express dissent against the administration or the government. Month-long strike by university or college teachers ultimately takes huge toll on the education system. We need to show some moral responsibility towards the society as we are teacher first and activist later.— Amit Singh, assistant professor, Department of Political Science, Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, DUStudents are victimsDissent and protests are essential part of any democratic society, and educational institutions are no exception. However, such protests must never take the form of unending strike with an objective to disrupt the classes or shut down the academic activities of a college or a university. The only victims of the teachers' strike are the students, who lose crucial learning time when their teachers go on strike.— Dhananjay Singh, professor, Centre for English Studies, School of Language Literature and Culture Studies, JNUNeed middle path to resolve issuesMahatma Gandhi with his non-cooperation movement showed a path to the world on peaceful protests. Presently, teachers from different universities are also adopting the same methods of non-cooperation by launching strikes and dharnas to press their demands like regularisation and absorption of temporary teachers and thus make the university administration to react positively to the fundamental demands of teachers. Teaching is a noble profession that shapes the character and future of an individual. But, how can a society grow if the future of a teacher is uncertain? Such activities do have an adverse impact on education that risks the academic pursuits of thousands of young innocent students. It is therefore the teachers and the administration who should understand their responsibilities and find a middle path to resolve the issues.— Kaushal Kishore, assistant professor, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, VadodaraExpress discontent peacefullySometimes the strikes are for a valid cause, but the fact is that teachers are expected to teach us, which makes a strong argument against their cause. These strikes are directly harming the students and our studies to the point where we no longer know if or when we will be able to finish our syllabi.They are standing up to the administration but it is the students who are bearing the brunt of their protests. We don’t even know whether these strikes are directly affecting the administration but its effect is visible on the students. Again, their cause is completely valid but they should perhaps use a different method to express their discontent.— Aishani Jaiswal, student ASRD College"

For the AAP, demand for full statehood is the central theme of its Lok Sabha campaign.The protesters, roped in from the party's frontal organisations, raised the demand for full statehood and claimed that Congress was not interested in getting full statehood for Delhi.The protest is likely to increase hostility between AAP and Congress, both still exploring the possibility of an alliance.With the demand for full statehood at its centre, AAP has launched its campaign for LS polls and CM Kejriwal has made it clear that ""this time Delhiites will vote to make Delhi (a) full state and not to elect the PM.""AAP has ruled Delhi for over four years now after forming the government with a brute majority. But the recurring theme of its tenure has been the constant tussle between the state government and the Centre. The party claims that it cannot do as much as it wanted for public welfare because of ""obstructions"" caused by the Centre, through the LG.

Neither the state nor the Centre has provided us with minimum basic amenities. When we were trying to live peacefully with whatever facilities we have, they deployed security personnel in the hills. Some of our brothers and friends were labelled as Maoists, arrested and harassed. Police and security personnel have snatched our happiness from us,” said Pusika.Lada Sikaka, a senior leader of the samiti, said their people fall ill by drinking contaminated water. “We do not have roads or teachers to educate our children. We live in the hills like aliens. Nobody pays heed to our problems. Why will we take part in the elections? So, we have decided to boycott them,” he added.Chandra Majhi, sarpanch of Trilochanpur panchayat, said newborns and children in the hills die due to lack of health facilities nearby. Malnutrition and infection are taking a toll on children’s health. “Even the security personnel deployed in the area have taken shelter in Trilochanpur panchayat office and we cannot carry out work there. I feel helpless that I cannot work for my tribal brothers and sisters. I support their election boycott call,” he added.This tribe came to the limelight for protesting against bauxite mining in Niyamgiri hills and saying no to mining through gram sabhas organised in the hills in 2013. Around 8,000 Dongria Kondhs live in more than 100 villages in the hills.Superintendent of police (Kalahandi) Battula Gangadhar said police do not arrest anybody from the Niyamgiri hills. “It is not true that local police harass the Dongria Kondhs. We have not arrested anybody from the hills. The CRPF personnel stay inside the old building of the panchayat; work on the new panchayat office is going on smoothly,” he added."

Pandey did not join in the protest on both the days. While other MLAs, including cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, camped at the plaza on Friday night, Pandey did not appear even once.It is not the first time Pandey has given a miss to a programme organized by the district Congress leadership, especially MP Ravneet Bittu.

Even at that time, Pandey did not go to the spot, despite the area being in his constituency. And recently, Pandey also demanded a ticket for contesting the MP elections from Ludhiana constituency.When asked about his absence from the protest, Pandey said: “I did not receive any message from Congress MP Ravneet Bittu to reach there. Moreover, I do not believe in becoming a part of any type of activity that inculcates wrong habits among people.” Bittu, on the other hand, however, said: “The protest was for the cause of public welfare, so MLA Pandey should have come on his own.” He said he had not sent official invites to other MLAs as well.In the protest, Congress MLA from East (Sanjay Talwar), from Central constituency (Surinder Dawar), and Gill constituency (Kuldeep Vaid) had come. But apart from Pandey, even councillors from his group did not go there, except district Congress president Ashwani Sharma.‘Not informed about budget meeting’Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey claimed he and his group of councillors were unaware of the MC budget meeting, and were not delivered the meeting’s agenda. He said this is the reason councillors from North constituency did not attend the meeting. On the other hand, MC secretary Tajinder Panchi denied the allegation, and said they had circulated the agenda to everybody before the meeting."

The NGO has threatened to launch an agitation if NMRDA issues notice to any structure in Metro Region before doing the same to VCA.President Prashant Pawar said NMRDA should withdraw all notices issued in Metro Region to many people if it doesn’t have the “courage to act against the stadium”. “The public information officer at the collector’s office submitted an affidavit to the state information commission (SIC) in June last year confirming the building plan of the stadium was not sanctioned by the collector. NMRDA still writes a letter to the collector asking whether it has given sanction. Instead of giving a clear reply, the collector replied that NMRDA should take a decision on the building plan,” he said.Pawar added that NMRDA wrote a letter to state’s law and judiciary department to understand if an environment clearance was applicable to the stadium or not. “This was done only to keep VCA’s application seeking completion and occupancy certificate pending. MPCB had already stated that the stadium requires an environment clearance and VCA does not have it. NMRDA should reject VCA’s application immediately and issue notice under MRTP Act,” he said.The NGO told NMRDA commissioner on March 1 that VCA’s application seeking completion and occupancy certificate is pending with itself. “The NMRDA should have stopped VCA from hosting India’s match with Australia,” he said.Vijaykumar Shinde, Ravindra Itkelwar, Milind Mahadevkar, Ravishankar Mandawkar, Nilikesh Kohle, Uttam Sulke and others were present at the press conference."

However, the parties agreed to accept the request made by chief ministerPinarayi Vijayan, who said the current political situation demanded a strong and united fight from the LDF.Sources said leaders of JD (S) and LJD criticised the practice of two Left parties dividing positions among them by leaving democratic parties in the lurch. NCP also demanded a seat. Sources quoted that a JD (S) leader even said there was no point in calling the front as Left Democratic Front. However, Vijayan, who listened to the criticism, requested all to cooperate with the seat sharing formula. He said all issues raised by the constituents could be discussed after the election. The state committee of LDF then decided to allot 16 seats to CPM and four to CPI.

After half an hour of arbitration, Dutta relented when AGP members promised to take up his grievances with party heads.In January, AGP had walked out of its partnership with ruling BJP after the Union cabinet made it clear it intended to push the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill through Parliament. The bill, which proposed citizenship for non-Muslim migrants fromBangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, would go against the regionalist agenda the AGP has built its political capital on for more than three decades now.AGP spokesperson Manoj Saikia denied Dutta was associated with the party and, instead, said such anger is an evidence of the ""attachment"" people have with it.""People of Assam have faith in AGP. Such anger shows people's support and emotional connect with the party, We want to assure people that we will act only with the indigenous people's interests in mind,"" Saikia said.The party is yet to take a call on any alliance formation for the Lok Sabha election. ""We have been seeking feedback from our party members. We have not yet decided if we want to ally with any party,"" AGP president Atul Bora said.Congress has been courting AGP since its breakup with BJP, with former CM Tarun Gogoi also backing the idea. Sources within the party indicated that it has been looking for partners backing the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord."

The university doubled the fees for MBA courses. Certain fees such as amenities development fund, industry-interface fund and placement assistance fund that were paid by students only once during the admission have now been made yearly. Moreover, the university has also hiked the fees under these heads,” said SFI, Pondicherry University (PU) chapter secretary Abhijeet Sudhakaran said.The students’ forums argued that the exorbitant hike in fees structure will deny the opportunity of the students from the poor economic and social background from pursuing higher education.“We strongly oppose this huge increase in the fees and view it as an anti-student move. SFI demands immediate revoke of the fee revision,” said SFI-PU president C P Uvais.The university sources said the academic council and executive council have given the approval to hike the fees for all the courses from the next academic year.“The university decided to hike the fees for all the courses (not only MBA courses) from the next academic year. The school of management was the first to commence admission for the next academic year and the prospectus for the MBA courses furnished the revised fees structure. The revised fees structures of other courses will be furnished as and when the respective departments release admission notification and issue prospectus,” said a university official.Another official said the university hiked the fees last time in 2012-13. “It is almost seven years since the fee structure was revised. We revised the fee structure keeping in mind all the necessary factors. Moreover, the support from the funding agencies has been dwindling over the years,” said the official.However, the students’ union leaders argued that hike in certain heads of the fee structure was exorbitant. “For example, the alumni association fund was hiked from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000, additional lab facility fund from Rs 200 to Rs 5,000 and tour and industrial visit fund from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 among others. We have submitted a memorandum to the university registrar urging the university management to withdraw the hike in fee structure,” said Sudhakaran."

Many tribals have threatened to demonstrate in front of Kalahandi collector’s office on Friday.Lingaraj, adviserNiyamgiri Surakhya Samiti, a tribal outfight opposed to mining in Niyamgiri, was sent to Bhawanipatna Jail on Wednesday after police arrested him for allegedly possessing arms, supporting the Maoists and mobilising other tribal leaders against mining in Lanjigarh.Theopil Gamang, convenor, Ingenious People’s Forum, a tribal outfit, termed Azad’s arrest as illegal. ""It’s a government ploy to favour certain companies by arresting Azad as he is opposed to mining Niyamgiri. He has been fighting for protection of tribals’ interest,” Theopil said.Prafulla Samantara, an activist who has also been at the forefront of anti-mining movement of tribals in Niyamgiri hills, said it’s a cause of serious concern that the government is trying to falsely implicate Azad as Maoist sympathiser. “It seems, a well-crafted strategy to keep Azad behind bars to kill the tribals’ movement,” he said.Satya Mahar, the convenor of Niyamgiri Surakhya Samiti said Lingraj was the first person, who had motivated the locals of Trilochanpur to participate in the 2014 election when Maoists had threatened the people to keep away themselves from voting. “How could be Lingaraj linked to Maoists,” Satya asked. The government is trying to supress the tribal voice against the mining, he added.Police sources said Lingaraj was arrested in the wake of DGP R P Sharma directing police to nab the anti-socials, Maoists sympathisers and other disturbing elements before the general elections-2019.Additional SP of Kalahandi, M K Mohanta told the reporters in Bhawanipatna on Thursday that Lingaraj was arrested in two different cases.Police said, Lingaraj along with tribals had agitated and threatened in front of Vedanta gate for which Vedanta security head, Rajiv Ranjan had lodged an FIR against Azad and his associates in 2017.In 2019, Bijepur police station, ASI-Tankadhar Budhia, had registered another case against Lingaraj and four other tribal leaders for holding rallies and threatening the police against setting up of proposed CRPF camp at Trilochanpur.State co-ordinator of SC, ST, OBC and minority Sangram Samiti, Satyabadi Naik said Lingaraj peacefully protested against the CRPF camp bcause the jawans forcibly acquired the panchayat building of Trilochanpur in the name of proposed construction."

While they released 15 stray dogs — who were caught from near Mohali’s Daun village and packed in a vehicle — at the boundary of the township, cattle loaded in two of the 11 vehicles were let loose some metres away at a ground in Phase VIII. Later, the rest of the cattle in nine tractor-trolleys were shifted to the Mohali administration trucks. Each vehicle had about 10 cattle.The farmers presented a memorandum to officer on special duty (OSD) to chief minister Sandeep Brar. Brar said, “We have accepted their memorandum. We will arrange for a date to have a dialogue with the CM.”Ajmer Singh Lakhowal, who led the activists, said, “Stray dogs are killing children and elderly in villages. Stray cattle are destroying crops, putting farmer in debts. But the government is not taking any action.”Earlier, the protesters started gathering at Amb Sahib Gurdwara around 10am. At about 3pm, 600 farmers, followed by 12 tractor-trolleys, marched towards the ground opposite the gurdwara.Raising slogans against Union minster Meneka Gandhi and CM CaptainAmarinder Singh, they said the leaders were being negligent towards human lives, but making laws to save stray animals.The Chandigarh police were ready with cattle catchers’ team, comprising 10 to 12 men, equipped with ropes, sticks and trucks.

Therefore, we released them near the border.”The Chandigarh-Mohali entry road was closed due to the protest, as the UT police had sealed the border near YPS crossing.The farmers threatened to hold a similar protest if the menace was not checked. Next time, they warned, they would release stray dogs and cattle outside the houses of the CM and bureaucrats in Chandigarh.BKU activists defy Supreme Court orderThe BKU activists disobeyed the Supreme Court order under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act that says a stray dog should be release at the same place from where it was lifted. The farmers had lifted 15 dogs from near Daun village in Mohali and released them at the Mohali-Chandigarh border. When asked about the Act, the farmers said they do not care about guidelines that protect animals who kill humans. Hira Singh, a farmers, said, “Stray dogs have been killing infants, children and the elderly in Punjab. But the government is protecting dogs instead of humans. If a lion turns a man eater, he is killed. Here, stray dogs have mauled several people to death in the past few months, but the government has failed to act.”They said recently, a pack of stray dogs had mauled a toddler to death near Rajpura and killed an 80-year-old woman near Moga."

But the Karaite Jewish community's concern that thecablecarwill desecrate its ancient cemetery may provide the biggest hurdle of all to government planners.Israel's Tourism Ministry, along withJerusalemcity officials, proposed thecablecaras a solution for ferrying tourists over traffic-snarled city streets and steep hills to the iconic walled Old City. The route would start near the ""First Station,'' a renovated old railway station that's now a popular pedestrian mall, and soar over the biblical Valley of Hinnom, to Mount Zion and the outskirts of the Old City, 2 kilometers (1 mile) away.InJerusalem, a city with over 3,000 years of history, virtually any development project can be contentious. New construction often grinds to a halt after an incidental discovery of antiquities and archaeologists are brought in to salvage ancient remains.After weighing various options for thecablecar, planners chose the route as the most sensitive way to leave the city's historical treasures intact. But they apparently were unaware of the Karaite cemetery.""They're coming and trampling an entire community of 40,000 people and erasing them, not paying them heed,'' said Avi Yefet, a member of the Karaite community.OppositeJerusalem's Old City walls, the grassy one-acre plot is still actively used by the Karaite community. Some tombs date back 2,000 years.Standing amid the wildflowers and lush grass surrounding the grave of his great-great-grandfather, once the head ofJerusalem's Karaite community, Yefet said he doubts thecablecarplanwill go through. He is all for modern development, he said, but not at the expense of his heritage.The Karaites emerged as a distinct community within Judaism in the early 9th century, interpreting the Hebrew Bible in a more literal fashion and rejecting rabbinic Jewish tradition codified in the Talmud, seen by most observant Jews as themain sourceof religious law.Consequently, their customs differ from mainstream Jewish practices: Judaism is passed down through the father, not the mother. They strictly adhere to laws of ritual purity and observe holidays according to sighting of the new moon.Today, Israel's Karaite community is based in Ramle, just outside ofTel Aviv, where their main synagogue is located. An estimated 500 families also live inJerusalem, home to a medieval Karaite synagogue.Though they serve in theIsraelimilitary and consider themselves Jewish in every respect, they face constant friction from Israel's rabbinic authorities when it comes to marriage, divorce and kosher slaughter.""Karaite Judaism preserves the oldest conception that most closely resembles the Second Temple era,'' said Shlomo Gaver, director of Israel's UniversalKaraite Judaismorganization.The Karaites said theJerusalemDevelopment Authority, one of the government organizations responsible for theJerusalemcablecarproject, contacted them last August and proposed covering the cemetery in order to accommodate observant Jews who are ``kohanim'' _ descendants of priests from the ancient temples inJerusalemwho cannot enter cemeteries out of concern for ritual purity.""According to Karaite religious law, any covering over a cemetery invalidates the cemetery,'' said Gaver. ""Every member of the community feels personally insulted.''""Nobody asked or was concerned whether it was a problem according to Karaite law if they were to build something over the cemetery,'' said Rom Golan, the Karaite community's attorney. ``When we explained it was impossible according to religious law, we stopped hearing from them.''The Tourism Ministry referred questions to the development authority, which said the planning process was conducted with transparency but that ``unfortunately, the Karaite representatives chose to unilaterally stop the meetings.''""We would be happy if they would choose to, once again, conduct a deep and thorough discussion of the possible solutions to their matter,'' it added, without saying whether the project will proceed.The government says the $55 millioncablecarproject will make it easier for tourists to reach key religious and archaeological sites. The ministry submitted theplanto Israel's National Infrastructure Committee, and the public has until April 3 to present objections.The Karaites are just one of several groups opposed to the project.The planned route also passes through a national park and crosses fromJerusalem's western,Israeliside, into eastJerusalem. Israel captured eastJerusalemin the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, a move unrecognized by most of the international community.The Palestinians claim eastJerusalemas capital of a future state and view thecablecarproject as another move to permanently bind eastJerusalemto Israel. The planned route would also be built over the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan.Critics including archaeologists, architects, environmentalists, Palestinian Jerusalemites, and religious communities contend thecablecarwill be an eyesore that will detract fromJerusalem's unique landscape and damage historic remains.The Israel Association of Architects and Urban Planners penned an open letter in October criticizing the utility, aesthetics and value of the project.""Nowhere in the world is there a precedent for something like this, in which a historic city hands over part of what is recognized as a historical and heritage site for a development of the kind proposed,'' the organization said.The Karaite community has called for an alternative route, saying the project would inflict ``grave harm to the Jewish Karaites, the grounds of the cemetery, and the grieving families of the dead both past and future.''For the Karaites, who say they face constant marginalization by Israel's Rabbinate, protecting their cemetery is another uphill battle.""We feel as though we always have to chase, chase, chase in order to realize our basic rights as citizens,'' said Gaver."

The BJP countered the protests, asking whether the Congress was protesting against an order of the Supreme Court or supporting the illegal mining for which its MLA has been convicted.Dharnas were staged by party workers at all district headquarters in the state, after which Congress workers handed over memorandums to the respective district collectors. Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, “The BJP wants to hold on to power through intimidation and by creating fear among opponents. Several BJP leaders have been convicted in the past for serious offences, but no action has been taken against them.”Countering the allegation, BJP leader Bharat Pandya asked if the Congress was protesting against an order by the Supreme Court or whether it was supporting the act of illegal mining by one of its MLAs. “The MLA has been disqualified according to an order of the Supreme Court and notifications by the Election Commission. The Congress is not staging dharnas against terrorism or paying tributes to the soldiers who died in the terror attack, but is supporting illegal mining by staging dharnas,” he said.The Congress is up in arms because it has lost three of its MLAs in the past few months, bringing down its tally in the Gujarat assembly from 77 to 74, while the BJP tally has crossed the psychological three-figure mark. Quite simply, the BJP is slowly but surely chipping away the Congress base with the aim of repeating its 2014 general election results, when it won all the 26 lok sabha seats in Gujarat. In fact, top ruling party ministers and leaders have been openly saying that all disgruntled leaders from the Congress are welcome to join the BJP.In July, OBC strongman and Congress MLA from Jasdan, Kunvarji Bavaliya, had quit the party and joined the BJP. In the bypoll held in December, Bavaliya won on a BJP ticket. Last month, Asha Patel, Congress MLA from Unjha had quit and joined the BJP after a few days. And on Tuesday, Congress MLA Bhagwan Barad from Talala was disqualified by the assembly Speaker.Clearly, the move to win Kunvarji Bavaliya over turned out to be a political masterstroke for the BJP. The Koli community-dominated Jasdan constituency had always remained elusive for theBharatiya Janata Party. It could not wrest this seat from the Congress even when Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat.Interestingly, Bavaliya was made minister in the Vijay Rupani cabinet within hours of him resigning as MLA of the Congress party in July 2018. Asha Patel too was closely associated with Hardik Patel’s Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and she had defeated BJP bigwig Narayan Patel in the 2017 assembly elections by a margin of 20,000 votes. Interestingly, it was the first time since 1972 that the Congress had won this seat in north Gujarat."

The general body also okayed Rs50 crore payment to theOCWby diverting a part of the Rs200 crore loan the civic body plans to avail.All Congress corporators and independent corporator Abha Pande objected to the proposals, while BSP andShiv Senacorporators did not participate in the meeting. The general body also approved an extension of 18 months for completion of the 24x7 water supply project.Under the OTS, NMC will waive off penalty of Rs41 crore levied on OCW for breach of agreement in last seven years. The civic body will also pay an escalation cost of Rs52 crore for 24x7 project. The operator also stands to benefit by over Rs40 crore following a decision to extend performance parameters by three more years, up to March 2022. Thus, the OTS will be of over Rs 123 crore.Apart from Rs50 crore payment, pending bills of Rs24 crore will be released to the OCW soon.Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi said OTS was required to complete the 24x7 water project. “OCW is at fault. NMC also committed some mistakes. Therefore, we came up with the OTS. We have denied OCW’s demand to give exemption from spending Rs111.37 crore under renewal and replacement (R&R). We have also not approved interest of Rs28 crore on cost escalation,” he said.Congress corporators Praful Gudadhe, Manoj Sangole, Sandip Sahare, Harish Gwalbanshi, Kamlesh Chaudhary and others objected to the proposals stating that OCW should be ousted for its failure to complete 24x7 project in time. “OCW’s failure is resulting in supply of contaminated water, unequal distribution, cost escalation, water crisis, inflated bills,” they alleged.Mayor Nanda Jichkar and deputy mayor Deepraj Pardikar directed the NMC officials to solve the issues raised by corporators.Gudadhe said waiving off penalty was an irregularity. “NMC officials had levied penalty as OCW failed to fulfil its obligations as per the agreement. None of the corporators are aware about conditions the OCW has met in last seven years,” he said.Joshi directed the NMC officials to prepare action taken report (ATR) of agreement and table before general body in next meeting.Gudadhe said the ruling party should not hurry in approving the OTS and wait till submission of the action taken report. “Citizens know the reason behind BJP favouring the OCW,” he said.Joshi and former mayor Pravin Datke objected to Gudadhe’s statement and asked to give proof of relations between the OCW and BJP leaders.Pande said, “NMC had not furnished data of tankers being operated by the OCW. Are tankers belonging to some office-bearers being operated by the OCW,” she questioned. Pande’s statement resulted in heated arguments as BJP corporators raised objection and asked Pande to give proof.Sahare alleged that the NMC decided to avail Rs200 crore loan from a particular bank without holding discussions with other institutions despite knowing that this would cause loss to the NMC.Gwalbanshi said instead of taking loan, the NMC should seek grants from CMDevendra Fadnavisand Union minister Nitin Gadkari."

The protesting leaders later courted arrest and were taken to the police station.The leaders demanded that the chief minister should ask Ashu to resign, who should be booked for promoting corruption and threatening officials.Senior AAP leader and Leader of Opposition (LOP), Harpal Singh Cheema while addressing the gathering alleged that the state government was entrenched in corruption with its ministers indulging in open loot and thus making a mockery of the law. Climing that people in Punjab and his party would not accept such malpractices, he demanded that the the chief minister CaptainAmarinder Singhshould immediately sack the tainted minister to re-instill a semblance of peoples’ faith in the established democratic system. He also alleged that the Captain government had left its predecessor SAD-BJP government far behind in the corruption.Other prominent leaders who joined the protest included Deputy LOP Sarvjit Kaur Manuke, MLA and chief of the party’s core committee, principal Budhram, Kultar Singh Sandhawan (MLA), Manjit Singh Bilaspur (MLA), senior leader Suresh Goel,MalwaZone-1 chief Gurdit Singh Sekhon, district president Daljit Singh Bhola, senior leader Ahbaab Garewal, and Aman Mohi, besides others.Deputy leader of opposition Sarvjit Manuke said that the local MLA and the minister Ashu had been hogging the limelight for all the wrong reasons and was deeply involved in corruption. “His role in the scam became even clearer from the audio clips showing the minister threatening the investigating officers that had gone viral on the social media platforms.”She added that the issue was raised in Vidhan Sabha during the recently concluded Budget session, and the members even staged a walk out but the government has failed to take any concrete action. “This points towards the government’s ‘non-serious stance’ on the issue that had rocked the House for days,” she said.Kotkapura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan added that despite assurance by CM Captain Amarinder Singh on the floor of the House, ‘nothing concrete’ had come out of the narrative, as “he neither sacked Ashu nor ordered an inquiry into the entire scam.”Others who were present during the protest included Rajinder Pal Kaur Sheena, Master Hari Singh, Gurjit Singh Gill, Dr Tej Pal Gill, Ravinder Pal Singh Palli, Punit Sahni, Sahil Goel, Sonu Katyal, Harnek Sekhon, and Nanak Singh. As AAP leaders were protesting against the cabinet minister, mayor Balkar Sandhu was seen convincing the leaders, including deputy LOP Manuke to call off the protest.Meanwhile Ashu was in Chandigarh on Tuesday said the protesters have been politicising the issue without any proof. ""If CM has said anything in assembly it has some meaning. The opposition parties are raising hue and cry over nothing. If they have some substantial proof they should make it public instead of doing such protests. Probe will make everything clear,” he said."

They demanded the regional transport authority and government to immediately withdraw the ban on Diesel Auto registrations.In Dehradun, there are approximately 2,300 registered auto-rickshaws out of which 1,100 autos are diesel - which remained stranded for almost half of the day on Tuesday giving a tough time to the commuters.“I could reach office around 12 pm on Tuesday as there was an acute shortage of public vehicles. The situation was better in the evening though,” said Simmy Karanwal, a banker.The state government, last year, placed a ban on diesel autos plying on city roads and replace it with battery operated vehicles and LPG fuel to minimise pollution. According to Doon Auto Rickshaw Union, the legality of this decision is questionable and discriminatory.Pankaj Arora, a leader of Doon Auto Rickshaw Union, said that the government has taken no action against diesel cars which are far more in number than the autos.“Latest BSIV diesel autos are considered to be as clean as LPG autos. There are hardly 1,100 diesel auto-rickshaws in the city which have been banned. However, there are close to a lakh diesel cars against which no action has been taken. Large eight seater diesel autos and four wheeler commercial passenger vehicles which do not have city permits are plying inside the city area without any action being taken against them. This is injustice,” he added.He further alleged that it seems that the decision is taken due to some vested interests.“At the same meeting where Regional Transport Authority (RTA) had banned diesel auto-rickshaws, 170 odd permits were issued to Small 4Wh Diesel Passenger commercial vehicles, but fresh and replacement permits of diesel 3+1 autos have been banned,” he added.Vinay Singh, an auto driver, said that the RTA’s decision is discriminatory and acting against auto-rickshaws which offer economical public transportation to the common people. “This decision looks one-sided and taken only against diesel auto-rickshaws where there are a lot of other diesel vehicles freely plying in the city and creating more pollution than our autos.”"

He added, “We demand an action against those involved in allowing school students to a political rally.”The school management, on the other hand, rubbished the allegation of political motivation. “I was informally invited to the rally by Congress leaders Prabhakar Tirkey and former mayor Rama Xalxo. Since the students were interested in attending the rally, I allowed them,” principal of the school, Sister Mary Grace told TOI.“The only interest I had was in the fact thatRahul Gandhiis the son and grandson of two former prime ministers. If the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been in Ranchi and I was approached by BJP leaders to allow my students there, I would have happily done so,” she added.Though several reports of alleged action on the school authorities surfaced, education secretary A P Singh clarified that no written complaint reached the department till Tuesday evening. “We haven’t received any complaint yet. There is no regulation that restricts free movement of students after school hours. We do have a restriction on district administration involving school students in events and rallies during school hours to welcome guests.”"

Senior BJD leader and MLA Sanjay Kumar Das Burma, who was leading the protest, sat in front of the meeting venue and raised slogans. Due to the vehement protest, Sinha and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan entered the venue through the second gate amidst heavy security.Das Burma said the BJP-led Centre has announced the formation of South Coast Railway (SCoR) without consulting Odisha. As the Centre has created the SCoR considering the geographical area of Andhra Pradesh, similar demand of Odisha should be considered and Jharsuguda, Rourkela and some other areas should be brought under ECoR, he added. He said people of the state will resort to economic blockade if the Centre does not reconsider Odisha’s demand.Sinha clarified that not even a single inch of railway line in Odisha has been given to the newly-created zone of SCoR. “Odisha part of the Waltair division is with ECoR. We are creating a new railway division at Rayagada by taking Waltair division’s 585 km rail line and adding 363 km rail line of other existing divisions of ECoR. This division will look after the development of railway lines in the backward areas of the state,” he added.When Sinha was asked about inclusion of Rourkela and Jharsuguda part of the state in ECoR, the railway minister said, “Keeping the requirement of Odisha in mind, we will discuss the issue in the future,” he added.He said the Centre has sanctioned Rs 27,000 crore in five years for development of railways in Odisha. Some projects like Khurda-Balangir project are moving slowly due to delay in land acquisition by the state government. “Our work gets affected if land is provided in parts.

Police sources said Mali had a diploma in computers and had stolen Benne’sFacebookpassword. On Saturday, he logged as Benne and posted pro-Pakistan slogans.Following the post,BJPand other Hindu outfits carried out massiveprotestrallies in Ramdurg town on Saturday. They demanded that Benne, a close associate of former MLA Ashok Pattan, be arrested immediately. On Sunday, BJP workers led by MP Suresh Angadi staged a dharna in front of the SP’s office in Belagavi. Angadi challenged the SP to arrest “anti-national” Shafi or take a transfer.Following their complaint, Ramdurg police booked Benne for sedition, among other charges. However, they did not arrest him as he said his Facebook account had been hacked.During preliminary investigations, police found that the reportedly offensive statements had not been posted through Benne’s device. The location of the device and the place from which the comments had been posted were different. Police tracked Mali through his handset, which he had used to post the comments.SP Sudheerkumar Reddy said Mali and Benne had been friends but fell out during the 2018 assembly elections due to a financial dispute. Mali was an internet centre in Ramdurg town between 2013 and 2018 which was frequented by Benne. After the elections, Mali shifted to Kankanwadi and was waiting for a chance to get even with Benne, said the SP.Taking advantage of the heightened emotions following the Pulwama terror attack, he posted the comments in Benne’s name in a bid to defame him.Mali has now been booked for sedition and under sections of the IT Act. SP Reddy also hinted at action to be taken against those who liked and shared the objectionable post."

With the elections around the corner, they said that they needed to bring their needs to corporation’s attention. “We were brought under the corporation in the year 2011, but we do not have any of the privileges that other residents under the corporation enjoy,” said R Pandian, a resident.Even after making many representations to civic authorities to provide them with better roads and potable water, no action has been taken and hencethe residentsdecided to stage a protest. Moorthy said that he had raised the difficulties faced by his people even in the Assembly, but no action was taken. As there is no local body in place, the people must knock on the doors of the corporation office.Areas that come under these 11 wards include Thiruppalai, Kannanendhal, Naganakulam and Annaiyur. As many of the wards lack proper roads, auto rickshaws and cabs refuse to come to their doorsteps to pick them up, said the residents. Now, house tax rates have also been increased and we are now being asked to pay it without being provided with the amenities and it is unjust, they added.There is no underground drainage system and open sewage flows onto the road in many areas. Also, as the roads are in damaged condition, even the private water tankers refuse to come to the areas, the residents said. As there is no pipeline connection, we are forced to purchase water for Rs 10 a pot now and the condition is going to worsen in summer.Chitravel Pandian, secretary of Gurunagar Residents Welfare Association, said that even though their area comes under the corporation limits, they find it difficult to rent their houses. “There are about 50,000 houses in this Assembly segment and corporation gets annual tax revenue of not less than Rs 12 crore from us, but still we do not get any benefit,” he said. The residents said that they would decide on the next course of action if their demands are not met immediately."

Land acquisition laws came with strict provisos, which the state government is looking to dilute,” said the protesters.The proposed changes to the legislation also threatened food security, the activists said, alleging that they favoured industrialists and the real estate sector. “The governor must not approve these alterations,” they said."

This year we were supposed to appear for our second-year exams. If the government, MCI or Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Uttarakhand Medical Education University (HNBUMEU) had issues with our education and exams, they should have informed us about it in 2017 itself. Why have they wasted two precious years of our education?” he added.“How will we be able study for two years’ course in a month?” said another student.Talking to TOI, vice chancellor of HNBUMEU, Dr Hemchandra Pandey who is heading the committee formed by Uttarakhand government in Subharti case said, “The committee in its report has maintained that the shifting of students will be on the basis of marks obtained in NEET for transfer to government colleges. Those with lesser marks will be shifted to private colleges. It also retained the orders of the Supreme Court which said that the second-year MBBS students will also have to appear for the first-year exam after admissions.”He added that the students of second-year will have to re-appear in exams till they receive further guidelines from the government.To recall, the Supreme Court in December last year had ordered the Uttarakhand government to admit 150 students of MBSS first and second year course of SSSMC in other government and private medical colleges across Uttarakhand."

Though I’m back to shoot now, I will not give up on my people and will return to town and see to it that each and every farmer is compensated. I joined this fight only after my mother’s death, but along the way, I have managed to touch many lives and many came to my help.

Major assets and part of the Waltair division has been transferred to the new zone, which is yet another anti-Odisha attitude of the Centre,” BJD leader Sanjay Das Burma said.The railways on February 27 announced its decision to create South Coast Railway comprising the existing Guntakal, Guntur and Vijayawada divisions. According to plan, the Waltair division, which was under ECoR, will be divided into two parts. While one part of the Waltair division will be incorporated in the new zone under Vijayawada division, the other part will be converted into a new division with its headquarters at Rayagada under ECoR.State commerce and transport minister Nrusingha Sahu said Odisha would face major infrastructure loss because of the division of Waltair division though it won’t have a major impact on revenue.Maintenance of most diesel and electric engines and almost all wagons are done in Vishakapatnam, where the railways have been investing continuously over the past decade and half. The diesel shed located in Vishakapatnam is the biggest in the country while there is no such diesel engine shed in Odisha.“With these facilities taken away from ECoR, the railways in Odisha will be in a very precarious position as far as supply of engines and wagons are concerned. Now, ECoR will be highly dependent on other railways and will not be able to serve the need of the people and industries of Odisha,” Sahu said.While the BJD described the Centre’s move as anti-Odisha, the TDP claimed bifurcation of Waltair division will cause revenue loss for Andhra.But the BJP said both the BJD and TDP protest against the central move is politically motivated even though carving out a new zone is a win-win situation for both Odisha and Andhra. “The Centre has fully protected the interests of Odisha while giving Andhra a new zone promised to it during the UPA rule,” BJP state vice-president Sameer Mohanty said."

After sending numerous representations to TRAI, people are waiting for the authorities’ response,” said Shivalinga Patil, president of Naragunda Nagarika Hitha Rakshana Samithi, adding: “A meeting of cable subscribers has been convened next week to discuss the protest plans.”With the regime having rolled out, multi service operators (MSO) have switched off pay channels in most villages. Consumers are getting only free-to-air (FTA) channels along with the default Doordarshan channels.KC Ramakrishnappa, a cable operator from Malur town in Kolar district, who has 800 subscribers, said people are protesting in front of his office demanding their favourite channels back on TV. And they don’t want to pay extra for pay channels.“People are not convinced about the new regime. They ask us what was the need for disruption of a system which had been in place for years. We don’t have an answer,” said Ramakrishnappa.Ramakrishnappa was charging Rs 180 for 440 channels before the new regime was implemented on February 1 (deadline for migration has been extended to March 31). Now, he has to collect Rs 130 (network capacity fee) plus 18% GST, for which a consumer will get 74 FTA channels and 26 mandatory DD channels. If the consumer wants to watch a pay channel, s/he has to pay the maximum retail price (MRP) fixed for the channel, over and above the network capacity fee. For instance, for Colours Kannada, one has to pay Rs 19 plus 18% GST, which amounts to Rs 22.5.If consumers want to watch all channels they were getting earlier, they will end up paying at least Rs 800, considering the MRP of pay channel ranges from Re 1 to Rs 19. “At a time when people are reeling under severe drought and grappling with crop loss, we are forced to ask them to pay more for entertainment,” rued Raju Hiremat, a cable operator from Sindagi in Vijayapura district, who has 1,200 subscribers.He said the government should at least reduce the GST rate from 18% to 5%, while the main demand is to restructure the tariff regime to make entertainment affordable for people, especially in rural areas.“Earlier, the fee structure was differential for urban and rural consumers. The LCOs would collect about Rs 300 in cities like Bengaluru and Mysuru for about 400 channels and around Rs 150 in villages. The government should look at a similar policy,” said Raju Poojari, a consumer activist from Udupi.Govt has to decide on tax rateWe are receiving complaints from cable TV consumers from across India. Most are to do with pricing and GST rates. The government has to take call on the tax rate and policy issuesAravind Kumar, advisor (broadcast and cable services), TRAI"

The evening meeting, which was attended by four deans, director of students’ welfare, estate officer and student representatives, lasted till 6.30pm.Students said PAU should allow cars to their hostels and field areas and designate a parking lot behind Thapar Hall as parking near Gate No 1 doesn’t help the cause.Karanvir, a student representative, said, “Thapar Hall is situated close to departments. Most of our issues will be resolved if the authorities allow parking near the hall. Also, we want cars should be allowed in the field areas.”On the prospectus fee issue, Lovepreet Singh Brar, a student, said, “The authorities should charge for the application. They can charge the rest of the amount if the candidate clears the entrance test and reaches the counseling stage.”Students said they would continue the protest till their demands are not fulfilled.Estate Officer Dr Vishavjit Singh Hans said, “Though we looked at all the demands of students, we won’t soften our stand on the car ban issue. We listened to them and asked them to come up with a proposal that will ease their issues of car parking. The committee has proposed a parking near Thapar Hall, but that is an experimental area of plant breeding department. Besides its feasibility, we also discussed different options to come up with a parking lot that will be convenient for everyone.”"

The students have been protesting from past one month and on February 28, all the opposition bodies of ABVP joined hands and demanded to meet KU Vice-Chancellor (VC) Dr Kailash Sharma to handover the memorandum of demands.The protesting students allege that they were not allowed to meet the VC rather 44 of them were detained from university campus by the district police. KU SHO inspector Satish Kumar said, “The students were attempting to forcibly enter the office of VC, therefore they were removed from outside VC office. The students were later released after verifying their names and courses. We have not taken into custody any of the protesting students.”Omkar Chauhan, president, KU Campus Students Executive Council (KUCSEC) said, “We had approached the protesting bodies to file their demands through the elected students' council but they are denying our existence by saying that we do not give any accreditation to the elected council. They want to meet VC directly after bypassing students' council.”Shahnawaz of Students’ Federation of India (SFI) said, “We just want to meet the VC with a memorandum of our demands but the administration did not allow us to meet and today 44 students were detained from the university campus by the district police. We have never accepted the elected students' council as it was elected through indirect elections and our bodies did not participate in those elections, therefore we wanted to meet the VC directly.”Dr Pawan Sharma, dean student welfare said, “The student elections in the state were resumed after a gap of 22 years on the demand of all the student bodies. After elections, KU has a democratically elected student council which belongs to all the students of the university. If any students or their bodies have any demands they must approach the university through the elected council only. The VC had given time to the protesting bodies, but they did not turn up on that day. Now they are demanding to directly meet him despite when the university has an active student council, which is inappropriate. Politics is being played in the name of demands.”Protesting bodies include National Student Union of India (NSUI), Indian National Students Organisation (INSO), Dr Ambedkar Students Front of India (DASFI), SFI, Ambedkar Students Welfare Association (ASWA), Punjab Students Union (PSU), and Swaraj."

As soon the protesting nurses jumped off the building, they were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The injured nurses have been identified as union President Karamjit Kaur Aulakh and Baljit KaurKhalsa.A class four employee of government Rajindra hospital was also injured and his leg was fractured as Karamjit Kaur Aulakh had fallen on him. The police and doctors, however, were adamant to reveal the name of the injured employee.The deputy commissionerPatialaKumar Amit, however, said that doctors at the government hospital had revealed that Baljit Kaur Khalsa was stable in condition. He said that efforts were made to persuade these nurses but all turned futile as nurses threaten to jump immediately whenever the officials used to climb the same building and reach near them.Notably, the nurses under the ‘Punjab Contractual Nursing and Ancillary Staff’ union were sitting on the protest at government hospital since February 6 while few of these nurses climbed to the building but the number declined totwo nursessitting atop after others were fallen ill one by one.The protesting nurses had announced to jump down from the building around ten days back following which the police and the district administration came on its toes and had installed the mattresses and net to catch the nurses in case they jump.These nurses were promised a meeting with the Chief Minister that was scheduled for February 28. ON Thursday, these nurses had jumped after their talks with the Brahm Mohindra turned fruitless. The protesting nurses under the Punjab Nursing and Ancillary Staff Union also claimed to have met the former Union Minister Preneet Kaur who is also the wife of Chief Minister but all in vain.Sandeep KaurBarnala, said, “The chief minister CaptainAmarinder Singhreached his hometown thrice during out protest but did not even made attempt to meet us instead he dilly dally the matter. We were given the date of the meeting with the CM and were assured we will be regularised if the CM gets convinced but all in vain. Cabinet Minister Brahm Mohindra claimed that the meeting with the CM will be possible next week only. We had end the hunger strike earlier on the assurance of the cops that the CM would meet us. We have been demanding regularisation from last couple of years and the governments befool us before elections by making a false promise but do not regularise us which is our right”Some of the cops nearby had been claiming that the net was not properly installed and was not enough to catch both the nurses in case they jumped together. On Thursday, the net immediately was torn after one of the two nurses had jumped.Since their protest, these nurses had blocked the traffic by sitting on a protest either near the city bus stand or YPS chowk while many times they had marched towards the CM residence but police foiled their all the attempts. A number of officials including SDM, Deputy Commission, SSP Patiala, the health secretary, and others had made efforts to persuade the protesting nurses but they had refused to come down from the government building. In the beginning week of their protest the nurses had kept the Operation Theatres and OPD of the government hospital locked for three days in protest and thus leaving the patient in lurch too.Meanwhile, Bholath MLA Sukhpal Khaira criticised the state government for not regularising the nurses who have been protesting from last one month. He said that Punjab Ekta Party criticise the apathetic and insensitive attitude of the government towards these nurses. He demanded from the CM that besides providing free medical aid and compensation to these nurses, the government should immediately regularise their services."

We completely disagree with his statement as destruction of forests can never be pro-people. The tweaked bill will only benefit a few land owners and farmhouse owners. Unfortunately, the government is not willing to understand people who have bought large land holdings in the forests through fraudulent ways are not economically poor,” said Jitender Bhadana of Save Aravali, an environmentalNGO.Protesters also alleged the government didn’t seek public’s opinion before going ahead with the amendment to PLPA. “There has been no public consultation on PLPA. Despite this, the decision is going to impact our ‘Right to Life’ as preserved in the Constitution. The bill is a gross violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, which clearly states no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty,” said Vinita Singh, a resident of Sector 50.Several people from Delhi and other parts of Haryana also joined the protest. “We are concerned about the environment. My 16-year-old son is suffering from multiple respiratory diseases. The situation is already alarming. If we lose the Aravalis, the region will be left with no forest,” said Rhythm Bhatnagar, a resident of Delhi’s Chhattarpur.Siddharth Verma, who reached the protest site from Faridabad, alleged that the Haryana government took the controversial step to appease the real estatelobbybefore upcoming elections. “I don’t understand how PLPA violates the right of ownership in Haryana, but not in Punjab. The intent is clearly to lure the realtors who eat into the Aravalis and carry out constructions illegally,” he said.The protesters are also using social media and other online platforms to raise their concerns over the threat to the Aravalis in the wake of amendments made to PLPA . “We have been trying to gather support both online too. There are already over 6,500 signatories on change.org to sign a petition against the PLPA amendments. We are also getting a lot of support on Twitter,” said Sanjay Rao, an environmental activist."

The construction of the market is complete but it hasn’t started yet.”Farmers have also demanded to curb the corruption in the co-operative banks in the state. One farmer said that the attitude of the co-operative bank officials is very lethargic and they have to visit many times to get the work done. “There have been cases in which officials have taken out money forloan waiverin the name of a farmer who was already dead. Officials are earning lakhs from corruption and government is a mute spectator,” said Temaram.

Congress supporters led by Kali Charan Mallick, the zonal president of the party in Daringbadi block, alleged that the MLA was involved in corruption and people of the area were not happy with him.

The committee seeks the opinion of the party’s grassroot workers before shortlisting the probable candidates for different constituencies.

In addition, the total amount allocated for maintenance of internal roads and lanes has also been reduced from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 800 crore in this budget.Councillors from the rulingBharatiya Janata Partyat the Centre said that the shrinking share will ultimately affect the civic services in Delhi such as repairing of roads and drains. Agitating councillors even tried to enter the Vidhan Sabha during theprotestbut were stopped by the security staff. They demanded that Delhi government release the outstanding dues of the three corporations.Northcorporationmayor Adesh Gupta said that Delhi government must refrain from misleading the public by means of false advertisements. “The fact is that Delhi government has not issued due arrears of corporations despite the high court’s order. Even the Fifth Delhi Finance Commission’s recommendations have not been implemented till date,” he said.“Delhi government has money to spend on advertisements to mislead the public but there is no money to give to corporations for development works for the benefit of the people of Delhi,” said south corporation mayor Narender Chawla.Of the total amount allocated to civic agencies this year, Rs 1,805 crore will be given as stamp and registration fees and one-time parking charges. “This is ‘mandatory money’ transferred to municipal bodies as per norms,” said Bipin Bihari, east corporation mayor."

All appointments in question were made as per the laid rules and therefore there is no need for retrospective order,” he said.Stating that the fate of scores of teachers hangs in balance, Mhaske said the government must roll-back its decision related to the TET.When contacted, a senior education department official said the government order in question has a base of judgement issued by the Bombay high court on December 12, 2017 in connection with certain petition in similar dispute.“The roll-back of TET as demanded by a section of teachers will be contempt of court. It is a policy decision to be taken by the state government on how to respond to the demand from teachers,” he said.In accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) has laid down the minimum qualifications for a person to be eligible for appointment as a teacher for class I to VIII, as per which the TET is conducted.The state government had notified the TET through government resolution issued on August 23, 2013. It was made mandatory for teaching aspirants willing to serve in educational institutes of all managements and all mediums, including private-aided, unaided and even self-financed schools.The teachers have also decided to step up their agitation in support of demands related to the release of grants for unaided schools, stating that the annual budget of the state for 2019-20 has no concrete assurance to take care of the same."

The protest entered the seventh day on Tuesday. On Monday night, students slept outside the Thapar Hall in teeth-biting cold to make their voice reach the authorities. However, the directorate of student’s welfare, dean Post-Graduate Studies, dean College of Agriculture, and estate officer promised to resolve the matter, but students were not satisfied.Student representative Karanvir Singh Sandhu said: “The university culture of PAU has been compromised. A university is supposed to have openness and a certain amount of freedom given to students. Issues regarding prospectus fee of PAU and hike of fee has also come up, and it needs to be addressed. If things continue like this, that day is not far when PAU will restrict its education just to books. Students leading the protest are being targeted and pressurised in one or the other. But we want to state that these things will not stop us from fighting for our rights, and agitating for our demands. And if our demands are not addressed, we will intensify the protest by starting a hunger strike.”Jasreet Kaur, student of B.Sc Agriculture, said: “The voice of students is being suppressed by PAU authorities. Many times, the students have got together for some cause, but all in vain. Hostel gates were shut at 10.30pm on Monday night without informing us, despite the deadline being 11pm, and they threatened to cancel our hostel seats. Authoritatian decisions are constantly imposed on students. There is no representation of students in decisions taken for the students, which is the main cause of this protest.”Gurinder Singh, student of M.Sc Agri-Economics, said: “Take the recent decision of four-wheeler ban. It was observed and brought to the notice of the authorities many times that four-wheelers without PAU stickers were entering the campus. It was also observed that parents of PAU students were not allowed to enter the campus. The ban was just a ban on student vehicles, and not of any visitors, VIPs, government officials, and persons holding gate passes for transit.”PAU vice-chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon said: “While I was entering my office, I met students and told them not to waste time by protesting, and they should go back to their hostels. I will discuss the issues with them but not like this, and told them to call off their protest. They cannot pick and choose the fee structure and other issues. The Haryana government has its own budget and the Punjab government its own. Students cannot compare fee structures randomly. Then, salaries too should be compared. The Punjab government employees are getting better payscales than the employees of Haryana.”"

Besides Gadkari, several BJP and RSS members are part of the organizing and advisory committees of the conference.During the sit-in, activists raised anti-Kane slogans. They asked why the VC refused to meet them if there was nothing wrong in his decision. The blockade ended when cops escorted all the activists to the VC chamber where they submitted their demands.Tiwari accused Kane of helping BJP leaders in their political campaign ahead of the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections by using students’ money and University space. NYC also questioned Kane’s move to share stage with Manch’s president Kalpana Pande who is an accused in a 2015 bribery case. Tiwari said by neglecting science departments, it is evident the VC was under pressure from BJP-RSS organisations.After the VC refused to cancel the event, Tiwari said NYC would intensify its agitiation against “misuse” of university property. “If Yechury wasn’t allowed, why exception is made for the party in power? How can the VC share the dais with an accused. Kane must resign,” he said."

IESA members strongly feel that the government is ignoring smaller single branch schools while encouraging ‘corporate’ institutions to flourish.Nana Satpute, vice-president of IESA, said the current trend could be termed as ‘mall culture’ in education. “These big brand schools are opening up branches in every nook and corner, and thus finishing off stand-alone institutions that have served the community according to its needs,” said Satpute.He compared it with big malls that have forced closure of mom & pop shops which were integral part of the society. “In the smaller independent schools, there is a small ecosystem which represents the community. The school’s trustee or principal, teachers are usually from the same neighbourhood and know the parents well. The community connect is strong between independent schools and the people,” said Satpute.Rajendra Dayma, president of IESA, said, “Our schools need money to survive. We have been giving free admissions right from the start, but the state has not been honouring its side of the commitment. Independent schools require funds to continue being in existence.”Apart from financial threat, IESA says its members also face threat of episodic events. “Political party workers recently attacked a school and its staff in western Maharashtra. In fact, it continues to happen across the state on a regular basis. We want that School Safety Act be introduced that gives strong punishment to those who indulge in such activities,” said Dayma.Monday’s protest was the first step and IESA is preparing for the next show of strength.Dayma said, “We will now start a non-cooperation movement as soon as RTE admissions start. Let the state education department continue with the online applications,lotteryand allotment process. And when the list finally comes to us, we will simply not do anything.” Once a student is allotted a seat in a school, the principal gets a message in the online web portal. The principal has three options to click on against every seat allotted.“We can accept, reject (citing reasons) and say student has not approached the school. We won’t click on anything till our entire dues are cleared,” said Dayma."

The activists wore garlands of carrots as a symbol of protest against the unfulfilled promises of the civic body.The activists said that the AMC has failed to utilize the amount reserved for the disabled as per the Government Resolution (GR) of the state government for the last 6 years, despite several assurances.On January 16, the AMC general body meeting passed a resolution to utilize Rs10.5 crore from the (3% and 5%) funds reserved for disabled persons.The activists had expressed dissatisfaction over the poor allocation of money in the resolution. According to Shivaji Gade, the district chief of the Prahar Apang Sanghatna, the meagre Rs50 lakh allocation towards the grants for the disabled, restriction of benefits to those with more than 80% disability, lack of assurance on provision of housing scheme benefits and allocation of shopsto disabledpersons, were not acceptable to the disabled.On Monday, MLA Kadu, accompanied by his activists, stormed into the mayor’s chamber while raising slogans. Kadu held talks with mayor Nandkumar Ghodele and municipal corporation officials and presented his objections to the resolution. “The resolution is in contradiction to the government resolution and schemes,” said Kadu.Following the meeting, the civic body agreed to the several demands placed and mayor Ghodele gave the same in writing. The letter stated that the provision towards the disabled in the AMC budget will be increased from Rs50 lakh to Rs2 crore. According to the GR, those with 40 to 80% disability will be provided Rs2,000 per month and those with more than 80% disability will be provided Rs3,000 per month. The grants will be deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. A proposal will also be sent to the state government for reservation for the disabled in housing schemes and the AMC will hold talks and will take the necessary action on allotting shops to the disabled. The AMC will make the needed amendments in a resolution, during its general body meeting on February 28."

And his wife is in the fray for Congress ticket from Khajuraho seat.For Indore, minister for sports and youth affairs Jeetu Patwari still seems to be a popular option.A senior Congress leader said that Patwari is willing to contest but chief minister Kamal Nath has instructed that no sitting Congress MLA or minister will be fielded for Lok Sabha.Sources in the party office added that when Jeetu Patwari was denied possible candidature, he asked if his wife Renuka can be fielded.The other names in the panel for Indore are of Satyanarayan Patel, who has contested several times and lost against Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan, state Congress media cell chief and former Mahila Congress national chairperson Shobha Oza and Archana Jaiswal.For Gwalior, the most likely candidate to be fielded is Ashok Singh who contested against Union minister for rural developmentNarendra Singh Tomarin 2014 and was defeated by approximately 26,000 votes.Congress leaders argued that the margin of Tomar’s victory was not extraordinary despite the Modi-wave of the previous general elections.ForJabalpur, Rajya Sabha MP and eminent lawyer Vivek Tankha is heading the list, though former MLA Neelesh Awasthi, who lost the November assembly polls, is also being considered a good candidate opposite BJP state president Rakesh Singh.Home minister of the erstwhile Digvijaya Singh government, Mahendra Boudh is leading in the panel of candidates for Bhind constituency.Another former minister Rameshwar Neekhra is a prominent name in the list for Hoshangabad, together with former Union minister Suresh Pachauri and former minister of the BJP government who joined Congress in November Sartaj Singh.Former Youth Congress state president Meenakshi Natarajan is likely to be fielded fromMandsaurfor the third time, even though she lost the seat in the last general elections. PWD minister Sajjan Singh Verma’s son is a name in the list for Dewas, while stalwarts former deputy speaker Rajendra Singh and former leader of opposition Ajay Singh are both in the race for Satna constituency.The only sure names are that of sitting MPs Jyotiraditya Scindia for Guna and Kantilal Bhuria for Ratlam.Former Union minister Arun Yadav could get fielded from Khandwa, chief minister Kamal Nath’s son Nakul from Chhindwara, while Himadri Singh who lost the bypoll of Shahdol in November 2016 could again emerge as the party’s face for the tribal reserved seat.

Police also stopped angry protesters from entering the coaching centre to avoid any clashes between angry families and supporters of Malik.The coaching centre, set up by the Samiti from the money it had collected during the Jat quota stir, was being inaugurated by Malik in presence of other members of the Jat body. The celebratory environment suddenly changed when family members of youths who have been languishing in jail reached the spot.They started shouting outside the premises and alleged that Malik-led Samiti had siphoned funds collected as donation from the community in the name of fighting legal cases of these jailed youth. Sensing trouble, police reached the spot in huge number and surrounded the competitive coaching center acting as buffer between the groups. The high drama prevailed for about two hours with Malik and other members of Samiti sat inside the centre for the protesters to leave.Talking to media, Malik blamed the state government for stage managing the protest to spoil their inauguration ceremony. “Samiti has already helped those who are facing legal cases in Jat quota stir and there is no opposition from them. Those who protested today are those whose children are facing legal cases due to complaint of finance minister CaptAbhimanyufor vandalising and looting his house inRohtak,” he alleged.Additional SP Anshu Singla told media that they got information about chaos at the ceremony and police personnel were rushed to the spot to quell the situation. There has been no complaint from either side, he added."

K Ansalan MLA will inaugurate the dharna at 10.30am.Kazhakkoottam-Karode bypass action council patron and former MLA Jameela Prakasham said that the NHAI was doing injustice by denying reasonable compensation for the land owners in villages such as Kottukal, Kanjiramkulam, Thirupuram, Chenkal and Karode.Prakasham said that majority of land owners didn’t receive compensation by the end of 2014, which makes them eligible for compensation under first schedule of the new land acquisition act. The action council has also alleged that the NHAI was harassing them by filing case in high court against the arbitration awarded by district collector. The action council had demanded NHAI to revoke cases filed against them immediately.According to action council chairman V Sudhakaran, the issues began when district administration backtracked from the compensation agreed during the district level purchase committee (DLPC) meeting in 2013. The meeting had announced Rs 5.25 lakh per cent for A category land. Owners of B, C, D and E categories were to get 10% lesser amounts. Though the amount was agreed for Kottukal, Kanjiramkulam and Thirupuram villages, the DLPC didn’t offer similar rates for lands in Chenkal and Karode, which resulted in a tussle between the then district collector and action council. Former district collector K N Satheesh then cancelled the DLPC and arbitrarily fixed the compensation. Following this, A category land owners got only Rs 3.75 lakh.District collector was appointed as an arbitrator when the land owners launched a protest in 2017. Former district collector S Venkatesapathi had announced 15% hike for 165 complainants and district collector K Vasuki announced 50% hike. However, NHAI has filed appeal against this."

They discussed the provisions of PLPA, formed a human chain, marched and shouted slogans like “Clean air and water is my right”, “NoAravali, no vote”, “Builder-neta nexus, Hai hai!” and “Stop PLPA amendment”.Environmentalists expressed concern over theBillnot being shared with public or the forest department. Environmental analyst Chetan Agarwal, said, “The proposed amendments are effectively a repeal of PLPA. They seek blanket provisions that exclude PLPA from being applicable to urban areas, and gives the government power to unilaterally restrict its application to any area it wishes. The amendments are sought to be made with retrospective effect from 1966, thereby nullifying protections made under the Act since then. They subvert Supreme Court directives to protect the Aravalis at any cost, and to treat PLPA areas as forests. Instead, the entire Aravalis will be open for real estate development, mining and any other activity the state fancies.”“The language of the draft Bill contradicts chief minister Khattar’s promise to protect Aravalis. We hope the government will examine implications of the amendments, consult experts and citizens within and outside government, on how they also affect forested hills of the Shivaliks around Chandigarh and Aravalis in south Haryana. The 119-year-old Act has served us well. What’s the hurry to amend it without examination and review,” asked Lt Col (retired) Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi, a legal expert and environmentalist.Ecologist Vijay Dhasmana said, “Aravalis act as green lungs for theNCR. They are also critical for recharging groundwater, which is depleting at the rate of 5ft per year in Gurgaon alone.Groundwaterextraction in this region is 300% more than recharge.”Environmentalists said the protest will be held every week, till the government takes back the Bill. Jitender Bhadana of NGO Save Aravali, said, “We’ll carry on the protest online andoffline. This is one of this region’s most crucial issues. There is a need to spread awareness among people, so that everyone can come together, as destruction of the Aravalis is irreversible, and will impact all of us.”The Haryana government is going to table the Bill in the legislative assembly next week. If it’s passed, it will give a nod to construction activity on thousands of acres that are currently protected as forest land under PLPA. On February 15, TOI was the first to report that the Cabinet has approved the amendment Bill.According to the amendment, Punjab Land Preservation (Haryana Amendment) Act, 2019, areas included under any development plan and under jurisdiction of municipal acts, will be out of PLPA’s ambit. Also, land that is part of any infrastructure like railway, roads, canals, public institutions, government or public establishments, will also be out of PLAP’s purview.The amendment will destroy over 60,000 acres of forests, which is 50% of Aravalis in Haryana, over districts of Gurgaon, Faridabad, Nuh, Mahendergarh and Rewari. In south Haryana, Aravalis are estimated to cover about 1,25,000 acre.As all of Gurgaon and Faridabad fall under master plans, both cities will lose 100% forests to real estate. About 16,000 acre of forest in Gurgaon and over 10,000 acre in Faridabad will open up for construction.The Aravalis is home to south Haryana’s last remaining forests, and an important shield against desertification of Delhi/NCR. It is home to over 400 native tree, shrub and herb species, eight forest ecosystems, over 200 native and migratory bird species, wild animals such as leopards, hyenas, jackals, nilgais, mongoose, civet cats, reptiles and insects."

Apart from other MLAs, labour minister Gopal Rai also spoke on the issue strongly advocating the status of a full statehood for Delhi-.Participating in the discussion, Leader of the Opposition, Vijender Gupta, questioned the timing of the resolution arguing that in the current term, the Parliament had its last sitting early this month.“The demand for a full statehood at this juncture is a political stunt. Whenever AAP finds itself in political danger, it raises the demand for statehood,” Gupta said. “There will not be any session of the Parliament before the election now. For what purpose is the Kejriwal government seeking the statehood at this juncture? The Supreme Court has also commented that Delhi cannot be granted statehood.”The resolution questioned how a politically nominated lieutenant governor could act as a “super-boss” of a democratically elected council of ministers in Delhi. “Elected representatives are directly accountable to the voters and are rightly questioned on issues affecting their daily lives,” the resolution read.The resolution also pointed out that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on home affairs, headed by the then chairman Pranab Mukherjee, in its 106th report in December 2003 had strongly endorsed the Bill for Statehood for Delhi, but it lapsed as the Lok Sabha dissolved a few months later and no attempt was made to revive it."

People from the affluent class of society live in this locality. The land cost here is very high and it makes no sense to set up an EWSHousingScheme in such a locality. We have taken up the issue with the AMC in the past who had assured not to set up such a scheme. However, the work for the scheme has suddenly begun and thus, we have decided to protest.""Residents believe setting up of EWS Housing Scheme for lower income groups would only dent the 'reputation' of the area. ""The average cost of land in this area is Rs 1.5 lakh per square yard. The civic body should instead sell the land plot and set up EWS Housing Scheme in some other area, which is financially more viable for them,"" said Piyush Thakkar, secretary of the association. ""Our association members have represented the issue before the municipal commissioner as well as the mayor of Ahmedabad.""Residents will hold a rally at 8.30pm from Green Meadows Crossroads to Shukan Mall Crossroads.

It was among many rallies and marches planned around Paris and in other cities.Five separate demonstrations were organized in the French capital.Support for the movement has ebbed in recent weeks as it has splintered and outbreaks of violence continue. Online announcements for Saturday's marches appealed for peaceful action, and one of the weekend protests aimed to stand up against anti-Semitism.The extremist views of some protesters erupted in a torrent of anti-Semitic insults hurled at noted philosopher Alain Finkielkraut on the sidelines of last weekend's Paris protest. The assault came days after the French government reported a huge rise in incidents of anti-Semitism last year.A few hundred yellow vest protesters made the most of the sunny weather to gather at the Chambord Castle in central France for a picnic while activists reportedly blocked access to an Amazon platform in the southwestern city of Toulouse.Local authorities inClermont-Ferrandurged citizens to postpone their journeys to the central French city, where hundreds of yellow vest protesters gathered. The prefecture said police arrested 13 people _ including seven who were placed in custody _ and seized weapons including baseball bats and alarm pistols.The yellow vest movement was named after the fluorescent garments French motorists must carry in their vehicles for emergencies. The protests started in November to oppose fuel tax hikes but have expanded into a broader public rejection of French presidentEmmanuel Macron's economic policies, which protesters say favor businesses and the wealthy over ordinary French workers."

The BSL management is intentionally doing this to ignore us,” Jafar said.Members of BMKAS have been frequently staging demonstrations. Earlier in January, several demonstrators were detained and taken to Camp Jail at Mangalam Stadium. They were later released with assurance of negotiations with BSL management.

Five years down the line, another Supreme Court order has now raised their concern.As the Niyamgiri tribals get ready to celebrate their two-day annual Niyam Raja Parba, their biggest festival, the mood is rather sombre. Many apprehend they might lose their ancestral homes in the wake of the February 13 Supreme Court ruling which has ordered eviction of more than 11 lakh tribals across the country whose land rights have not been settled by the state governments. The Dongria Kondhs are planning to hold rallies in their region against the apex court order, for which they blame the governments at the Centre and the state.Lingaraj Azad, convenor of Niyamgiri Surakhya Samiti, an outfit fighting for the protection of tribal rights, said if the order is implemented, hundreds of tribals living in the forest land for generations will have to vacate their native place. “After the Niyam Raja Parba ends on Sunday, we intend to start an agitation to press for our rights,” Azad said. He said the central and state governments are to blame for the Supreme Court verdict. “While the state failed to give us the land rights, the Centre did not represent the case properly,” he claimed.The SC has asked states to file their affidavits by July 12 regarding the eviction of those whose applications for land rights under the Forest Rights Act have been rejected. More than 5,000 people from 112 villages have been residing in and around Niyamgiri hills. Official data shows that out of 590 claims over forest rights, only 310 have been considered.Lado Sikoka, president of Niyamgiri Surakhya Samiti said the state government deliberately rejected many claims. “Where will these tribals live if the government evicts them?” Sikoka asked.Sidhartha Nayak, a Bhawanipatna-based lawyer, who has been fighting for the rights of forest dwellers, said the state government lacks sincerity in settling tribal rights under the Forest Rights Act. “The government offered just 10 decimal land to tribals who have been cultivating more than one acre of land. So, many of them didn’t accept the pattas (land records), resulting in rejection of their claims,” the lawyer said.Dillip Kumar Das, who heads an NGO, Antodaya, that works on land rights, said they are planning to file a review petition. T Ashok Kumar, divisional forest officer (south) of Kalahandi, assured that they would review the claims within three months so that those eligible are not left out."

Regarding the final aspect of our demands like loan waiver and pensions to farmers, the ministers are checking with the statefinancedepartment. Hence, it is taking some time,” Ajit Navle, AIKS state secretary, said.He claimed that the two ministers have assured that a written draft would be given to them later in the night that would spell out state government’s stand on each of the demands raised by the AIKS. “After we receive the draft we will have a meeting with the farmers to seek their opinion,” Navle said.According to him, the AIKS leaders would decide whether to resume the march after discussing the written assurances that the state government gives.On Wednesday too Mahajan had a meeting with the AIKS leaders for around two-and-a-half hours. The long march was supposed to start from Nashik at about 6pm on Wednesday.

The minister, though, verbally promised the AIKS leaders to resolves all their issues.Mahajan, on Wednesday, had assured the AIKS leaders that he would revert to them after holding discussions with chief ministerDevendra Fadnavis."

The farmers from various parts of the state were protesting against the banks for acting against them in cheque bounce cases.“We have been sitting on a protest in Ludhiana for the past several days in support of our demands. Around 1,000 cheque bounce cases were prepared by the authorities, and about 350 farmers of the state were issued arrest warrants in such cases, with some also being jailed. Banks have taken blank cheques from farmers, and when such a cheque bounces, a farmer has to face legal action because he is unable to pay the loan,” said Sudagar Singh, leader of Bhartiya Kissan Union (BKU) Ekta Ugrahan, who belongs to Ghudani village in Payal.“Yesterday at around 5pm, we had a meeting with cooperative and jails minister Sukhjinder Randhawa. Talks broke down after we stood by the demand that the government should not trouble farmers with less than ten acres of land who had a debt of Rs10 lakh, but they (government) stuck to their position, saying they would only waive off those farmer’s debt of Rs10 lakh who had land of five acres or less. After the talks ran into rough weather, we decided to stage a protest sit-in near the Zonal Office of Punjab National Bank (PNB) from 1pm to 4pm.”The farmer groups said 7,000 farmers from across the state participated in the protest march and sit-in. They added that farmer organizations that participated in the Thursday’s protest included BKU Ekta Ugrahan, BKU Krantikari, BKU Ekta Dakunda, Kissan Sangharsh Committee (Azad), Kissan Sangharsh Committee (Punjab), and two others farmer groups.“Authorities got directions from the court that we cannot assemble within 100 metres near the bank. As our demands have not been met, we rallied around 250m from the bank, but if the authorities don’t concede to our demands, we will go up to about 105 or 110m distance from the zonal branch of the bank,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of BKU Ekta Dakunda. He added: “Tomorrow, the hearing of the case is in the high court, and we will plead our case there as well.”Meanwhile, as farmer organizations blocked the ever-busy road, commuters had to face a lot of problems. The worst sufferers were those going towards Jagraon and Mullanpur Dakha, who did not have prior information about the blockade. “Even as the authorities had diverted traffic to Pakhowal Road and Hambran Road, it was quite a bad scenario for commuters because of the chaos. It took us an hour-and-a-half to reach Mullanpur, as after getting stuck in traffic on Ferozepur Road, we took the Pakhowal Road, but that too was choked for some time,” said Manjeet Singh, a city resident."

A second arrest was made on a highway north of Barcelona where protesters threw objects at a line of riot police.Seven officers also received minor injuries when protesters threw rocks at them on another road, according to police. Protesters elsewhere burned tires on some highways.Regional transportation authorities said the disruptions affected main thoroughfares in Barcelona and half a dozen major highways and railway tracks elsewhere in Catalonia.Thegeneral strikewas organized by small unions of pro-independence workers and students. On paper, they were demanding improved social policies including a 35-hour work week and a higher minimum wage, but the protesters carried pro-secession flags and chanted slogans for the release of the 12 separatists currently on trial in the Madrid-based Supreme Court.The main unions in Catalonia did not back the strike, which appeared to have a limited impact on businesses.In Barcelona, students in favor of secession held a march. The pro-secession grassroots group ANC — whose protest slogan is ""self-determination is not a crime"" — was planning a separate march later Thursday.The Spanish government says regions cannot independently secede, according to the Constitution.The trial into the roles played by the 12 separatists in Catalonia's failed 2017 secession attempt is in its second week. On Thursday, former Catalan government member Santi Vila, ANC's ex-president Jordi Sanchez and fellow activistJordi Cuixartwere scheduled to testify at the court. The trial is expected to last at least three months.Election results and polls indicate that Catalonia's 7.5 million residents are divided down the middle over the secession issue."

Friday’s incident in Salt Lake came barely 25 hours after a senior citizen lost an arm after being hit by a speeding bus near Bagha Jatin, at the other end of the city, onThursday afternoon.The conductor of the bus, which cops are trying to track down, initially tried to push Disha Malkhandi and her friends inside the crowded bus, prompting them to protest. The conductor, enraged by Malkhandi’s objections, then pushed her out, causing her to fall face first on the road near CAP Island in Salt Lake.The fall broke her glasses and pierced the skin millimetres from her eyes and the rear wheels of the bus ran over her left foot as she tried to roll out of harm’s way.One of Malkhandi’s friends, Nibedita Banerjee, shouted out, telling the driver to stop the bus. But, as it continued to move, she jumped off the vehicle as it sped away. The other friend, Priyanka, got off at the next stop and ran back.Cops, till late on Friday evening, were yet to track down the bus. “We are waiting for CCTV footage from the area and a formal complaint,” an officer of the traffic wing ofBidhannagarPolice said.Malkhandi and two of her friends boarded the bus on route 215A from Sector V a little after 2.30pm on Friday.“The bus was extremely crowded and there was barely place to stand on the footboard. But the conductor kept urging us to go deeper inside. My friend protested when the conductor kept pushing us,” Banerjee later said.“She fell off the bus and, by the time I got off the moving vehicle, blood was oozing out of her left foot,” she added.Malkhandi’s friends pleaded with a rickshaw puller who eventually agreed to take the injured girl to Bidhannagar Sub-Divisional Hospital. A doctor gave her first-aid and bandaged her almost-severed toe with the rest of the foot before referring her to SSKM Hospital. She underwent a surgery there later in the evening.“The big toe was hanging by a vein and there was a lot of blood loss. We applied pressure to bandage the toe with the foot and referred her to a city hospital as she needed specialized attention and an immediate surgery,” a doctor at the Salt Lake hospital said.Doctors at SSKM Hospital told TOI that the toe was not in a position to be salvaged. “The crushed big toe had no muscular support and was attached to the rest of the foot only by a tendon. We have treated the wound and will observe it for the next 48 hours and then do a second surgery to remove the dead tissue. But the toe cannot be salvaged. We will have to conduct plastic surgery on the wounded part,” said plastic surgeon Sandeep Basu.The first-year student of a private varsity in Sector V is a resident of Dasghara, near Tarakeshwar in Hooghly, and stays as a paying guest at Salt Lake’s CG Block."

Chandana was reportedly annoyed of executive engineer Jagdish Prasad Meena who on February 13 ordered lineman Mukesh Saini to join his duty after minister Ashok Chandana during a public hearing in the area on February 5 ordered for his suspension on receipt of complaint against him.Meanwhile, speaking to TOI , executive engineer J.P. Meena alleged the sports minister hatched a conspiracy to attack him. “Had the SE and other engineers had not intervened to defend me, the minister would have taken my life,” J P Meena said. Only the four engineers with him including the SE were eyewitness to the incident, he said.But the state minister for sports Ashok Chandana in a statement refuting allegations of assault on the engineer accepted that he did speak harsh words to him and slammed him for revoking suspension of the linesman without any inquiry.“The linesman was suspended following complaints by the villagers. But within ten days he was reinstated without conducting an enquiry.” He said he would not tolerate injustice to the people who had elected him as their representative with thumping majority.

The protest had started in the wake of state’s failure to keep their word even after repeated assurances. “We have been given assurances after assurances for the last two years but nothing concrete has come out from government’s side. We are not asking the government to approve the demands overnight, we are just requesting government to issue a notification in this regard even if the demands are fulfilled later,” Shambhu Yadav, vice-president of JPA, said.The seven point demand include filling of 1,150 vacant posts of sub-inspector and inspector ranks by giving promotion to havaldars and sipahis, to pay an extra month of salary on the lines of other states, revision of salary as per seventh pay commission recommendations, relaxation in age limit to the dependent or next of kin for compensatory jobs, to implement the old pension scheme instead of the new, to provide medical facilities to personnel on the lines of officers and to implement modified assured career progression as per the seventh pay commission which provides monetary benefits to personnel if their promotion is delayed."

They claimed sportspersons were not getting uniforms even though the academic year was coming to an end.Former director of sports and physical education Kalpana Jadhav, who was accused of irregularity in the purchases, used the protest to claim that no students had protested earlier since they had got their uniforms in time when she was in charge.Jadhav said, “Why is the ABVP raising the issue now if they themselves claim that sports gear was not provided to teams for last couple of years? This means teams were getting the required blazers and tracksuits on time even though NU didn’t approve the department proposals on time.”Vice chancellor SP Kane had relieved Jadhav of the charge of director after allegations of malpractices in purchase of sport gear were levelled against her in December.Atmaram Pande, who replaced Jadhav, admitted that proposals to purchase new gear were pending for the last couple of years. “Proposals are gradually being cleared by the purchase committee, and soon all students will receive blazers,” he said.Jadhav said the fact that students are complaining now proves that no purchases were made. “Being from sports fraternity, some vendors had provided blazers and tracksuit due to my goodwill. The purchase committee takes a long time to approve our proposal, but the teams can’t wait. Competitions are lined up and teams have to leave on time. I had taken the stock on credit, but this was given a completely different angle,” she said.It had been alleged that Jadhav purchased sports gear worth Rs 5.70lakh first and then floated tenders, which were eventually awarded to the vendor who supplied the stock. The quality of tracksuits and blazers too was allegedly substandard.Jadhav said she had taken over charge at a very crucial phase, after the post had been lying vacant for almost a year. “There was a huge backlog, yet I ran the show smoothly for 20 months from March 2017 to December 2019. No students complained,” she said.VC Kane told reporters on Wednesday that he had appointed Jadhav to ensure all formalities were completed, and at least 100 sets were ready for teams in the department. “A full-time director would be appointed soon, and he will be asked to keep the stock ready,” he said."

Sanction was given for constructing twobreakwaterstructures measuring 220m at a cost of Rs 23.50 crore.The project is being shelved owing to local protests. In 2018, harbour engineering department had awarded tenders and signed an agreement, however the contractor could never start work.“The residents raised concerns that northern shore of Veli would erode and that waste from Veli-Akkulam would directly reach sea and affect livelihood of coastal population. Around 5,000 residents had protested against the project,” an official of harbour engineering department said.He added that the project was key to prevent waterlogging in East Fort and Thampanoor and that it could have helped in elimination of weeds in the backwaters.District collector had held a meeting in 2017 to resolve the issue but a consensus could not be reached.The land was handed over to the contractor but with work being delayed for more than six months, the contractor communicated to the officials that he may be relieved of the works.In case of further delay, the department also faced the chance of dealing with arbitration for violation of contract. The department was forced to cancel the agreement and now government has cancelled the administrative sanction indicating that project has been dropped.The project was first approved in 2009. In May 2015, the then district collector and chief secretary had stressed on revamping the breakwater project at Veli so that the water flowing along the widened drains as part of Operation Anantha could be directed towards Veli without any hitch.The project that had been shelved for years was revived anticipating high tide during monsoon. Water from three canals Ulloor, Pattom and Amayizhanjan converge at Kannamoola and is discharged into Veli backwaters through Akkulam.Sandbars are formed naturally between the backwaters and the sea and in case of high tide, water is forced back and it surges in the reverse direction and usually sandbars are manually broken at Veli and Poonthura to control the tide.The project prepared by harbour engineering department had suggested formation of an artificial breakwater chain that would prevent deposit of sand and formation of sandbars. However the project was never considered for implementation even when Thampanoor, East Fort and Kannamoola flooded during heavy rain.In 2009, the tender was awarded and agreement was signed however lack of environmental clearance for the project led to the project being put off.The Veli breakwater project was conceived by the Harbour engineering department in 2009 at a cost of Rs 12 crore. In 2015 a revised estimate was prepared at Rs 25 crore."

By then, police had taken statements from the injured and arrested the MLA’s driver, Akash.“I tried to convince the crowd saying it was me who was driving the SUV at the time of accident. The cars were parked without parking lights on. That’s why the accident took place. There was mist and I was driving on the left lane of the road.

And forest minister Umang Singhar said there were no financial irregularities in the planting of saplings along Narmada’s banks, practically a clean chit to Chouhan’s government.Congress had attackedBJPrelentlessly on both issues during campaign for the assembly polls. After the about-turn, BJP hit out at Congress for “misguiding the state for political gain”.CM Kamal Nath on Tuesday stepped in to try and save face. Sources in Congress told TOI Bachchan and Singhar will have to clarify their stand before party chief Rahul Gandhi. Nath made it clear his government has “resolved to ensure punishment to those involved in corruption and scams”. “We will neither spare those who shot farmers in Mandsaur, nor relieve those involved in the Narmada planting scam. We will also not spare those responsible for financial fraud during Simhastha… we have resolved to see this through,” he tweeted.Congress veteranDigvijaya Singhwas scathing in his criticism of Singhar and Bachchan. “It is surprising the home and forest ministers gave a sort of clean chit to the previous BJP government. The home minister in his reply justified police firing on farmers, which is not acceptable to us. The forest minister replied there was no corruption in mass tree plant drive on Narmada’s banks. I walked 3,100km along the riverbank, how much has he walked? There was big corruption. What was the need for the forest minister to defend BJP?” asked Digvijaya.Reacting to Congress’s self-goals, state BJP accused ministers of lying, saying no matter what the ministers say now, their statements in the assembly would be considered official. “The ministers had spoken the truth in the House on both the Narmada drive and Mandsaur firing.

The order issued by the university's registrar on Tuesday said she was rusticated for causing “indiscipline at the campus”. Police said they had received a complaint but there were “insufficient grounds” to file an FIR against her.“We received a memorandum from students of the university on February 19 regarding an anti-national post circulated on social media,” the letter reads, quoting the name and enrolment number of the student. “The university shall not tolerate such type of indiscipline on campus. Hence, it has been decided that the student has been rusticated with immediate effect.”It all began with the girl uploading a story on Instagram on Monday night. She had purportedly shared a screen-grab of a Facebook post of another person — not a resident of Gurugram — who spoke of the use of pellet guns on demonstrators, and alleged differential treatment being meted out to people inKashmir. There was an immediate backlash, in response to which she released a follow-up post, alleging atrocities on Kashmiris.This post triggered fury among her fellow students, who immediately decided to put together a response. At 9am on Tuesday, around 1,000 students marched on campus with a poster of the girl. “It was a peaceful demonstration,” said Mandeep Dagar, an MBA second- year student and one of the organisers of the rally. “The post was uploaded on Monday night on Instagram and WhatsApp. Her classmates saw the posts and took screen grabs,” he said.Protesting students claimed the screenshots made it to WhatsApp groups of various university departments. “They went viral across the campus. By morning, everyone decided to hold a rally to protest disrespect to soldiers,” said Sagar Gahlot, a BBA student. “Her posters were also burnt.”Students said the girl did not attend college in the morning. “When we finally assembled here, we could not see her,” said Praveen Kataria, who is pursuing LLB. “She had already got a whiff of impending protest against her, and the administration had made arrangements for her to leave.”The public relations officer (PRO) of SGT University confirmed to TOI that anti-Pakistan protests took place on the campus. “The agitation was peaceful. They demanded the student be rusticated. Following the complaints, the university formed a five-member committee which assessed the social media posts and decided to rusticate her. We informed her guardians who took the girl from her hostel and left,” the official said. Asked if the university will file an FIR against her, the official said, “No, we won’t. We have taken necessary action following the university regulations.”A police officer at Rajendra Park police station told TOI no FIR was registered against the student. “The evidence against her is not firm enough to merit a case of sedition,” he said. “The posts were not sent to anyone. She was sharing it on her profile. In the same complaint, students spoke of another Kashmiri student who had apparently intimidated other students. We’re investigating that too. We’ll check call records also during the investigation.”"

Neither does the tribunal have the jurisdiction to approve that a party has been dissolved. It comes under the purview of the Election Commission. The speaker’s judgement was undemocratic and he has lost the moral right to be in his chair,” Tirkey said.Oraon on Wednesday rejected the petition seeking disqualification of six JVM-P MLAs on grounds of defection under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution and validated the merger of the Babulal Marandi-led party withBJP.Alleging that the tribunal had taken an unilateral decision, Tirkey said the party constitution provisions that a merger will happen after consent of the two-third majority of its central committee. “Only two central committee members of our party appeared in the hearings,” he added.Tirkey also added that the EC, while replying to a RTI query in 2016, had stated that it did not receive any proposal on behalf of the JVM-P for a merger with BJP. “The party contested in several bypolls since 2015 and each time, its candidate were given the party’s symbol, the comb. This proves that the party did not merge with BJP. In fact, JVM-P never merged with any party since its inception in 2006,” Tirkey added.When asked about the future of JVM-P’s sitting MLAs Pradeep Yadav and Prakash Ram in the assembly, party advocate R N Sahay said the Constitution provisions that such legislators will not be disqualified.Meanwhile, JVM-P workers burnt effigies of six defected MLAs, chief minister Raghubar Das and speaker Oraon at Albert Ekka Chowk on Wednesday afternoon.BJP had won 37 seats in the 81-memberassemblywhile its ally Ajsu Party party had won five in 2014 state polls.

The protest was held after the terrorist attack inPulwama, Jammu & Kashmir, where 44 CRPF soldiers lost their lives.Ashok Dubey, a top officer bearer at the FWICE, says, “I don’t want to go into the past. We have now sent a note to all producers and music companies, sternly telling them to refrain from employing any talent from Pakistan. We have had enough of this. Any composer or artiste, who comes from there, will not be entertained here from this day onwards.” Explaining the severity of the ban, Dubey informs, “No film or TV unit can function without the members of the FWICE. It’s our people who construct the set, serve food and beverages and work as technicians and junior artistes. Out of 200 people on a set, 80 per cent are affliliated with our associations and they are with me when I say that we will not work with any show, film or anything such that employs Pakistani artistes. This has to stop.”Ashoke Pandit, the President of IFTDA, asserts, “Nothing comes before the men who have lost their lives and those men who continue to guard our boundaries and keep us safe. I am strictly against those who say that art has no boundaries and we shouldn’t bring all this in the exchange of art. The fact of the matter is that, no Pakistani artiste even after so many days, has condemned the Pulwama attack. No Pakistani has taken up for India. Why should India employ these artistes who don’t think they need to stand up for a country that has given them work and recognition? Yes, there have been many bans in the past, which were called upon by individual bodies like the producers’ body or a particular technical body. This time, the ban has been imposed by the mother of all organisations that covers all the technical departments employed in filmmaking. This time, no filmmaker, composer or music label can escape it. And no one will employ Pakistani talent. Our doors are closed for them.”Work at Film City was brought to a halt for over two hours on Sunday and a decision to issue a non-cooperation directive against any producer who employs Pakistani talent was mutually made and agreed upon. Recently, cricketer-turned-politicianNavjot Singh Sidhuwas also banned from appearing onThe Kapil Sharma Show, following his comments on the reactions to the Pulwama attack. Explaining this further, Dubey says, “We have even warned the makers of Kapil Sharma’s show that Navjot Singh Sidhu, after making those remarks, will not be allowed inside Film City premises, or any other studio in Mumbai. He must remember we won’t forgive or forget his comment.”"

And forest minister Umang Singhar said there were no financial irregularities in the plantation drive conducted along the Narmada banks.Congress had attacked BJP relentlessly on both these issues during campaign for assembly polls. After the about-turn on Monday, BJP demanded a public apology.Bachchan gave the Mandsaur statement in reply to queries raised by Congress MLA Harsh Vijay Gahlot. ""On June 6, 2017, police firing at Bahi Chaupati on Mhow-Neemuch Road in the absence of executive magistrate, was done by complying to SOP for self-defence. It was to protect government and private property. The order was given by SDM Malhargarh, Sharavan Bhandari in Pipliya Mandi,"" read his statement.On government action on the Justice Jain report, Bachchan said, ""The report is being reviewed and appropriate legal action will be taken after examining the findings."" The Jain report had mentioned ""communication gap"" between farmers and officials. ""The administration wasn't aware of their demands and did not make any effort to find out. But, the district administration wasn't in a position to address demands that farmers should get better prices or a loan waiver. Thus, police firing on June 6 was necessary and legal,"" the report said.Even after coming to power in the state, Congress minister Jitu Patwari, who had accompanied AICC chiefRahul Gandhiduring his Mandsaur visit in June 2018, said, ""Those who fired at the farmers in Mandsaur shouldn't be spared."" Patwari had also tweeted on December 25, 2018, that the Congress government will ""reopen the Mandsaur investigation"".After the U-turn, BJP hit out at Congress. ""It was Congress's planned propaganda to attack BJP over the farmer issue. They misguided farmers and the entire country during assembly elections,"" said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.It was a repeat of this with the Narmada plantation. Congress had all along alleged that there were irregularities in the plantation drive, but minister Singhar said in the House on Monday: ""The state government has not found any irregularity or misappropriation of funds during the plantation drive on the banks of holy river Narmada. The department has issued instructions to examine the condition of saplings planted on July 2, 2017. There is no question of investigating the matter.""In July 2017, when the thenShivrajregime said it had planted 6 crore saplings along the Narmada, Congress smelt a ""scam"". ""It's a big scam in the name of Narmada. It's not only the question of planting 6 crore saplings, but also how much expenditure was incurred on it?"" Congress presidentKamal Nathhad asked in May 2018. Now, HIS minister has given it the clean chit.BJP launched a scathing attack on Congress for ""misguiding people"". ""Now, the forest minister admitted that there was no financial irregularity or misappropriation. Congress must apologize in public for its fake propaganda against BJP,"" said Agrawal."

The police questioned the house owner Anees and his family members.“They, however, apprised us that the flag atop their house was an Islamic flag which they had unfurled on the occasion of Barawafat recently. After a closer look at the green flag, which many villagers mistook as Pakistan’s, we found that it was a religious flag,” said station house officer Sachendi Raghvendra Singh.The police for time being removed the flag. “Anees said that they had purchased the flag from a local market area for installing on Barawafat,” the police said further.A police official further said, “National flag of Pakistan bears a white vertical bar at the left, the green portion bearing a white crescent in the centre and a five-pointed white star, wherein the flag hoisted at the house was green coloured with juts a crescent and star, which is mostly unfurled by Muslim community during any religious festival.”“Neither an FIR has been lodged nor anyone has been arrested or detained in this connection,” said the SHO."

However, the farmers refused a ‘closed door’ meeting and decided to continue with their protest. Theprotestin front of the Authority office hindered traffic movement and office work.Sukhveer Pehalwan, a farmer leader and resident of Sarfabad village, said that the farmers demand increased compensation. “Noida Authority had acquired our land for different projects. The farmers were given compensation and 5% land at relocated site. Later in 2012, a group of farmers moved to demanding increased compensation. The court directed Noida Authority to pay 64.7% additional compensation and 10% land. Noida Authority gave increased compensation to some farmers whose land were acquired. However, a large number of farmers have been waiting for the increased compensation and land as per court directions,” he said.The Authority has also notified some villages for land acquisition in future. Rajendra Yadav, another protester, said that Noida has issued notices to several farm owners against construction on the earmark land. “The farmers do not want to give land. We demand the Noida Authority to take back its notices,” he said. Sources said that only the petitioners who had moved to court were given increased compensation. The farmers also demanded the Authority to develop a sports complex and a government degree college at the proposed waste to energy site in Sector 123. Noida had to postpone that project following massive protest by local residents in June last year. Rajesh Kumar Singh, OSD Noida Authority, said that the farmers have refused a deliberation on the issue. “There are some demands which could be addressed at the government level. We are trying to resolve the issue,” he said.For the last seven days, the farmers gather on the spot with drums and loudspeakers and disperse in the evening. Pehalwan said that the protesters would again gather on Tuesday and lock Authority’s main gate if their demands were not met."

As per the Act, if any student is found violating the ordinance, he/she can be expelled, rusticated, asked to pay a fine or debarred from taking examinations.At DU, students usually protest at the conference centre, which houses the office of the dean (students’ welfare) and admission department. The other area is Arts Faculty. In the past, students have demonstrated in the library demanding better facilities.Students’ groups have opposed the circular stating that their right to protest is being curtailed.DUSU presidentShakti Singh said such notices are curtailment of their freedom of speech and expression. “The university is a democratic space and everyone has a right to raise their voice. Students have the right to choose the place of protest so that their voices reach the university administration.

How can they tell us not to do so? This is an autocratic rule and we will protest against it,” said Harish Gautam of KYS."

Many were furious not just with Pakistan, but with Britain, for not doing enough to stop Pakistan’s terrorism, given the close ties UK and India share.Asking Britain to stop “any military cooperation or aid with Pakistan,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s former communications director Manoj Ladwa said, “British companies who are making billions in Bharat also are seeking to make money in Pakistan. They must be clear you cannot have it both ways. Some politicians in the UK at the top of British politics have sympathy for terrorists, so a message must go out very clearly that phrases like ‘Indian administered Kashmir’ are not acceptable. Jammu andKashmiris and always will remain an integral part of Bharat.”UK-based Manu Khajuria (41), a Dogra from Kashmir, said she was furious that on February 4 and 5 the UK government had allowed Pakistan to host a conference and exhibition on Kashmir here. “We have to stand against terrorism. They have already made all the Kashmiri Hindus leave. This is not Azadi, this is Islamic jihadism. The Abdullah family is nurturing separatists and allowing the radicalisation of the youth. One of the soldiers killed was a Muslim, this is not a Hindu-Muslim thing. This is radicalisation from Pakistan and it is only going to get worse,” she said.The Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP) UK, Voice of Dogra and Kashmiri Pandits, were among the groups that participated. OFBJP UK vice president Dr Anand Arya said: “The leader of the group responsible for this terrorist attack is roaming round freely in Pakistan and still no action has been taken against him. Pakistan was defeated three times in open wars which is why they resort to using non-state actors to bleed India. India is not cowardly, and I am sure the Indian government will take punitive action. The UK is not doing enough. We want Britain to compel Pakistan to stop its terrorist activities.”"

If the foundation cannot handle the gaushala, then it should leave the work but they are worried about the donation that they receive in the name ofcowservice. This is cruelty towards the cows.”Chief executive officerof JMC, V P Singh, immediately suspended two officials of JMC animal husbandry department and a team was sent to Hingonia gaushala for rehabilitation.Manager of Hingonia gaushala, Radhey Priya Das, however refuted the claims of cows dying because of fodder scarcity.“Teams of JMC, CMO and animal husbandry department visited the gaushala for inspection and left satisfied with our work. Everyday around 70 cows die in the gaushala as many cows are brought here in old and poor condition. This is true that JMC haven’t cleared our bills for past five months of Rs 12 crore but we have been providing fodder to the cows anyhow. This is a planned story by the former chairman of Hingonia gaushala Bhagwant Singh Deval, who is not happy that we are managing the place after he was removed. ”Sri Krishna Balram Seva Trust (SKBT) entered into an agreement with the JMC for daily management of cattle rehabilitation after mass death was witnessed. The trust has also highlighted problem of inadequate staff in maintaining the shelter with large population of cows. The foundation requires approximately 2,500 metric tonne per month worth Rs 1 crore to feed these cattle at the cow shelter.

The report, which was not made public by the Punjab government for the last 32 years, says then SP (operations) did not seek mandatory permission from the district magistrate, sitting hardly at a distance of 1 kilometer, before resorting to firing at the mob.The commission had completed the probe into the February 4, 1986, police firing incident at Sherpur bridge in Nakodar (Jalandhar) on October 31, 1986, and submitted the report to then Shiromani Akali Dal government headed by chief minister Surjit Singh Barnala.Ravinder Singh, Jhalman Singh, Baldhir Singh and Harminder Singh had died in the police firing and theShiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee(SGPC) had put up their pictures at the Sikh museum in Amritsar a few years ago.The commission in its report, a copy of which is with TOI, found that then SP (operations) A K Sharma, who was heading the police force, did not seek mandatory permission from district magistrate Darbara Singh Guru before resorting to firing at the mob. “The order that effective firing should be on the lower part of the body was totally ignored and it appears that the four persons who died were aimed (hit) at the vital parts of their bodies so as to kill them,” concludes the panel report.After the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) raised the issue in the Punjab assembly’s ongoing budget session to make the report public, speaker Rana K P Singh told the House on Wednesday that the panel report was presented in the state assembly on December 16, 1986, and also on March 5, 2001, but action taken report on the panel’s report was never presented in the assembly.The commission had recorded, “All these circumstances show that the situation was not properly handled by A K Sharma and he did not even get the help of SSP Jalandhar (Mohammad Izhar Alam, who later retired as state police DGP) and district magistrate Jalandhar (Darbara Singh Guru), who were available.” Guru later remained principal secretary to chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and after retirement, unsuccessfully contested assembly election on SAD ticket in 2012 from Bhadaur constituency.“The mob was not armed with such weapons with which they could cause any danger to the security forces. They were still at a distance of 15 to 20 yards from the security forces and there was no danger to the lives of the security men, nor to any public man,” the panel added.“The mob simply proceeded to go to the gurdwara for ‘darshan’ of the holy burnt ‘birs’ and firing was ordered. For the simple injuries on persons of some policemen, killing of four persons and injuring eight persons was not justified.”A US-based couple, Baldev Singh and his wife Balbir kaur, had written to Punjab CM Amarinder Singh last year, asking him to reveal the contents of a judicial commission’s report on the Behbal Kalan firing-like killing of four Sikh youths in Nakodar, Jalandhar district, on February 4, 1986.The demand by the couple, who are parents of victim Ravinder Singh, had come close on the heels of Amarinder announcing that the probe report on Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan firing would soon be tabled in the state assembly."

We tried to redress with the faculty, but they did not listen,” said a member of the FTII Students’ Association (FSA).The inquiry committed was constituted on January 17.

Angry villagers blocked a road putting the leopard’s cub in the middle of the road. The situation was pacified only after police intervention.After the incident, the forest officials also gave an assurance that soon all the leopards will be caught from the nearby villages. District Forest Officer, Kanhiya Patel, said, “The leopard cub caught by the farmers was taken into the custody of the forest officials. The cub is healthy but is not in-taking food due to the stress. Hopefully, that will start soon. We send him to the Kanpur zoo. A large number of leopards have strayed out of the forest and made the adjacent sugarcane fields their home. This is due to the rising population of tigers in the nearby Amangarh Tiger Reserve and Corbett National Park situated near Thakurdwara tehsil.”Villagers allege that the man-animal conflicts in the region have multiplied and the farmers in the region fear going to fields due to the many leopard attack incidents in the recent past. The latest victim, identified as Hori Singh, a resident of Balapur village, was attacked by a leopard when he was sleeping in his animal shed adjacent to his house.Meanwhile, wildlife experts say that man-animal conflict increases during the winter season. Big cats, including tigers and leopards, tend to stray out to open areas, thereby, increasing the possibility of them coming in contact with humans."

He alleged that the privatisation bid is an election fund-raising programme of the BJP.Earlier, the LDF had observed a ‘Black Day’ in December, when the central government went forward with its decision to include Trivandrum airport in the bid and asked the state government to participate in the bidding process.The state government formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV), the Trivandrum International Airport Limited, to participate in the bidding process.Allegations have been raised that the LDF launched the indefinite strike after it realized that the possibilities were dim for the state government to win the bid.The protest conducted by the airport authority employees at the airport has crossed 73 days, with taxi drivers’ union also extending its support.The AAI employees said that the government can still prevent the privatisation bid by refusing to agree with the PPP model.The Trivandrum Airport Users Group, a collective of city residents who frequently travel through Trivandrum airport, has planned to conduct a counter-protest against the indefinite protest launched against privatisation bid. They plan to hold the protest in the weekend. “Our aim is to mobilize more airport users who would speak about the need for privatisation of the airport,” said Robin K Rajan, a member of the collective."

The protesters later tried to barge into the cabin of zilla parishad CEO Pavneet Kaur, but were detained by the police.Leftist leader Ram Baheti accused the state government for not increasing the monthly honorarium of anganwadi workers for the past four months despite announcement from the Centre.“Anganwadi sevikas are slated to get a hike of Rs1,500 per month taking their salary to Rs9,000 per month, while monthly honorarium of anganwadi assistants is expected to increase from Rs3,500 per month to Rs4,500 per month, as announced by the Centre. The state government, however, has failed to endorse the decision taken by the Central government,” Baheti said, adding that affected staffers were running out of patience.Pressing for reforms in the transfer policy, Baheti said the existing rules do not allow posting of Anganwadi workers near their home. “The monthly honorarium of staffers is relatively low and they cannot afford expenses towards travelling far from their homes. There is a need to reform the existing anti-employee norms,” he said.Among other demands, protesters also raised the pitch for release of retirement benefits. “The government in the past had announced one-time retirement benefit of Rs1 lakh and Rs75,000 to anganwadi sevikas and assistants, respectively. However, no such aid has been released,” an anganwadi sevika said.The protest also saw overwhelming response to the demand for releasing pending Travelling Allowance (TA). “The TA of staffers is kept on hold for over three years.

The hostel union then agreed to make changes to the puja to make it more inclusive and to “end the objectification”. This year, the posters of an actress and actor as Damdami Mai and Love Guru were replaced by a poster ofVirat KohliandAnushka Sharmaas a symbol of a successful relationship. The union also hung posters saying “love has no gender” to include LGBTQI representation, and did away with its usual ‘aarti’.Hindu College’s students held a discussion before V-Day to register their objections to the annual pujaHowever, on the morning of February 14, when the puja was being performed, members of a few political parties including the Students’ Federation of India (SFI), as well as the women’s collective Pinjra Tod, protested against the puja. “The hostel union had made changes to the puja and tried to be gender inclusive this year. But when the puja was being performed, some outsiders from different parties and organisations tried to stop the puja, which actually made the scene violent. Not just boys, some girls were also hurt while they tried to stop the puja. This was an event by students of Hindu College, and we do not approve of violence or entry of outsiders to create a ruckus in our college. There were many students so we do not know if they belonged to one group or various groups,” a source from the college told us.The SFI, in a statement, alleged that they were at the receiving end of the violence, saying, “The festival is nothing more than a celebration of toxic masculinity and patriarchal notions of virginity. We express our solidarity with all the progressive forces that stand against this festival.

The PWD chief engineer has been instructed to file a compliance report,” said Negi.The proposal was conceptualized last year and the cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 70 lakh.The PWD officials, on the other hand, claimed that the clearance was given only for the construction of a concrete bridge, whereas Negi had been demanding for a steel bridge.“We had cleared the proposal to construct a concrete bridge, but another proposal was forwarded to us for construction of a steel bridge.

In November last year, Guha declined to join Ahmedabad University (AU) as Shrenik Lalbhai Chair Professor of Humanities and director of the Gandhi Winter School after ABVP activists influenced the board members of AU members to refuse the position to Guha. Back then, Guha had tweeted that he will not be joining AU “due to circumstances beyond his (Guha’s) control”. Later ABVP secretary Pravin Desai in a statement admitted to oppose Guha’s appointment in an educational institution in Gujarat citing `anti-national content from his book `Makers of Modern India'.Interestingly, Doshi's silence has baffled many as he too has suffered right wing vandalism. Back in 1990s, an underground art gallery called Hussain-Doshi Gufa — designed by Doshi as a permanent exhibition of late artist M F Husain’s paintings — was vandalized by a right wing organization. ""Doshi protested by renaming the art gallery as ‘Amdavad ni Gufa’ and the exhibition was closed to public. The gallery was attacked again in 2002 after it reopened,"" recalls an educationist.Mevani, who has criticized trustees succumbing to right-wing pressure, told TOI, “Beginning Wednesday, in each of the public address at Rajkot,Thiruvananthapuram, and in Guwahati, I will speak openly about our teacher’s stand and the regressive behaviour of the BJP-led governments in the country and how they are suffocating democratic institutions.

Mobile internet services have been suspended indefinitely across Manipur. The move came as a pre-emptive measure after the Rajya Sabha Business Advisory Committee listed the bill in the revised list of business for Tuesday, but could not take it up after the House was adjourned till Wednesday.Security was stepped up and police put up barricades at all strategic locations across Imphal. Police also made frequent announcements, asking people to stay indoors as restrictions under Section 144 have been put into effect.Civil society bodies, Peoples’ Alliance Manipur (PAM) and Manipur People Against Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016 (MANPAC) have been spearheading the protests against the bill in the state. A 36-hour bandh, called by 72 civil society organizations under PAM, has been in effect across the state from Monday morning. Anti-bill protesters took part in the black flag rallies and blocked roads by putting up barricades and burning tyres in the Meitei-dominated valley districts of Manipur of Monday. These protests continued on Tuesday with women vendors at the Ima Market in Imphal still staging a sit-in against the proposed legislation.On Tuesday, protests against the bill were held in the valley districts of Thoubal, Bishnupur, Kakching and Jiribam. Women protesters staged roadblocks and formed human chains, burning effigies of PM Narendra Modi. At Thoubal, a large number of women blocked the Imphal-Moreh highway and demanded resignation of all the 60 MLAs.Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh and his Arunachal Pradesh counterpart Pema Khandu met Union home minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi on Monday and urged the Centre not to pass the bill in the Rajya Sabha. Union minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju was also present in the meeting. The two chief ministers, during the meeting, conveyed to Rajnath the sentiments of the northeast people against the bill. The home minister, in turn, assured them that the Centre “stands with the people of the northeast and will address all concerns related to the bill”.A delegation of political parties from Manipur also met Rajnath and BJP general secretary Ram Madhav and urged them not to pass the bill in the Rajya Sabha.Meanwhile, a Congress delegation headed by former Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh and party president Gaikhangam on Tuesday staged a demonstration at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, demanding the withdrawal of the bill. MANPAC has urged the Congress to not stage a walkout and oppose the bill when it is tabled in the Rajya Sabha. Congress has already issued a three-line whip to its Rajya Sabha members asking them to be present when the bill is tabled and oppose the proposed legislation."

AUSU is dominated by SP’s student wing.Targeting the government, Akhilesh claimed that he also had to attend a lunch hosted by Akhara Parishad chief at Kumbh Mela ground, which the ruling BJP was not comfortable with.Chief minister Yogi Adtiyanath, however, said the decision to stop SP president from boarding the flight was taken on the recommendation of Allahabad district authorities which feared a law and order crisis on his arrival.It all began around 11am when Yadav reached Amausi airport to board a special flight to Allahabad but was stopped by district officials following which he demanded a written order to this effect. In the melee, Akhilesh’s security personnel allegedly heckled a district official when he tried to stop him physically.As Akhilesh waited for the written order from officials, he tweeted: “I was prevented from boarding the airplane without any written orders. Currently detained at Lucknow airport.”He also tweeted photographs, apparently clicked from inside the aircraft he was to board, showing one administration official and a police officer at its gate blocking the entry of Akhilesh who stood on tarmac.Principal secretary (home) Arvind Kumar said that the Allahabad University administration had denied permission to allow any political leader’s presence at AUSU event and had communicated the same to district officials in Allahabad who in turn intimated CM’s office and DM Lucknow.“It was on the recommendation of Prayagraj district administration, that authorities in Lucknow stopped Akhilesh Yadav,” said inspector general law and order Praveen Kumar.SP chief posted a couple of tweets and held a press conference stating that BJP was scared of his visit to Allahabad and his growing popularity among students.“I wasn’t going to meet the students only. I was to attend a lunch hosted by Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri as well, but I was not allowed,” he said.“Ye Uttar Pradesh ke mukhya mantri kaise sadhu sant yogi hain … jo doosre sadhu sant yogiyon se nahi milne dena chahte (What kind of seer, yogi is this UP CM who doesn’t allow people to meet other saints),” Akhilesh said addressing media at party headquarters.He also alleged that additional intelligence sleuths were deployed outside his residence since 6.30am but they did not inform him about the restrictions when he left for airport.Cautioning Yogi to face similar treatment, he said: “Yaad rakhein, agar yeh vyahvar ye kar rahe hain to apne saath bhi taiyar rahein … ki aisa hi vyavhar inke saath hoga (They should be prepared, similar treatment will be meted out to them).”About CM’s claims that the government had informed him in advance about the decision that he will not be allowed to attend the AUSU event, Akhilesh said CM Yogi should not lie because he is a a seer. “Sadhu, Sanyasi hokar jhooth nahi bolna chahiye,” he said.Asked if the government move was connected in anyway to a similar restriction imposed in 2015 on then Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath’s visit to Allahabad University for a student union event by then SP government, Akhilesh said the two cannot be compared as Yogi has a host of criminal cases against him while he has none.In Lucknow, SP MLAs and MLCs staged a sit-in at Raj Bhawan seeking governor Ram Naik’s intervention against police action on SP workers. The protest was called off after Raj Bhawan staff informed that the governor was out of station. A 15-member joint delegation of SP-BSP will hand over a memorandum to governor Naik on Wednesday.The development led to statewide protests by SP workers inviting police action in which sitting MP Dharmendra Yadav and several others were injured during cane charge in Allahabad. In Lucknow, party workers staged protest outside the airport while both houses were adjourned following unruly scenes and walkout by SP lawmakers."

The stir will be guided by Shramik Mukti Dal president Bharat Patankar.“The demands of farmers and landless persons been long pending before the administration and the government,” Ban said.Provision of substitute lands from Gangapur Bhendala Agriculture Corporation to the farmers affected by the Tembhapuri Dam project and return of plots and lands in Jayakwadi to the original owners on lease comprise key demands. Ban said several assurances have been given by the government on the Tembhapuri Dam project since 2013. “In Jayakwadi, the government had acquired land to raise a residential colony for people in the project. However, till date, no utilisation of the said land is done. So we are demanding that the land be returned to original owners,” he said.Farmers affected by land disputes and projects in Warudi village ofPaithanwill also gather at the protest. Several meetings in the past with the district collector, other officials and government authorities have failed to bear results, so this stir is a measure of last resort – and it will continue until demands are met, Ban said."

Six women were injured as police fired teargas shells and threw smoke bombs to disperse antibill protesters in Imphal on Sunday evening.Protests by women vendors at Imphal’s Ima Market continued on Monday. Women vendors across the city have staged a sit-in protest since Saturday. Shantidevi, president of a women’s association at Khwairamband market, said of the Sunday evening violence, that police used force to disperse the agitators, who were protesting peacefully. They tried to destroy tents and pulled down the banners that sought the unconditional revocation of the bill, she said.“Six women were injured. The situation turned uglier when they tried to take one of the injured women into custody and the agitators had to thwart the attempt,” Shantidevi said. Criticising the use of “excessive force” by police, MANPAC convenor Y Dillipkumar said, “The assault on women vendors indicates the state is acting under the Centre’s command.” He said statements by PM Modi and home minister Rajnath Singh that the bill would not affect Manipur and the other northeastern states are “aimed at pacifying protesters”.In Guwahati on Monday, police detained over 100 members of the Left-Democratic Manch, a joint forum of 10 parties headed by CPI, CPM and NCP, as agitators went to lay siege to the Assam legislative assembly as part of the anti-CAB agitation. A scuffle broke out between security personnel and protesters, the latter accusing police of high-handedness. Over 100 protesters were detained but released later in the day.“By staying firm on their stand on the CAB, despite people’s movements against it, BJP-led government has shown how undemocratic it is… Three state governments in northeast have opposed the bill.

Bainsla maintained that neither he nor anyone else from the rail tracks will go for talks.Gujjars occupying rail tracks with Bainsla, on the other hand, are losing interest. TheGujjarAarakshan Sangharsh Samiti has urged them to keep faith in Bainsla.Members of Gujjar community on the railway tracks woke up in anticipation that their fellow members in rest of the state should also join the stir and participate in the road jam. By the afternoon their news network from various parts ofRajasthanfetched them details on road jams at Sikandara in Dausa, Kushali Darra in Sawai Madhopur and other parts of the state. The internet services were suspended at Malrana Dungar area and the villages surrounding the railway tracks on Monday evening.Bainsla appeared little exhausted and angry with the dilly dally approach of the state government. “We had given ultimatum to the state government 20 days ago and when we were unheard we came on the tracks. A day after cabinet minister Vishvendra Singh and bureaucrat Neeraj K Pawan came and we have told them loud and clear that we will not budge from the tracks. We are into the fourth day and there is no message from the state government,” said Bainsla while talking to TOI.“I can hold my youth and men for some time but if they lose patience government is to be blamed,” he said.Bainsala through video calling appealed Gujjars in various parts of the state to jam the state and national highways across the state. He urged that neither he nor the Gujjars will move from the tracks until government hands them over the notification confirming 5 percent reservation under Most Backward Classes(MBC) including Gujjars.Tourism ministerVishvendra Singh, who is camping at Sawai Madhopur, said, “We went to the tracks as demanded by the Gujjar community and requested them to prepare their team to sit with us and discuss it out. I have been waiting for the past 2 days since I invited them. Government is ready to initiate talks with Bainsla saab who is universally accepted leaders of the community.”“Things would be resolved only through talks. We are trying our best,” said Neeraj K Pawan, the IAS officer who is part of two-member delegation that had parleys with the Gujjars on Saturday at the railway tracks.The protesters were clueless on what is going to be next? “We have seen enough in our fight for quota and it is high time that we should stay united and continue to be on the tracks. Be patient the government will have to give what we deserve,” Bainsla said while addressing the community members on the tracks.The train services remained affected on the Delhi-Mumbai rail route. At least 22 trains remained diverted while almost 12 trains were cancelled so far on the route. The trains on the Delhi Mumbai route are been diverted via Sawai Madhopur-Kota-Baran since the rail tracks were jammed."

It demanded action against a company which extracted money from youths in the name of providing them training at a job fair held exactly a year ago.An unemployed Angrej Kaur from Sekha village also joined the protest, saying many girls paid Rs 2,000 each in the name of providing training and no job was given to them. The Akali workers claimed that they had given a complaint to the Barnala SSP last week, demanding action against such firms that exploit youths in the name of providing them jobs. Angrej Kaur, a 23-year-old graduate in humanities, said, “I had gone to a job fair organised by ITI Barnala on February 12-13, 2018, along with Simranjit Kaur of Dhanaula and Jyoti Rani of Barnala. A company from Mohali had given us job offer letters and asked us to go to its Mohali office. When we went there (Mohali) after a few days, we were asked to pay Rs 2,000 each for training before getting jobs. Hoping to get the jobs, we paid the money but have neither been provided any job even after a year nor returned our money.”Former Punjab chief minister Surjit Singh Barnala’ grandson and Akali leader Simar Pratap Singh said, “A few days ago, these girls had approached us and we had given a complaint to the SSP. When no action was taken, we held a protest at the DC office today. We want the government to select companies for job fairs after checking their credentials to stop the exploitation of unemployed youth.” He said if the youth are not provided jobs and action is not taken against such companies, the party will keep on holding protests.Barnala SSP Harjit Singh said preliminary inquiries by the district administratiion officials revealed that these girls had not registered themselves at the job fair. “I have marked the matter to the DSP for probe and appropriate action will be taken,” he said."

The communidade wants to develop small residential plots on the land for its ‘gaunkars’, he said.He added that a Baga resident had also laid claim to the land as a tenant and had approached the court, which had dismissed her claim, after which the communidade had approached the NGPDA. The plot is on the plateau and does not have an access road.Lobo said other land owners in the area had also sought conversion to settlement zone, but the NGPDA had rejected their applications as hill slopes are eco-sensitive zones.Lobo also said the Arpora-Nagoa panchayat had written to the NGPDA to show a road to the hilltop on the ODP, adding that the alleged illegal road was not being constructed by the panchayat or the NGPDA.There is also a proposal to build a ‘Jesus retreat park’ on the land overlooking the sea with a giant statue of Jesus Christ. There is already a Jesuit retreat house at Baga.With locals, activists, panchayat members and the Calangute MLA making claims and counter claims, there are others who want the area to be left untouchable. “It’s one of the most beautiful places in Goa and should not be destroyed by development.

She gladly obliged most of them.However, it was her impromptu decision to join her brother and Congress presidentRahul Gandhiin lifting the dummy model of Rafale that left many wondering if there is more to her than the striking resemblance to Indira Gandhi. While Rahul rallied behind the 'Chowkidar-hichor-hai' chorus, the Congress eastern UP in-charge firmly held the handle carrying the Rafale jet model.Priyanka arrived with Rahul at 12.25pm on Monday on a four-day visit to the state. The visit is aimed at turning the Congress's fortunes in the state in which it had fared miserably in the2014 Lok Sabha elections, winning just two of 80 seats in the state.Priyanka spoke largely in gestures, smiles and victory poses. But her Rafale act was an indication that she has shunned the limited role of just nurturing family boroughs of Amethi and Rae Bareli. And as she did, the chorus shifted from jibes onRafale rowto ""Dushmano ki andhi hai, yeh nayi Indira Gandhi hai [Beware rivals, this is the new Indira Gandhi]"".

The district sugarcane department has issued notices to the mills over pending dues and said that it any untoward incident happens at the mahapanchayat, the mills will be held responsible.The face-off continued with farmers gearing up to hold mahapanchayat at Rashidpur Gari village on the outskirts of the village. The demand includes action against the police officials involved in lathicharge on farmers on February 4 who had come to the collectorate to mount pressure for clearing their dues. The police also registered cases against the farmers under section seven of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and some other relevant sections.Addressing a press conference, national convenor of Azad Kisan Union, Rajendra Singh said, “Administration had committed atrocities on the farmers. Their crime was that they were demanding their sugarcane dues of previous year. We are doing our agitation peacefully but police suddenly started beating us. They forced the farmers to run for a kilometre and thrashed them. No farmer was on rampage during the agitation but police slapped cases under section seven of Criminal Law Amendment Act on agitators, which is normally imposed on dreaded criminals. Farmers are ready now to register their protest against this cruelty by holding mahapanchayat.”“Administration and police betrayed the farmers by making false assurance to us. They had assured us that sugarcane dues be cleared by Feb 11 and case against farmers will be withdrawn. Neither case has been withdrawn, nor pending sugarcane dues was cleared given to the farmers,” Singh added.Thousands of farmers are expected to take part in the mahapanchayat with around 20 farmer outfits likely to share the stage, he noted.Accusing the police of trying to crush farmers' voices, Singh alleged that officials raided their homes on Sunday and Monday.Two sugar mills of wave group have so far not paid dues worth Rs 62 crores of the previous year, which has led to 25 protests by farmers.On being asked about the matter, district cane officer, Yashpal Singh, said, “We have served notices to the wave group for not paying dues the farmers. We have given stern warning to them that they would be held responsible for any untoward incident during farmer agitation. There are nine mills in the district. Out which seven have done the dues of previous year and they have also started making payment of current crushing year. Only Bijnor and Chandpur mills have not given previous dues so far.”According to sources, the group was not ready to operate the mills and have not paid the dues. It is believed the group wants to shut these units."

We have diverted the traffic from Kundal so that traffic is not affected by it,” Dausa SP Prahlad Singh Krishnia informed TOI.The police are particularly on high alert for Sikandara as the same place had witnessed flare ups during the previous phases of Gujjar agitation. DG (law and order) ML Lather said that fourth day of agitation began with protesters blocking traffic on Banas bridge in Tonk, Bari- Baseri state highway in Dholpur, and Topa in Nainwa tehsil under Bundi district.The agitation, led by Kirori Singh Bainsla and his followers, began by occupying railway tracks in Sawai Madhopur four days ago.“Traffic was blocked near Khetri in Jhunjhunu but it was later cleared. Efforts are being made to ensure that common people do not face any problems,” he said.Section 144 was imposed in Bharatpur, Dholpur, and Karauli. On Monday, the district administration in Tonk also issued directions to implement preventive measures to avert any untoward situation.The Gujjar agitation has affected train traffic on Delhi-Mumbai route. Over 15 trains under the Kota division have been cancelled while 12 have been diverted. Top officials of theRajasthanpolice held a several hour-long discussions and directed SPs to ensure traffic diversion through alternative routes whenever a road is blocked.Meanwhile, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday once again appealed to Gujjar leader Bainsla not to cause inconvenience to passengers. “The Gujjar community knows that in my previous tenure we had introduced one per cent quota for the community,” he said, adding that he would do whatever he could to help the community and called for dialogues."

The city police authorities are working on devising a master plan that would help reduce the chaos on roads owing to such marches and protests.City police commissioner S Surendran said that effective sharing of information will be a key factor for the proposed master plan.“At present, whenever there is a protest or procession on the road, the responsibility of traffic diversion is only on the officials at the local police station in the proximity. Hence, the motorists become aware of diversions only after they have reached close to the spot where action is taking place. This is what creates snarls on the roads,” the commissioner said.For example, motorists going to East Fort fromKesavadasapuram, Sasthamangalam and Poojapura, which are in different directions, become aware of a protest happening in front of the secretariat only after they have reached near the Statue Junction. By that time, it would be too late and all the motorists would be forced to take the same bylanes to avoid the main road. If these motorists knew in advance before entering the MG Road about the protest happening atStatue Junction, they could easily take alternative routes and thus avoid being trapped in snarls, the commissioner elaborated the idea behind the master plan.“Henceforth, we have decided to alert all police stations in the city whenever there is a protest on any of the roads,” the commissioner said. The police personnel on traffic duty under local police stations can initiate measures to warn the motorists.The police have plans to introduce public announcement (PA) systems in major junctions in the city to warn motorists. This is because warning motorists usingtraffic copson roads would be a tough task. At present PA systems exist only at a handful of junctions in the city. Majority of them are on junctions along the MG Road. The police also have plans to tie up with radio stations to broadcast messages.The two assistant commissioners of city traffic are entrusted with the task of preparing a master plan.The proposed master plan is just one of the various measures undertaken by the city police to keep the roads safe for motorists and pedestrians. At present, the police are also engaged in the works of installing barricades on medians on busy roads to prevent jaywalking. This is because accidents were frequently being reported owing to pedestrians crossing the road carelessly.Also, the police had been strictly checking vehicles and motorists during the past one week as part of Road Safety Week observance. The special drive concluded on Sunday. According to the police, around 6,000 motorists were booked during this period for various offences such as drunken driving, rash driving and not wearing helmets and seatbelts."

The barrage coming up 25km upstream of the mouth of the Arabian sea was intended to tackle south Gujarat’s severesalinityingress issues.Gujarat government has now expressed concerns that the proposed barrage may lose all its sweet water “in no time” in the future if the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) continues to notify the barrage as National Waterway-73 meant for large class VII vessels (carrying 2,000 tonne Dead Weight Tonnage) instead of marking it for smaller class III vessels (carrying 500 tonne DWT).The Bhadbhut barrage was announced last year with the promise to improve groundwater quality in upper reaches of the Narmada and to store 600 millioncubic metrewater for domestic use — almost 400 million litres per day (MLD) for 31 villages and 910 MLD for Dahej industrial water supply.In a letter to the IWAI on January 1 the state government through chief secretary J N Singh has claimed that the whole project will become “impractical” if class VII vessels enter Bhadbhut inland water channel. The reason being that a large amount of water will have to be stored and then released to keep class VII vessels afloat, say sources.Senior government official’s claim that the current 600 cusecs of water released from the Narmada dam is enough to keep class III vessels afloat.For class VII vessels the flow will have to be increased to 1,700 to 2,200 cusecs. IWAI wants that the width of the navigational lock be also increased from 15.5 metres to 18 metres and also the channel length deepened.The state government has further represented in the letter, “In the downstream of theSardar Sarovar Dam, there is no fresh water inflow for a significantly long period during the year in Narmada river.” Singh has further stated in the letter, “Ground reality is that barring Dahej, there is no possibility of any industrial establishment that can consume large quantity of goods to be navigated through river way,” the government states in the letter.The letter further adds, “Five bridges are there in the upstream of the barrage which can facilitate class-III vessels. The draft in the river is also very low and in case a big navigational facility (class VII vessel) is operated, the precious sweet water reservoir would be emptied in no time.”The IWAI’s decision on August 24 last year also asked Gujarat to make major structural changes to all the five bridges on the Narmada before the barrage to allow large class VII vessels to pass through."

He said that the police did not resort to canecharge.The teachers have been agitating against the state government's new policy of regularisation in which they are being asked to join on a monthly salary of Rs 15,300.Recently, the Sanjha Adhyapak Morcha and Panjab Bachao Manch had decided to protest under the banner of Adhyapak Sangharsh committee through which a large number of contractual teachers demanded regularisation.Teachers claimed that despite the release of the funds by the ministry of human resource and development (MHRD), the government slashed the salaries of the teachers who didn’t accept its offer on new terms. They claimed that already a number of teachers under RMSA and SSA were working on contractual basis for the past many years and were drawing salaries up to Rs 45,000.Devinder Punia, the co-convener of teachers' union, said, “The government has paid no heed to our demands and very cunningly they made a number of teachers join on new terms and conditions. We have been protesting since long, but chief minister Captain Amarinder has not met us till now. Today, the police cane-charged us leaving over three dozens teachers injured.”The police had prior information about the protest rally and had even appealed the teachers not to protest on the occasion of Basant Panchami. The teachers had, earlier, planned to carry out the protest from Veer Haqiat ground to YPS Chowk but later changed the route near Fountain Chowk, to circumvent the police. The police, on the other hand, shifted their water-cannon vans and anti-riot vehicles to the new spot.Meanwhile, CM Amarinder Singh has assured the teachers and other employees of early resolution of their demands.On Sunday he appealed to the protesters to shun the path of agitation and have patience, as the state government was committed to finding an amicable solution to their pending demands.Singh said the employees must understand that despite the unprecedented financial crises being faced by the state, the government was doing everything in its power to resolve the issues of the employees. He said that agitations will not lead to any constructive solution and talks will soon be held to find a way out.Underlining that all employees, including teachers, were the most intrinsic part of society, the CM assured them that the cabinet sub-committee formed under health minister Brahm Mahindra was already working to find a solution to their demands. The chief minister said that he too would soon meet the representatives of various employees’ bodies to resolve their issues."

The cost of the project has been pegged at Rs 687 crore.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, ""China's position on the China-India boundary question is consistent and clear-cut. The Chinese government has never recognised the so called 'Arunachal Pradesh' and is firmly opposed to the Indian leader's visit to the East Section of the China-India boundary.""China urges the Indian side to proceed from the overall situation of bilateral relations, respect China's interests and concerns, cherish the momentum of improving relations between the two countries, and refrain from any actions that intensify disputes and complicate the border issue,"" Chunying said using words a little stronger than usual. The proposed all-weather tunnel is expected to help impart a much-needed strategic thrust to Indian military forces against China.""The project covers a total distance of 12.04 km, with two tunnels of 1,790 and 475 metres. Once completed, the tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang and other forward areas. It will reduce the travelling time from Tezpur to Tawang in a major way.

While the local administration has cleared that they have not been approached by the farmers to seek permission for holding the mahapanchayat, the farmers refuse to melt down the protests until payments are made. Talking to TOI, national convenor of Azad Kisan Union, Rajendra Singh, said, “We will hold our mahapanchayat on February 12 at any cost. This battle is not just confined to the sugarcane dues but has become a prestige issue for the farmers now.”On being asked about the ongoing matter, SDM Bijnor, Brajesh Singh, said, “Citing security concerns, Section 144 has been enforced here. So far, no permission has been sought by the farmers for the mahapanchayat.”The matter has taken a political hue with the RLD announcing its support for the mahapanchayat. RLD chief Chaudhary Ajit Singh even met the agitating farmers on Friday. Addressing the farmers, Ram Mehar, state president of RLD’s Kisan Prakoshth, slammed the ruling party and alleged that the BJP government has failed to resolve the problems of the farmers. He said, “BJP had promised that the farmers would get their sugarcane dues cleared within 14 days of the delivery of crop to the mills, but the party has sidelined the farmer’s interest after coming into power. When farmers ask for their dues, they are thrashed badly. Farmers will give a bitter reply to the BJP in the upcoming polls.”Meanwhile, sources said that BJP’s district unit has sent videos of farmers being thrashed to the party high command stating that the matter has become very sensitive and needs attention, especially with the Lok Sabha polls round the corner."

On Saturday the residents of Save Humanity, a new formation, gathered to show solidarity with the settlers. ""We are not entering the legal aspects of the debate. We are asking that the civic authorities provide these 150 people alternate accommodation on humanitarian grounds.

The Dalit community members allegedly received threats from the influential people of the village, but nevertheless decided to continue with the protest.Sohan, son of the deceased woman Sugani, said that the place was meant for carrying out cremation in their community since hundreds of years, but now the place has been encroached upon. Police got the information andTehsildarof Kishangarh along with police, reached the spot and tried to convince the influential people to remove the encroachment. The revenue record was also retrieved from the patwari and it was revealed that the place belonged to the village and was marked as a cremation centre. The administrative officials ordered to remove the encroachment and in the presence of police, the structure was dismantled and in the evening, the dead body of the woman was cremated.

BJP state president Madan Lal Saini was arrested while marching towards the CM residence, along with the BJP leaders and workers. The protest march started at 11am from the BJP headquarters to theCivil Lines, with chanting of slogans against the state government.Police swung into action when the protesters tried to jump the barricades causing injuries to aBJP Mahila Morchaactivist Anju Mishra. She sustained fracture in her right hand and was admitted to SMS Hospital. Later, Saini visited the poly trauma ward of the SMS Hospital to meet the injured and assured of all help till she recuperates.Prior to the march, Saini addressed the protesters and said, “It is the duty of the BJP to expose the Congress’ series of blatant lies, that they had spread during the polls. The courting arrest is a reminder to the Congress that the BJP is still a force, and a message for the people of the state that the party stands with them always.” Saini charged the Congress of deceiving farmers by making a hollow promise of waiving the loans in the first 10 days of their government formation. “The promise is still not fulfilled by the government. Our commitment is to ensure that they should either fulfil the promise or apologize to them,” said Saini.He also took the credit for the government starting the loan waiver camps from Friday. “This is due to the pressure from the BJP that they have started the process,” said Saini. The march was attended by senior BJP leaders including Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra, former cabinet minister Arun Chaturvedi, Sanganer MLA Ashok Lahoty and others.Anand Sharma, BJP communications team, claimed that over 10,000 people have attended the protest. “This is a stern message for the Congress that the BJP will not hesitate in going to any extent for the people ofRajasthan,” said Sharma. Similar protest was done in other districts by the BJP. The protest went peaceful across the state except the injury of Mishra in Jaipur."

As part of the protest, farmers did not even send their wards to schools.Recently, the Gujarat High Court has ordered the concerned magistrate to initiate criminal proceeding in the atrocity committed by police on farmers or lodged an FIR to investigate the allegations of excesses.Farmers are opposed to limestone mining on the grounds that their fields would be rendered non-fertile. They said the water in their wells has also turned saline as the company digs land 300 foot to 400 foot deep to extract limestone.Bharat Bhil, a local farmer leader, said, “Despite our continuous protests, mining activity continues in the area. We had sent proposed that the government officials, elected representatives of our area and company officials should hold a meeting with us to understand our problem. However, they didn’t pay heed.”District collector Hasmukh Patel said, “I have yet to receive the copy of order but as per my knowledge National Green Tribunal (NGT) has rejected the petition of farmers.

On February 11,Andhra Pradeshchief minister N Chandrababu Naidu will be in Delhi, sitting on a day-long dharna (sit-in) at the Andhra Bhawan premises along with his party colleagues, to protest against the Centre for denying “special status” to the state that the TDP government has been demanding since its bifurcation in 2014.Other anti-BJP opposition party leaders (22-odd parties) who have come together on a “Save Democracy” platform to combat the ruling BJP together, are likely to call on the chief minister and TDP chief, making it a rallying point, with the message that the entire spectrum of parties are preparing to take on BJP at the national level together.This show of solidarity will be followed by a “dharna” byWest Bengalchief minister and Trinamool Congress chiefMamata Banerjeebetween February 13 and 14, as she is planning to bring her protest movement that started in Kolkata last weekend, to Delhi, to ensure that her battle with the centre on the issue of “attack on federalism” is also fought in the national capital and not just at her doorstep.Last Sunday, Banerjee turned “a CBI attempt to raid the Kolkata police commissioner’s residence” into a political stage, where most of the opposition leaders came out and stood with her making it national issue about “the Centre’s strike on the state,” yielding only after a Supreme Court intervention in the matter the next day. What unfurled overnight as the chief minister sat on a “dharna” on the streets of Kolkata, ensured that solidarity among the 22-odd anti-BJP parties found a new cause and reassembly in Delhi before, the nation goes in for elections.Between Banerjee, Naidu and leaders of NCP, RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, JD(S), Left and Congress among others, the opposition hopes to make an impact with its strong presence and clear message to their respective electorate on the eve of the next general elections."

Citizens are unable to pay the tax which is increasing every year. Moreover, KMC has planned to hike tax in addition to the already increasing tax amount. The system was imposed on us without considering our view. We were told that the amount will be utilised to build roads and develop public amenities. However, we have seen that huge tax is collected by the KMC and no public amenities are developed.

The core areas of the city, with high ready reckoner rates, attract the highest tax."

We demand that they should be taken back immediately,” he added.Khanzode further said that the state government had introduced physical tests for home guards every three years. “How can guards who are over 45 pass these tests. Such tests should be held at the time of recruitment and not after that. Moreover, the government has ruled that a home guard will be recruited only for 12 years. What will the persons whose tenure is completed do after that,” he added.State president Suresh Dudhe said home guards’ work was similar to that of police personnel and hence they should be given equal pay and perks. “There should be 50% reservation for home guards in police recruitment,” he added.He further said that instead of taking cognisance of the demands, the home ministry has issued orders to terminate the services of guards who were participating in the agitation.Home guard district commandant Devendra Katolkar said finance ministerSudhir Mungantiwarhad held two meetings with the union leaders. “He is following up the issue.

The additional personnel deployed for the Road Safety Campaign diverted traffic to parallel passages, but the sheer vehicular volume soon choked the roads. Police officers alerted commuters to the diversions through messages on social media and variable display boards.Police said the hailstorm proved a hurdle in south and central Delhi after many cars idled on the roads, fearing collisions and crashes due to the slippery surface.In the afternoon, a protest by youngsters over unemployment resulted in gridlocks on Netaji Subhas Marg, Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, Ranjit Singh Flyover and Tolstoy Marg. Their procession caused snarls on Deshbandhu Gupta Marg and Rani Jhansi Road too.Some roads, especially those from Mehrauli to Gurgaon and Mehrauli to Badarpur, saw jams due to blockades and potholes that emerged after the rains. Heavy vehicles moved at a snail’s pace on these roads. Water logging near Anand Parbat created a similar situation on Rohtak Road in central Delhi."

They created pandemonium, repeatedly shouting “Go back CM”, “Step Down CM”, “Down, down government” and “No unity, no majority”.BJP leaders justified the protests, contending that the state government is a minority government and it does not have the required numbers. Countering this, Krishna Byre Gowda, rural development and panchayat raj minister, shouted: “The BJP should move a no-confidence motion if they feel that the Congress-JD(S) alliance does not have majority to run the government.”The agitating MLAs did not pay heed to speaker KR Ramesh Kumar's request to resume their seats, prompting him to adjourn proceedings for 10 minutes. When the House met again, BJP leaders continued with their protests, forcing Kumar to adjourn proceedings till 12.30pm Friday when chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will present the 2019-2020 state budget.“This is a new chapter in the history of Karnataka assembly proceedings,” Kumar said before adjourning the House. “It should not have occurred, but it is happening and not without reason.”The legislative council also witnessed similar scenes with BJP members trooping into the well of the House and raising slogans against the government. The House also saw a “placard war” with both BJP and JD(S)-Congress coalition leaders holding posters, running down each other’s party.The BJP placards in Kannada read: “10% commission government! After Puttrangshetty, who?”, “Hindu virodhi government”, ""Wakf board scamsters should step down"" and ""CM with no confidence step down”.The ruling coalition partners placards read: “Modi-Shah duo detrimental to Indian democracy"" and “Corruption is the ethos of BJP”.After the House was adjourned, former chief minister and Congress legislature party leaderSiddaramaiahtold reporters that it’s not fair on the part of the BJP to disrupt assembly proceedings and waste taxpayers money. “If they think we do not have the numbers, they should move a no-confidence motion. What is preventing them from doing so?” he said.But BS Yeddyurappa, opposition leader of the assembly, said, “We will not move a no-confidence motion. It’s not about the numbers. We are protesting because the coalition government does not have the moral right to continue in office and present a new budget when their own MLAs are defying a whip and absconding. We will continue our protests on Friday too.”"

Their mass gathering and protest created inconvenience to public servants and general public,” the FIR read.Speaking to TOI, Agra district president of Congress Dushyant Sharma said, “We had gone to hand over a memorandum to SSP Amit Pathak inside collectorate, after right wing men associated with BJP vandalised our office on Sunday afternoon, but the officer did not turned up, after which we staged peaceful protest.”He added that the FIR laid bare the intention of the police, which was acting as a puppet of the state government.“Lodging an FIR against us shows the approach and intentions of police who is acting as puppet of BJP government in the state. We have apprised our high command and will take appropriate action, if the police did not quash the FIR against us and arrest the right-wing men who vandalised our party office,” Sharma noted.The FIR was lodged at Nai Ki Mandi police station. Station house officer Prem Niwas Sharma, said, “We are probing the matter. The accused INC leader and men have been booked under IPC sections 147 (riot), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint), 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 342 (Punishment for wrongful confinement) and 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty).”"

As of now, the electricity department and the health department have been exempted from participating in the agitation but if our demand is not met with, the emergency services and power department will also be roped in to join the protest.”Tiwari added, “Meetings are being held repeatedly with chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey but to no avail. We have been raising our demands since long and in the absence of assurance, we were left with no other option. Our strike will continue till February 12.”Speaking to TOI, general secretary of UP Diploma Engineers’ Federation, GN Singh, said, “Departmental works in offices were completely boycotted for the day as employees in various districts were on protest. Offices of Vikas Bhawan, regional transport office, PWD, among others, were locked down as employees remained on the roads.”When asked about the repercussion of protest with Esma in effect, Singh said that the state government employees are prepared to face the consequences against them as they have been fighting for their rights and will continue to do so.Esma, that authorises the government to take punitive action against striking employees, was announced on Monday, after talks between the union leaders and chief secretary failed to reach a consensus. Esma was imposed in order to pre-empt strikes or agitations by state government employees for next six months."

She also announced a “Save-India, Save-Constitution” dharna in Delhi after a meeting of opposition parties on February 13 and 14.Banerjee had started the dharna at Metro Channel on Sunday evening — terming it an apolitical “satyagraha” — demanding an end to the misuse of central agencies by theNarendra Modigovernment. That followed a visit by CBI officers to the residence of Kolkata Police commissioner Rajeev Kumar “for questioning” him. The chief minister had immediately thrown her weight behind the commissioner.On Tuesday, Banerjee’s “moral victory” was because the apex court had stopped the CBI from taking any “coercive step” against Kumar.“This dharna is a victory for the Constitution and democracy; so, let us end it today,” Banerjee said.“We are so grateful and obliged to the Supreme Court,” said Banerjee, who appeared tense and seemed to be under pressure while sitting on the dais before the order went out at 11am. “It will strengthen the morale of the officials. The state and central service officers should respect each other. The central government has its jurisdictions and should not interfere in the state’s business. Central agencies are coming to arrest members of state agencies without any consultation with the state government. Don’t you think it disturbs the law and order machinery of the state? Whatever the state government has said is absolutely correct and we welcome the order,” she added.Accusing the Centre of misusing CBI, she said: “All political opponents are being harassed.... Tomorrow they will say arrest Mamata Banerjee because she wears hawai chappals.”The chief minister even remarked that it was good that Kumar has been asked to appear for the CBI probe in Shillong. “Good,” she said. “He works round the year. This will give him two days of relaxation.”Earlier in the day, the Trinamool Congress chief fished out the purported tell-all letter in 2013 from Saradha boss Sudipta Sen, now in jail, to substantiate her political vendetta charge against the Modi government. The Saradha boss, in the letter, had alleged that Congress-turned-BJP minister from Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, had taken money from him, a charge the minister has refuted. The letter also mentions the name of BJP junior minister Babul Supriyo. Banerjee referred to the letter — terming Supriyo the “Rose of Rose Valley” — and said that CBI had only arrested leaders of her party. Congress leader and lawyer Kapil Sibal also raised questions about the role of the “Trinamool man now in BJP”, without naming Mukul Roy, once considered the No. 2 man in the Trinamool Congress.Banerjee also had Prime Minister Narendra Modi directly in her crosshairs. “I am the one raising my voice against Narendra Modi. Why is he after us? His name was dragged in several cases like Godhra. Should I ask what had happened to Haren Pandya [home minister of Gujarat, murdered in 2003]?... Only I talk about these things. So they want to kill me.... They [the Central government] want to control all the agencies, including the state agencies also. PM, you resign from Delhi and go back to Gujarat. One man government, one party government is there,” Banerjee said.The CM poured scorn on UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who addressed a rally in Purulia on Tuesday. “He does not know from which seat he will be able to seek re-election. Isi liye Bangal mein ghumta rehta hai,” she said of him.The dharna may have been termed “apolitical”, but it became a rallying point for all 23 opposition party leaders, who had come down to Kolkata only a fortnight ago on January 19 to pledge support for a united opposition. While RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav, DMK MP Kanimozhi, TDP chief Chandrababu Nadu, Samajwadi leader Akhilesh’s emissary Kiranmoy Nanda came down to Kolkata in solidarity with Banerjee’s sit-in protest, a host of leaders including Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath, Delhi CMArvind Kejriwalspoke to her over the phone during the dharna expressing unity against the “one-man” show. The immediate takeaway for the opposition from the dharna is that the anti-Modi chorus grew stronger, and got heard across the country.“The sit-in protest has been a huge success,” said the TDP chief on Tuesday. “We have got national attention through this dharna. Even the NDA couldn’t ignore our voice. Democracy is in danger. This time it is even worse than the Emergency.” He announced that the opposition would come together whenever there is such an affront, and appealed to the people of Bengal to give all 42 Lok Sabha seats from Bengal to Banerjee."

As per the decision arrived at stakeholders’ meeting held in December 2018, M C Dathan, scientific adviser to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, and district collector K Vasuki were to visit the site on Monday.The decision to put off the site visit has been reportedly triggered by direction from state government that no action shall be taken at Peringamala until elections were held. It is also learnt that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is keen on getting results from a similar project being proposed in Kozhikode before it is emulated in other parts of the state. The pilot project is being implemented in KozhikodeThe members of the protest council had upheld the demand that district administration and authorities may first inspect the site before proceeding with the plan. The proposal had sparked off deep resentment among the residents of villages around Peringamala and the action council had undertaken mass processions demanding cancellation of the plan.Peringamala is one among the seven spots identified by state government for setting up the waste-to-energy plant. Unlike other spots, which have been earmarked for the project, Peringamala is an area of great ecological importance and marked by the presence of waterbodies and forests. The inhabitants in this area, who are hugely dependent on natural resources, have been on a protest mode ever since the announcement of the plan to set up the plant.While the state government is uncertain about Peringamala being the right choice for waste-to-energy plant using a new technology which has no precedents in the state, a section of top bureaucrats has been aggressively pushing for waste-to-energy models in the state.Sources said that the land survey will also be put on hold. The district administration was earlier directed to carry out a drone survey in the area but again it was cancelled, reportedly following the intervention of office of the chief minister.The drone survey was planned to assess the extent of land which could be used for setting up the plant and to study human settlements around the area.Officials with the department of agriculture said that they are yet to receive any official communication regarding transfer or utilization of land for other purposes.The farm area at Peringamala spreads over 120 acres of which 100 acres are owned by the department of agriculture and 20 acres have been taken on lease from department of forests for a period of 99 years.Around 300 families are scattered across various settlements like Pethalakarikkakom, Panniyottukadavu, Venkattamoodu, Adiparambu within 3km radius of Peringamala agri farm. The farm employs over 100 labourers from different panchayats.Sources said that LDF has come under pressure at Peringamala with protest mounting from all corners demanding cancellation of the project. The state government was recently forced to modify its order, which sanctioned 5MW waste-to-energy plants in the state, after no bids were received even after extending the date for submission in 2018. KSIDC, the implementing agency of the project had to revise the project structure."

Amidst tight police security and the presence of a large crowd of parents, the school management erected the four gates, despite protests by locals. At one stage, the situation even threatened to go out of control, but prudent handling of the situation by the police and administrative officials led to the warring parties arrive at a reconciliation over the contentious issues.Trouble began a few days back when a student suffered injuries after being hit by a motorcycle while playing on the school playground. This prompted the management to erect gates at all the four access points to the school. A few locals, however, resisted the move as they used the school playground as a shortcut.The management began the work Monday morning amidst the presence of a large number of parents.Sensing trouble, a large posse of policemen was deployed at the site to ensure law and order. Dy SP Uttam Raut Dessai, executive magistrate, Dattaraj Gauns Dessai, and police inspectors ofSanguem,Quepemand Curchorem, oversaw the situation. Despite loud protests from locals, led by councillor Piedade Diniz, the work was completed.An assurance given by the president of the school management, Pradip Kakodkar, that pedestrian access for locals would be allowed, failed to placate the agitated locals. Chief officer, CCMC, Kapil Phadte convened a meeting of the management with the local councillor and law enforcement agencies. A consensus solution finally emerged with the school management agreeing to deploy security guards at the gates round-the-clock, permitting pedestrian entry to local residents."

Even though the reservation policies exist, Indian academics is a space in which the deprived sections of the society have less access.

This is a tar road and patchwork had been done on it hardly six months ago.The contractor engaged mechanical excavators on the above-mentioned road and the site supervisor was seen overseeing the work. Asked for the reason for doing up a road that is better than other roads, the supervisor told TOI that the road has been taken up for laying white topping because “one needs existing base”. “We cannot work on a road that is in bad shape.”Leader of opposition in AMC, Zameer Quadri, Naser Siddiqui visited the site in evening and expressed shock over the “irresponsible” way in which the road work has been taken up.“There was no representative from theproject managementconsultancy, nor any civic official or official supervisor contractor was on the site. In a contradiction of what was told, there is no board giving schedule B information,” said Siddiqui, adding that substandard material was being used.Activist Rajendra Datey Patil said the decision of the civic chief to go ahead with the project while the matter is in court is wrong. “Great care should have been taken by the AMC before initiating the works as the matter is before the high court.”He said the high court has already issued notice to the AMC and the state government on the selection of roads under the project. “The petitions before the HC should be reviewed by the municipal commissioner.”The municipal commissioner is in Delhi and expected to return to Aurangabad on Tuesday, when the MIM is planning to register their objection with him then, said a corporator of the party.Vishranti Nagar resident Sunita Sagle expressed shock over the AMC’s action. “We have absolutely no road in our area since the residential colonies have come up. The condition is so bad that we have witnessed many incidents of serious injuries due to accidents in the locality. How can the civic body choose to spend the fund on recently repaired road,” she asked.Bhavsingpura resident Sanjay Kale said that apart from inconvenience for daily commute, the lack of proper road infrastructure in his area leads to problems when an emergency patient has to be rushed to hospital. “We were looking forward to the Rs 100-crore road project but the latest development is disappointing,” he added."

He should not fall prey to such attempts,” he said.“Our government has fulfilled most of his demands. As far as the demands related to the Centre are concerned, we have briefed him about the government’s action. We also gave Anna a letter from the PMO and urged him to break his fast.

The reason for the cut in the service is alleged to be the proposed service between Surat and Sharjah. Passengers said that a city’s development should not be at the cost of another developing city.According to airport sources,Air India Expresswill cut two services for a week temporarily on Sunday and Tuesday effective from February 19 till March-end. As per a communique from the airlines to the Trichy airport authorities, IX614 SHJ/TRZ will not be operated on Mondays and Saturdays effective February 16 to March 30. The same way, IX 613 TRZ/SHJ will not be operated on Tuesdays and Sundays effective from February 17 to March 31.It was after a seven-year wait that Air India Express resumed the service in the sector on September 16 thanks to representations and recommendations from various quarters. Kuwait-Tamil Islamic Community (K-Tic) had also worked for it, said H Ubaidullah, an independent aviation analyst based in Trichy. “When the flight is being operated with good patronage, it is an injustice to cut it and divert it to another sector. Passengers from central districts have no other choice to reach Sharjah than this flight. The airline could have utilized any of the flights operated from Kozhikode, Kochi or Varanasi as these airports have multiple choices or alternative flights to Sharjah”, he opined.At a time when passengers from the central region have been demanding new flights and more services to Gulf countries, it was unfair to snatch the existing services and divert them to other destinations, said the president of Air, Rail and Road Travellers’ Federation M Sekaran. “First they will say it will be a temporary one and then make it permanent. As we suspect some ulterior motive behind the move, we will not allow this,” he added."

However, after parents took up the matter with the districteducationdepartment, it swung into action and asked the school management to continue operating out of Sector 57 till the end of thissession.Parents were taken aback after reading the SMS late on Sunday night.

Mamata hosted a meeting of opposition parties at Kolkata in which most of the leaders of major political parties in the country participated.Narayanasamy was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the road safety week celebrations hefe. He said the BJP-led NDA government had been misusing the central agencies like the CBI, the income tax department and the enforcement directorate to target the leaders of the opposition parties.He charged that the central government had not probed the widespread complaints of corruption in states ruled by BJP and its allies earlier but started targeting the leaders of the opposition with complaints of corruption ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.He said the CBI of late had been facing corruption charges in the BJP regime. The issue has reached the doors of the Supreme Court. The government shunted out the CBI director, he said.Earlier in the day, Narayanasamy posted a tweet voicing his support to Mamata. “...clear case of political vendetta. BJP govt using CBI by filing false cases against officers. We all stand with #WestBengal CM. Time has come for Modi Govt to go,” he tweeted.Mamata launched a sit-in at Kolkata from Sunday against the CBI probe into the Ponzi scheme scam against Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar. A CBI team reached the commissioner's residence on Sunday to quiz on his reported involvement in the scam.

No major social agitation indicates it hasn't been jobless growth: Arun Jaitley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-major-social-agitation-indicates-it-hasnt-been-jobless-growth-arun-jaitley/articleshow/67816585.cms,"Business news, union budget,PM Modi,manmohan singh,loan waiver,Dassault Rafale,Arun Jaitley","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-67816586,imgsize-44617,width-400,resizemode-4/67816586.jpg","NEW YORK: Union MinisterArun JaitleySunday rejected criticism of giving a 'jobless economic growth', saying the absence of any major social or political agitation in the last five years indicates government schemes have created employment.In an interview to PTI, Jaitley, who is here for medical treatment, justified the absence of any major mention of job creation in the Interim Budget presented on February 1, saying such budgets are different from the normal budget speeches as they are more like ""a report card and a road map.""""Why is it that India, in the last five years, hasn't seen a major social or political agitation? If there is no job creation, there will be discontent. Where is that visible?"" he said.Rout of incumbent governments is a foregone conclusion when such discontent is there but during current times the opposition parties are teaming up because they know they do not stand a chance otherwise, he said.""Normally, outgoing governments in such environments, their rout is predicted. But today political rivals want to come together because they know for anyone of them it is not possible to take on Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi and his party,"" he said.Jaitley said it is not as if ""suddenly in five years the productivity levels in India have gone up that all organisations are now running with half their staff. The empirical evidence is to the contrary.""There is controversy over a leaked official report putting unemployment rate at a 45-year high in 2017-18.Jaitley also said questions are being raised as to how GDP increased after demonetisation, as reflected in the revision in economic growth numbers for 2017-18 fiscal.""I have been asserting from day one that it (GDP) has to increase after demonetisation. There was no settled global model on what happens post-demonetisation, there were no studies and therefore a former Prime Minister (Manmohan Singh) made a statement that there will be a 2 per cent drop. And everybody else accepted this as a prediction of a prophet of doom,"" he said.Demonetisation, he said, compelled people to deposit almost their entire cash, or 86 per cent of India's currency, into banks. This meant that many cash transactions that previously went unrecorded for the purposes of GDP came on record.""In the earlier eras, when we used to speak of parallel economy, one of the concerns was that the parallel economy doesn't reflect in the GDP. Therefore, when all were compelled to deposit 86 per cent of India's currency into the banks, and now had to use cheques and credit cards for the future payments, the number of digital and banking transactions increased.""He noted that money deposited in banks went to mutual funds, from there they were channelled to NBFCs, real estate sector, automobile purchase and more capital expenditure.""Transactions now emanating from that deposited money became recordable transactions. The anonymity attached to the owner of cash was gone. Now the owner of the cash was identified,"" he said.Jaitley, who was the finance minister when old 500 and 1000 rupee notes were scrapped overnight in November 2016, said except for a quarter or a little more, the long term impact of the move on GDP was visible due to the deposits being made in banks and more formalisation of the economy.""But since there was no global model, off the cuff statements were being taken as comfortable predictions. It was a bandwagon effect where everybody started speaking without thinking. And now the proof of the pudding is in the eating,"" he said.Former prime minister Manmohan Singh had previously stated that note ban had shaved off up to 2 per cent from the GDP growth because of closure of cash-dependent small and marginal businesses.Jaitley said the GDP estimates are only estimates but tax collections are real. ""Tax comes only if people earn more and spend more. If post-demonetisation, in the FY 16-17 and FY 17-18, your tax collections rise from 15 per cent to 18 per cent annually, more than the normal range, obviously this indicates an expansion of the economy,"" he said.India's net GDP increase in the last five years is estimated to have averaged 7.6 per cent.""That's real GDP. The nominal GDP will be 7.6 per cent plus inflation. This will take you closer to 12 per cent. If you have a 12 per cent annual nominal growth for five years, which compounded annually constitutes the fastest growth in five years in any global economy, forget economic principles, it defies even common sense of a lay citizen that a 70-75 per cent expansion in the economy doesn't create a single job,"" he averred.Asked about the 2019 general elections, he said, ""The agenda will be Modi vs chaos.""""We are already seeing two interesting factors. One - there are no real issues. Only fake issues are dug up. Rafale was the first fake issue.Loan waiverof 15 industrialists is the second fake issue. Not a single rupee of anyone has been waived. Third, the EVM is a fake issue.""So if the opposition has to rely on fake issues, it is issue-less,"" he said, adding there were multiple aspirants for prime ministership in the opposition grand alliance.Some of the aspirants, he said, have ""low level of understanding of public issues as the public discourse has shown and some have a scandalous record at governance.""""Eventually, India is a very alive and alert democracy, very aspirational society. So whether we want a government of an unknown ideology, an unknown leader or leaders who may scare people away from voting for them, or we want a tried and tested government which has taken India's governance to a different level. So the test is going to be Modi vs chaos and I think this is all converging in that direction,"" he said.The second choice people have to make is whether they want a five-year government or a six-month government because ""these non-ideological opportunistic coalitions don't have longevity"", he added."

The regional PWD office (NationalHighwaydivision) has written to the Chief Engineer in Mumbai to conduct an inquiry into the road quality.According to the agitators, the road project construction from Harsul to Baba Petrol Pump and Baba Petrol Pump to Chikalthana Airport is flawed on several parameters. Janhith Sanghatna activists alleged that the contractor and the officials were hand-in-glove.NGO President Imran Shaikh had written to the divisional commissioner asking for the formation of a committee to investigate the alleged irregularities. “We demand that no payments be made to the contractor until the report comes, a clean chit is given and a criminal offence should be registered against those found guilty of using sub-standard material or process. Until these demands are met, we will not stop the agitation,” he said.Speaking about the actual problems with the project undertaken 45 days ago, Nazir Shaikh, a road construction expert, said that the natural slope required to ensure that rainwater doesn’t accumulate on the road has not been provided. “The thickness is far from the standards with an uneven thickness of 2, 3 and 6 inches at different spots.

There are no plans for meetings with the UK government during this visit and he is not a guest of the government.”Qureshi will attend a conference “on issues in… Kashmir” in the House of Commons on Monday, which British MPs will also attend, and an exhibition on “human rights violations in Kashmir” on Tuesday. Both events are going ahead, despite the Indian government’s protests.A spokesman for the Pakistan high commission in London, which has organised the invite-only events, together with All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Pakistan, told TOI: “The Pakistan foreign minister will be attending a conference on Monday on Kashmir and an exhibition on Kashmir at the InterContinental hotel Park Lane on Tuesday.”The high commission refused to divulge any more details about either event and confirmed no meetings were planned with the UK government.

Guaido declared himself Venezuela's legitimate ruler on Jan. 23, and has the support of Washington and most South American nations.Speaking from behind a podium decorated with Venezuela's presidential seal, Guaido told supporters he would keep his opposition movement in the streets until Maduro stopped ""usurping"" the presidency and agreed to a presidential election overseen by international observers. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Venezuelans joined opposition protests against Maduro in Caracas and other cities.Guaido called on ""blocks"" of the military to defect from Maduro's administration and ""get on the side of the Venezuelan people.""""We don't just want you to stop shooting at protesters,"" Guaido said in a hoarse voice. ""We want you to be part of the reconstruction of Venezuela.""He said that in the coming days, the opposition would try to move humanitarian aid into the country by land and sea along three border points, including the Colombian city of Cucuta. He described the move as a ""test"" for Venezuela's armed forces, which will have to choose if they allow the much needed aid to pass, or if they instead obey the orders of Maduro's government.Maduro also dug in his heels, insisting he was the only president of Venezuela and describing Saturday's anti-government protests as part of a U.S.-led coup attempt.""I agree that the legislative power of the country be re-legitimized and that we hold free elections with guarantees, and the people choose a new National Assembly,"" Maduro said at a pro-government demonstration in Caracas.The opposition controls the National Assembly while government supporters control the more-powerful Constituent Assembly, so calls for a vote to replace the former and not the latter was seen as a move against Guaido.The socialist leader also had words for the administration of PresidentDonald Trumpwhich recently imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports in an effort to undermine Maduro's main source of income and weaken his grip on power.""Do you think you are the emperor of the world?"" he asked Trump. ""Do you think Venezuela is going to give up and obey your orders? We will not surrender.""The standoff comes amid what appears to be growing dissension among the ranks of Venezuela's powerful military.Earlier Saturday, aVenezuelan air forcegeneral defected from Maduro's administration and called on his compatriots to participate in protests against the socialist leader's rule.Gen. Francisco Yanez is the first high ranking officer to leave Maduro's government since Jan. 23, when Guaido declared himself the country's legitimate leader by invoking two articles of the Venezuelan constitution that he argues give him the right to assume presidential powers. He considers Maduro's election win fraudulent.In a YouTube video, Yanez described Maduro as a dictator and referred to Guaido as his president. He didn't say if he was still in Venezuela or had left the country.The officer confirmed in a phone call with The Associated Press, from a Colombian number, the veracity of his declaration and said he would not provide further statements until given authorization by ""the commander-in-chief of the legal armed force, which is President Juan Guaido.""The military controls some of Venezuela's key assets including the state run oil company, and until now, its top brass has helped Maduro to survive rounds of mass protests in 2014 and 2017 by jailing activists and repressing protesters.Yanez said in his video that ""90 percent of the military"" is against Maduro, but it is unclear how many will actively support the opposition.Shortly after protests broke out against Maduro last week, Venezuela's most important regional military commanders and its defense minister issued a statement in support of Maduro, describing Guaido as a coup monger backed by Washington.Venezuela's aerospace command of the armed forces shared a picture of Yanez on its Twitter account with the words ""traitor"" above it.""We reject the declarations made by General Yanez who betrayed his oath of loyalty to our nation and chose to follow foreign plans,"" the command wrote.On Saturday, Maduro said he was willing to sit down for talks with the opposition in an effort to promote national ""harmony.""But that offer has been rejected by Guaido, who describes it as a ploy by the Maduro administration to buy time.Previous talks between the government and opposition have failed to change electoral conditions in the South American country, and many political leaders have been forced into exile.At a pro-Maduro rally, supporters blamed the opposition for undermining theBolivarian Revolutionwith years of protests and seeking financial sanctions against the Venezuelan government.Zeleyka Muskus, a 53-year-old tax collector from Caracas, said the opposition was responsible for the country's current economic woes, saying they have staged years of protests that have gotten people injured and killed.""Chavez is the love of my life,"" she said, referring to late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.Other public workers attending the pro-government demonstration said they had been forced to go there by their bosses.Meanwhile, streams of marchers from middle-class and poor neighborhoods walked to another part of the capital and said they were demanding Maduro's resignation and a transitional government that would hold new presidential elections in the South American country.Xiomara Espinoza, 59, said she felt a change of energy in the crowd, whose hopes for a transition in Venezuela have previously been dashed.""We are around the corner from freedom,"" she said, banging on a pot and wearing a Venezuelan flag."

Besides, GST is being charged on products being used by farmers for agriculture.

The breakthrough came after the district magistrate gave them a written assurance to facilitate a meeting with chief minister Yogi Adityanath.The farmers, who were camping on one side of the DND flyway with tractors, tents, food, etc, insisted that they would not leave the spot despite repeated negotiations with the district magistrate and senior police officers. As many as 10 SHOs, 10 police companies—five each from both Noida and Delhi Police—DM, SSP, SP (crime), city magistrate, SP (traffic) and over 200 police officers reached the spot to ensure that the farmers don't march to the PMO.Delhi Police had lined up ahead of the toll in the Delhi area with tear gas and bomb disposal squads on their toes. In a symbolic protest, the farmers raised their hands tied with bands, stating that the administration wanted to “suppress” their protest and arrest them. After many negotiations, the farmers agreed to leave the spot by 3 pm, but only after the DM agreed to hand over a written document signed by himself to get meetings arranged between farmers and the chief minister as well as Yamuna Authority. They also sought a CBI probe into the land acquisitions that took place between 2008 and 2012 during the BSP rule. They questioned the land acquistion in Ghaziabad’s Kachaira village for the hi-tech city project, the one at Mandola village for a housing project, land acquired in villages in Yamuna Authority area and for the Gail India pipeline project in Bihar.The land of 18 villages in Ghaziabad including Kachaira, totalling nearly 4,500 acres, has been acquired for the hi-tech city project in January 2010 from the farmers by the Ghaziabad Development Authority.At least 19 PILs were filed by the farmers in Allahabad high court against the land acquisition, but officials said there was an adverse order in the matter. Farmer leader Manvir Teotia said the farmers were unaware of the exact legalities of the agreement and hence they lost the case in the court. “Our main demand is to check whether the acquisition process was legal or not. A CBI probe should be ordered for the land acquisition carried out during the BSP regime,” he said.The farmers also demanded that the Yamuna Authority hand over the compensation to the farmers affected by the land acquisition in villages like Mirzapur, Achepur and Niloni as per the Allahabad high court order in January last year. “Farmers have still not got the compensation for this acquisition,” Teotia said.“A meeting with the builder and farmers on the issue of Kachaira village will be arranged on Monday-Tuesday. A meeting of farmers from Bihar with Gail India officials will be arranged on Wednesday,” reads a written statement issued by the DM later on Saturday.Some 50 farmers from districts like Aurangabad, Sasaram, etc had come to demand enhanced compensation for the land acquired in 2013 for the 29 km pipeline project passing through four states. They finally left the spot around 3 pm.The farmers, however, made clear that in case the meetings are not arranged and their demands not met, they will return to the DND flywaywithin a week."

They said, “The students are at a loss with the new marking system and it would hamper their chance at admissions to first-year junior college against non-state board students.”The Sena leaders had recently led a signature campaign against the state board’s decision. With no response from the education department, they then decided to stage the protest on Thursday.The Maharashtra state board of secondary and higher secondary education (MSBSHSE) has implemented several changes in thesecondary school certificate(SSC, Standard X) examination’s marking patterns this year. The changes include scrapping the 20-mark oral examination, which according to the Yuva Sena is unfair towards the students.According to the new pattern, SSC students will now have an internal assessment for only two subjects — science and mathematics. The written examination for the language subjects and social sciences will hold the full 100 marks. The move was initiated by the state government last year after its officials noticed that students were being awarded nearly full marks by the schools for internal assessment.According to a TOI report on November 20, 2018, education experts and teachers said SSC students will be at a disadvantage against their counterparts from other boards and will not be evaluated for critical skills if the internal tests are scrapped."

Calling it insensitive and irresponsible act on part of district administration and hospital authority, the social worker says she intends to wake them up to truth to take action against those responsible and also get compensation for the bereaved families.According to Priyanka Shukla, a social worker, within hours after fire broke out in NICU ward of CIMS, the babies were rushed to district hospital, which lacks facilities for emergency cases in regards with newborn. After few hours again, the babies were shifted to private hospitals for further treatment but one by one, five of them died in past ten days.Though there were investigative committees formed by hospital management and district administration, it was concluded that none of the baby died of suffocation or inhaling smoke, instead they were anyway struggling for life at NICU and died during treatment.Priyanka said, “None of the post-mortem report was made public as an authenticity to prove the committees were telling truth, moreover, if at all it was because of short circuit that the fire broke out at NICU, why wasn’t any action taken for negligence over electricity management and fire safety system?”It was last year in March fire broke at CIMS but the management seems to have learnt no lesson. The striking advocate said that during her visit to CIMS, she found that there was no designated expert either for electricity and fire safety.“I sat for demonstration on Friday and it would be continued till the families of dead babies get justice. I demand for compensation to the families of Rs 5 lakh each and action against those responsible for negligence,” Shukla said.Talking to TOI,Chhattisgarhminister for health TS Singhdeo said, “There was a separate committee formed to check negligence on part of electricity department to investigate if there was overloading or any combustible material kept close to the electrical board. However, I will personally get the follow-up done to submit the report swiftly. Negligence can’t be tolerated in sensitive cases involving health of people or newborn and action is assured to be taken against the irresponsible ones.”Since I visited NICU at CIMS, I have been constantly feeling worried for the ailing newborn who are brought in fragile condition for treatment, he added. Hence, I am also planning to introduce some insurance cover or medical benefits for NICU patients via health department. Moreover, an electricity audit in all hospitals across the state has been announced and the process is underway, Singhdeo said adding that compensation would be given to bereaved families if negligence is found on hospital’s part.When the fire broke at NICU 22 newborn were admitted and taken outside and the reason for those died was stated as infection and that they were not responding to treatment and condition of nine of them remain critical. Questions were raised on the time loss of treatment while shifting babies to other hospitals, which were too critical for them and their recovery was on stake."

Locals of Tirumala, who have for generations been associated with the sacred abode of Lord Venkateswara and operate petty trades ranging from selling bangles, toys, and running roadside fast food joints, continue to live in constant insecurity because their survival at the hill shrine no longer depends upon His will, but is at the mercy of the all-powerful Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD).Unable to bear the neglect any more, the natives have now taken to the streets, demanding the state government and the TTD to resolve their long-pending demands. And their protests have drawn the support of not just opposition YSR Congress, Jana Sena and other political parties, but also of the ruling TDP.Most cities in the country have two sides — high-rise buildings and bungalows flaunting the riches and power of the high and mighty on one side, and the makeshift huts and slums, where the poor are forced to live in cramped spaces and suffocating proximity, on the other. Tirumala, the abode of Lord Venkateswara, is no different.Residential localities in the hill town like Balaji Nagar and RB Centre, to name a few, have been a classic case of neglect and showcase the deplorable living conditions of locals. Bad roads, irregular water and power supply, and unhygienic surroundings continue to worry locals each and every day, the whole year long. Adding salt to the wounds, their livelihood condition is day by day getting worse than their living condition. Local trade at Tirumala has been suffering as there is no uniform policy in place. There are numerous trade restrictions as well.Speaking to TOI, Tirumala Sthanikula Sankshema Sangham president S Jayakrishna alleged that local traders were being ‘fleeced’ by different departments of the TTD in the pretext of raids, and hefty penalties ranging from Rs 25,000 to Rs 1 lakh levied for minor violations.“The state government and the TTD have been magnanimous in spending hundreds of crores of rupees on the welfare of people of the state, as well as for visiting devotees from other states. But the same magnanimity is absent in the case of Tirumala locals who have been associated with the temple for several decades now. It is really unfortunate,” rues Muni Reddy, another local."

Moreover, their service can be terminated and contract will not be renewed in the future. In addition to this, different benefits provided to them by the state government can also be seized.”In his letter to CMOs, the state director said most of the demands of the health workers had been accepted, and thus, there was no logic in going on with the strike.District president of UP Rashtriya Swasthya Mission Samvida Karmchari Sangh Devendra Asthana on Thursday said, “We willintensifyour protest. The director is trying to distract the protesters from their resolve, but we are united and will continue to struggle for our rights.”“Around 20% of the health workers have not joined the strike inPilibhit, while another 15% have returned to their duties,” claimed CMO."
