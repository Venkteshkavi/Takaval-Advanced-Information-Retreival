Paris Police Chief Sacked After Champs-Elysees Rioting,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-police-michel-delpuech-chief-sacked-after-champs-elysees-rioting-2009577,The police's failure to keep the Paris protests from spiralling out of control over the weekend again cast a harsh spotlight on their tactics.,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-03/p7t9fe2o_paris-police-chief-michel-delpuech-afp-650_625x300_19_March_19.jpg,"The French government sacked the top police official in Paris on Monday following another weekend of rioting in the capital during ""yellow vest"" protests which have put President Emmanuel Macron on the defensive.The police's failure to keep the Paris protests from spiralling out of control over the weekend again cast a harsh spotlight on their tactics.About 5,000 police were deployed in the capital on Saturday, far outnumbering the several hundred black-clad rioters who caused havoc in front of groups of often passive policemen for more than seven hours on the famed Champs-Elysees.Business owners were left fuming Monday, as Macron cut short his skiing holiday to meet top ministers to discuss the 18th consecutive Saturday of""yellow vest"" demonstrations.""The events of last Saturday, in particular on the Champs-Elysees, were unacceptable and the president asked the government to provide a response that was up to the needs of the situation,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a televised statement.After criticising ""inappropriate"" instructions on the use of rubber bullets given to security forces, he announced that the head of Paris police, 66-year-old Michel Delpuech, had been fired and would be replaced on Wednesday.He said French authorities would ban rallies on the Champs-Elysees and elsewhere if hooligans were detected there, adding that fines would be increased from 38 to 135 euros for people attending unauthorised protests.While the public's safety remains a priority, ""the outburst of violence justifies a firm (police) response,"" Philippe told France 2 television on Monday evening.Numbers downMore than 100 businesses were damaged at the weekend in Paris including dozens of luxury shops and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees.Since the end of December, the number of ""yellow vest"" protesters has fallen, but each Saturday thousands still take to the streets, including far-right and far-left groups as well as anarchists who are responsible for much of the violence.A hard core of protesters have already vowed to cause havoc again next Saturday.""Every Sunday large cities across France wake up to the same old story: smouldering barricades and a strident declaration from Christophe Castaner,"" leftwing daily Liberation wrote Monday.Some have called for French police to be far more active in tackling troublemakers.""You have to take responsibility and engage, with the possibility that people will get hurt,"" said Frederic Lagache of the Alliance police union on Monday.For decades, French authorities have usually preferred the opposite, controlling mass protests with tear gas and rubber bullets while avoiding physical confrontation between police and large groups, experts say.Although some protesters have been injured by the rubber bullets, so far nobody has been killed in clashes with police, but officials say the risk would increase if officers charged the hostile crowds.""They would rather see a building damaged, with insurance companies footing the bill, than risk direct contact between police and demonstrators that might cause serious injuries or death,"" said Olivier Cahn at France's Cesdip law enforcement research institute.'Less reactive'But critics say the government needs to drastically rethink its approach for stamping out the rioting.""There are techniques and strategies for separating violent demonstrators from the others,"" Cahn said.""Germany has strategies for de-escalating the tensions and separating protesters that are quite effective.""Junior Interior Minister Laurent Nunez admitted on RTL radio on Monday that police ""were less aggressive, less reactive than usual"" over the weekend, promising a review of the instructions given to officers and their deployment.Castaner, a long-time ally of Macron who had no law-and-order experience before becoming interior minister in October, is also facing renewed scrutiny of his record amid calls for his resignation from some in the opposition Republicans party.While seen as too lax on Saturday, French authorities have been accused on other weekends of being too heavy-handed, highlighting the government's difficulty of managing the crisis.The UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet called for a ""full investigation"" into the possible use of excessive force by French police during the protests in an address on March 6.Since the demonstrations began on November 17, some 1,900 people have been hurt, including dozens who have suffered serious injuries from stun grenades or rubber bullets fired by police.Rights groups have tried to have the heavy rubber bullets used by the French police banned, noting that France is one of only a handful of Western countries to use them.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Indian Man Gets 5-Year Jail For Swinging Plank During Riot In Singapore,https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indian-man-yadwinder-singh-gets-5-years-in-jail-for-swinging-a-plank-during-riot-in-singapore-2011346,"The two groups of men wielded wooden poles, planks and belts, spilling onto the road and disrupting traffic, the court heard.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-03/qoq0gqlo_silat-sikh-road-temple_625x300_22_March_19.jpeg,"An Indian man on Friday was sentenced to five years jail and 12 strokes of the cane for swinging a plank during a riot involving about 60 people outside a Gurudwara in Singapore.Yadwinder Singh, 26, was the leader of one of the two groups of people who started fighting outside Silat Road Sikh Temple in Bukit Merah area in April, 2017, Channel News Asia reported.The two groups of men wielded wooden poles, planks and belts, spilling onto the road and disrupting traffic, the court heard.The court did not specify the reasons behind the fight.Footage from a public bus, played in court on Friday, showed Yadwinder swingingÂ a long wooden plank at members of the opposing group, the court heard.The court heard that Yadwinder and his group gathered at the bus stop outside the Gurudwara after prayers that morning.Some of them had armed themselves with wooden planks. They chased after the men from the opposing group, who were walking along Kampong Bahru Road after leaving the Gurudwara, shouting vulgarities at them before attacking them, the daily said.Men from both sides attacked each other with poles, planks and belts in the melee. Yadwinder was seen hitting two men with his wooden plank, injuring one man'sÂ scalp and face.After his arrest, Yadwinder plotted to leave Singapore illegally. He had already been jailed previously for rioting and unlawful assembly in 2016 and had committed this fresh offence while on remission. He was also on bail for another extortion offence.Two weeks before his trial for rioting began, Yadwinder made plans to leave the country illegally, paying a man SGD 4,000 to flee Singapore in the cargo hold of a bus.He carried out his plan in October 2018, after the first tranche of the trial, but was discovered by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at Tuas Checkpoint linking to southern Peninsular Malaysia.He was arrested, along with the bus driver on being found hiding in the cargo hold of the vehicle.After seeing how Yadwinder had been arrested for trying to leave Singapore, three men accused of being involved in the riot stopped turning up for the trial, the court heard. Arrest warrants were put out for them and they have been at large since.Yadwinder pleaded guilty after a five-day trial to rioting with a deadly weapon, failing to present travel documents upon departure and extortion with common intention.Two months before the riot, he and four others extorted SGD 200 from a 21-year-old Indian national, according to the Channel News Asia report. They threatened to report her to the public housing authority, Housing and Development Boar, for supposedly having more than the legal number of tenants in her flat.Yadwinder, who was unrepresented, was sentenced to jail for five years and five months, along with 12 strokes of the cane.District Judge Marvin Bay gave him an additional jail term of 129 days for committing a crime while on remission for earlier offences, the maximum possible for this case.According to a list prepared by Deputy Public Prosecutor Jason Chua, Yadwinder had been committing crimes repeatedly since 2015, three years after arriving in Singapore to work in construction.The judge granted Yadwinder 10 minutes to speak to his fiancee and friends who attended the hearing, as long as they ""maintained a certain civility"".All of Yadwinder's co-accused have been dealt with in court.

The Muzaffarnagar riots, one of the worst communal clashes in Uttar Pradesh's history, had led to the killings of 66 people and over 50,000 were displaced.The seven men -Muzammil, Mujassim, Furkan, Nadeem, Janangir, Afzal and Ikbal - were convicted for killing two men in Kawal village and rioting - by a local court in Muzaffarnagar on Wednesday.According to the police complaint, two men of Kawal village were battered to death by five of the seven convicts over a minor altercation. The two other accused, Afzal and Iqbal, were summoned by the court later under provisions of section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code when the evidence of their complicity in the killings emerged during the trial, reported news agency Press Trust of India.The clashes that broke out in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts after the two killings saw the deployment of the Army in the state for the first time in 20 years.More than 6,000 cases had been filed after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and nearly 1,500 people were arrested. The case, investigated by a Special Investigation Team or SIT, had filed 175 chargesheets.A probe into the riots had given a clean chit to the then Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh and blamed the local police and officials for misjudging and mishandling the situation.After the Yogi Adityanath government came to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, BJP leaders from western UP, some of whom are named in cases related to the Muzaffarnagar riots, approached the chief minister for withdrawal of cases against those who they say had been falsely implicated. The Yogi Adityanath government has moved to withdraw 38 cases so far, but those concerning BJP leaders continue to remain on track for now.With inputs from PTIGet the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.
