"Plans for Large-scale Terror Bombing, Ex-US Army Arrested","Rencanakan Teror Bom Skala Besar, Eks Tentara AS Ditangkap",https://news.detik.com/internasional/d-4531213/rencanakan-teror-bom-skala-besar-eks-tentara-as-ditangkap,id,"Mark Steven Domingo (FBI Courtesy / Handout via REUTERS) Los Angeles - A veteran of the United States (US) soldier was arrested because he was found planning a large-scale terror attack near Los Angeles. The attack was called an act of revenge for the terror of mosques in New Zealand, which killed 50 people in March. As reported by AFP on Tuesday (4/30/2019), Mark Steven Domingo (26) who has experience fighting in Afghanistan and a convert to Islam, was arrested by US authorities on Friday (26/4). Domingo was known to have served in Afghanistan between September 2012 and January 2013. He was threatened with being charged with terrorism-related charges for planning to detonate an improvised bomb (IED) at a white nationalist rally held last weekend on Long Beach, a one-hour drive from Los Angeles, California. Domingo&#39;s plan was called aimed at triggering many casualties. googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); Domingo was arrested after receiving a package which he thought contained a package of active homemade bombs, which contained nails. The package was delivered by an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent.

Domingo is also said to have expressed a desire to become a martyr by replying to attacks on Muslims. Local authorities said that after considering various options - including targeting Jews, the church and police personnel - Domingo decided to blow up an IED at the Long Beach rally that had been foiled. &quot;This investigation successfully disrupted the very real threat given by a trained combat soldier, who repeatedly stated he wanted to trigger the maximum death toll,&quot; US prosecutor Nick Hanna said in the court document. In a message to an online private group in early March, Domingo discussed the issue of the brutal shooting in Las Vegas which killed 58 people in 2017. &quot;America needs another Vegas incident ... it will make them feel the terror they will gladly spread throughout the world,&quot; Domingo wrote in the online message. Also read: US Word The issue of Al-Baghdadi&#39;s First Appearance in the Last 5 Years In another post, Domingo discussed the terror of two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand which killed 50 people and was carried out by an Australian man who worshiped white supremacy. &quot;There is a mosque shooting in New Zealand. There must be retaliation,&quot; Domingo wrote at the time. A few weeks after planning with an FBI informant in disguise and considering various targets, Domingo set a rally in Long Beach as a target. He bought hundreds of 7.6 cm nails that would be put into homemade bombs. Domingo was arrested after an FBI agent handed over an allegedly explosive package and both moved to Long Beach park to spy on the location of the attack. &quot;I am very pleased to announce that we are preventing a potential terrorist attack,&quot; said the Assistant Director of the FBI office in Los Angeles, Paul Delacourt. In this case, Domingo was charged with providing and attempting to provide material support for terrorism. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison if found guilty.

Understanding PKI&#39;s Excellence and PSI Failure,Memaknai Kegemilangan PKS dan Kegagalan PSI,https://news.detik.com/kolom/d-4530387/memaknai-kegemilangan-pks-dan-kegagalan-psi,id,"Jakarta - The results of the vote count version of the 2019 Election, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI) were equally shocking. Although the possibility will change, but the position of the voice is difficult to change on the results of the real count, because in its history in Indonesia the quick count in the election has never missed. PKS which has been predicted not to qualify for Senayan has succeeded in obtaining a figure of 8.56 percent, higher than the vote in the 2014 election, which is 6.79. Whereas PSI, which is considered to be a millennial, open and progressive party, which is predicted to obtain a significant vote, turns out to be &quot;clumsy&quot; and cannot deliver its candidates to Senayan because they only get 2.03 percent votes (Kompas Research and Development QC Data, 18/4). PKS and PSI have been seen as contesting political parties which are in two diametrically opposed points, both ideologically, politically, as well as support for vice-presidential candidates. During the campaign period, PSI showed a progressive face, while PKS showed its conservatism. PSI, for example, expressly declares anti-polygamy, and PKS supports polygamy. However, PSI looks very careful in addressing the LGBT issue. Whereas PKS from the beginning was very hard on the issue. On the other hand, the PSI is also filled with young millennials who are not only progressive, but also fresh, intelligent, caring, and clean. Meanwhile, in many reports PKS appeared with a pockmarked face with several cases, such as corruption, one of its candidates who was caught cheating, molested his biological child, and so forth. The question is, why did the PKS vote get shot, while the PSI was down? Blessings of &quot;Noise&quot; The PKS mass base is militant people. The cadres are indeed educated with a regeneration system that really builds militancy. Their militancy has increased with the flutter of butterfly wings on SARA issues since the DKI Jakarta Election in 2017 until the 2019 Election. Solid and hard polarization in the lead-up to the presidential election between &quot;cebong&quot; and &quot;kampret&quot; also provided significant blessings in increasing PKS votes. The PKS mass which had previously been militant began to fade, flaring up again with the polarization and flapping of the SARA issue&#39;s wings. In addition, PKS cadres in each Prabowo-Sandi pair campaign always smartly up front make convincing impressions and steal the attention of the masses. The issues of Islamic populism and the unity of Muslims in dealing with external threats are always used as weapons to consolidate their mass. With experience in political contestation since before the Reformation era, PKS actually had its &quot;ideological home&quot;. The urgency or rather &quot;noise&quot; caused by the &quot;flood&quot; of the SARA issue ahead of the 2019 presidential election made PKS sympathizers &quot;go home&quot; to their ideological homes. Fundamentalist Islamists, modernist Islam, right Islam, and political Islam such as HTI and so on will certainly run into the PKS &quot;ideology house,&quot; because PKS is the party that is at least ideologically close to them compared to other parties. Polygamy Blunder Meanwhile, PSI still does not have an &quot;ideological home&quot; that is &quot;as definitive&quot; as the PKS, apart from the fact that the ages of these two political parties are far apart. PSI can be said to still be in the form of search. PSI is also the hardest and most open party in criticizing Prabowo-Sandi couples, such as when PSI wants to give a &quot;Lie Award&quot; for Prabowo-Sandi. Therefore, it can be said that there could not be sympathizers of Prabowo-Sandi who would sympathize with the PSI. In addition, PSI is so expressive in expressing its progressive and even &quot;flirtatious&quot; thoughts. As a group of young people, the campaign presented by PSI is very compatible with all social media platforms which are millennial &quot;hangouts&quot;. So, whatever is delivered will be very fast and viral. One of PSI&#39;s flirtatious thoughts that was massive, so viral was an anti-polygamy campaign. Perhaps this was done by the PSI to attract sympathy from famous militant mothers and mothers in campaigning for the entity or political currents it followed. So far, the issue of anti-polygamy has always been juxtaposed with the narrative of partiality to women. Because, in polygamy women are always the victims of violence, both physical and psychological violence. However, this standing position of the anti-polygamy of the PSI has become a blunder and counterproductive for efforts to expand sympathy towards the PSI when the issue of polygamy is said to be part of Islamic law, or at least, permitted by Islamic law. Prohibiting something permitted by Islamic law is the same as violating even opposing Islamic law. And this narrative is always echoed by PSI&#39;s political enemies. The results can be said to be effective: there are many perceptions that PSI is a political party anti-Islamic law, especially when added to the fact that PSI is explicitly and openly opposed to the enactment of sharia regulations. This is what made PSI not succeed in stealing sympathy from voters in the coalition of Jokowi-Ma&#39;ruf camps and Muslims in general.

The US vowed to track and defeat the ISIS leader. As reported by AFP on Tuesday (4/30/2019), the US Department of Foreign Affairs (Deplu) said the US-led coalition would continue to fight ISIS anywhere. &quot;For the sake of ensuring the perpetual defeat of these terrorists and so that the leaders of anyone who still survives will get the justice they deserve,&quot; a spokesman for the US State Department said in a statement. googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); Also read: ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Appears in the Latest Video In a video released through the network of ISIS media wings, Al-Furqan, on Monday (29/4) local time, Al-Baghdadi discussed the issue of ISIS&#39;s defeat in fighting in the region they were last in Baghouz, Syria at the end of last March. He also threatened to attack the defeat. The State Department spokesman added in his statement, US government analysts would &#39;review the video footage and we will submit it to the intelligence community to confirm its authenticity&#39;. Apart from the issue of the authenticity of the ISIS video, a spokesman for the US State Department confirmed that ISIS had been &#39;battered&#39;. &quot;ISIS&#39;s territorial defeat in Iraq and Syria is a strategy of destroying and psychological blows while ISIS witnessed what it called its caliphate collapsed, its leader was killed or fled from the battlefield and his savagery was exposed,&quot; said the spokesman.

As reported by Reuters, the US Central Intelligence Agency or the CIA has not commented on the video.

Building a New Post-Election Narrative,Membangun Narasi Baru Pasca Pemilu,https://news.detik.com/kolom/d-4530688/membangun-narasi-baru-pasca-pemilu,id,"Jakarta - Social media has a vital role in democracy. The content contained in social media has a great influence in filling in the discourse that occurs in the public space. This has a positive impact on the communication channel to revive democratic activities as a container for various different interests and cross each other. According to John C. Calhoun, public space should not be understood utopically as an impermeable space from the influence of other spaces in the wider community, including influences from the state. This explains that public space in democracy is inclusive. So as to enable and open the participation of all elements of society in the public space to use their rationality. However, it must be realized that society is not a network of well-organized institutions. Although Indonesia recognizes various umbrellas that shade and influence the community such as the two large organizations, namely Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, but the people below them cannot be strictly controlled through these institutions. googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); From the polarization of the strength of the 2019 Presidential Election that still leaves a polemic, the community which was initially shaded by the two large organizations moves irregularly or is not based on political impulses that can be read during elections. Not all communities sheltered by one organization such as NU also supported the presidential candidate 01, even though there was Kiai Ma&#39;ruf Amin and how the majority of NU leaders tried to mobilize time to support the pair 01. This consciously made democracy move toward a better direction because people determine their choices based on their criteria and interests without being able to be intervened by the organization that shelves them. However, on a different side the post-election turmoil shows signs that can lead people to chaos because polarization becomes two big competing forces. Social media is now flooded with various suspicions and unilateral claims for victory. Feeling skeptical about the functioning of institutions such as the KPU is indeed felt necessary. However, skeptics who were dominated by an &quot;insistent&quot; attitude towards a victory were actually a symptom of immaturity in reviving democracy. Claims of victory from both parties at some point can be accepted as democratic inclusiveness to accommodate the various streams of mass communication. But at some point democracy can at times kill itself. This happens if the narrative created in public space is a narrative that emphasizes physical and violent. The official announcement from the KPU regarding the election candidate winner will be held on May 22, while the noisy commotion after the presidential election does not show a decline. Therefore, considering that in front of us there is a sacred moment for the majority of Muslims, namely fasting, it is necessary to watch out for possible interpretations of crossing communities. Fasting can be interpreted as a gateway to self-purification, so the agenda of forgiving and accepting victory and defeat can work well. However, besides that fasting is actually used as a moment of struggle for self towards goodness. This does not rule out the possibility of jihad or war narratives that fill the past campaign agenda to defend and fight for each other&#39;s choices. So, the second possibility becomes something that is actually dangerous for the life of our democracy which is still in the process of looking for its identity. Therefore, the political forces that are competing, as well as various influential figures and organizations need to jointly build a commitment to maintain peace in the public space so as not to create a mass explosion that will destroy the nation and state. One thing that can be done is by campaigning for the narrative of peace and acceptance.

Indonesian Special Volume Election (1),Pemilu Borongan Khas Indonesia (1),https://news.detik.com/kolom/d-4529237/pemilu-borongan-khas-indonesia-1,id,"Jakarta - Sad and concerned about reading the news 145 election officials died and 500 others were hospitalized due to fatigue. Only in this country there are many election victims, not by violent conflicts, but by systems and management. I remember how the Constitutional Court (MK) made a ruling: first, the separation of presidential elections from legislative elections violated the constitution; secondly, the presidential election and legislative elections were held together in the 2019 election. The order was stated in the Constitutional Court Decision No. 14 / PUU-XI / 2013 dated January 24, 2014. As we know, the plaintiff of the case was Effendi Gazali, a political communication expert who taught at the Faculty Social and Political Sciences of the University of Indonesia. In the claim file Effendi called his work: artists / activists. googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); He sued Law No. 42/2008 concerning the Election of the President and Vice President, specifically Article 3 paragraph (5), Article 9, Article 12 paragraph (1) and paragraph (2), Article 14 paragraph (2), and Article 112. According to him , the provision is contrary to Article 6A paragraph (2), Article 28 D paragraph (1), Article 22 E paragraph (1), and paragraph (2) of the 1945 Constitution. A few weeks before submitting a claim file to the Constitutional Court, Effendi contacted me. He asked me to become an expert in the trial to strengthen his lawsuit. I initially objected, because I rejected the idea of uniting presidential and legislative elections. I chose the format of the national (simultaneous) election and regional (simultaneous) election. Since 2006, I, as Chair of Perludem, together with Prof. Ramlan Surbakti (Airlangga University Social Sciences), Prof. Syamsudin Haris (LIPI), and Pipit Kartawijaya (KIPP Germany) have publicly campaigned for such a model of electoral merger. National elections to elect the president and vice president, members of the DPR, as well as DPD members. Voters get three types of ballots when entering the voting booth. Whereas regional elections to elect governors and deputy governors, members of the provincial DPRD, regents / mayors and deputy regents / deputy mayors, as well as members of district / city DPRDs. Voters get four ballots when they enter the voting booth. But Effendi continued to ensure the importance of my presence as an expert in the trial at the Constitutional Court later. He said, he used my writing Which Concurrent Election? at rumahpemilu.org as a reference for filing a lawsuit. &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t want to attend, my lawsuit will immediately fall,&quot; said Effendi jokingly exaggerating me. Yes, his name is also doing persuasion. I said that if your lawsuit is granted so that the presidential election and legislative elections are carried out simultaneously, then there are many political and technical implications. Politically, such elections cannot mature political parties because the party is only valued by the people within five years. Too long, even though we are a forgetful nation. Technically, the combination of presidential and legislative elections, the volume is so large, that it not only complicates the voters in choosing candidates, but also puts a heavy burden on the organizers. But that&#39;s where Effendi&#39;s ingenuity arose. &quot;That is precisely the case, Mas. If you give information from experts, you can explain at length about the importance of elections being divided into national elections and local elections. Did you know that the lawmakers did not understand. So the way the Constitutional Court must be taken . &quot; According to Effendi, national elections and regional elections are the ideal choice. But if the choice is not immediately realized, at least the synchronization of the presidential election and legislative elections will be able to overcome divided government at the national level. &quot;Yes, gradually. We take care of the national level first, then later to the regions,&quot; he said. Thus, I began to soften, although I was still worried. I am not sure the MK will consider my statement. Based on personal experience and colleagues, the Constitutional Court judges pay more attention to the statements of Constitutional Law experts rather than political and election experts. They tend to ignore political theories, election technical formulas, as well as new findings from election researchers. But anyway, a glimmer of hope exerted by Effendi Gazali should not be missed. Moreover, Effendi then issued his deadly stance, &quot;If it&#39;s not Educate, who else can explain the importance of national elections and local elections before the Constitutional Court? Did you have written a lot about that?&quot; Thus finally I expressed willingness to fulfill Effendi Gazali&#39;s request to provide expert testimony at the Constitutional Court&#39;s hearing on the lawsuit filed. Besides me, I appeared Irman Putra Sidin, Hamdi Muluk, and Saldi Isra&#39;s written statement. The trial was actually short. Because it only shows these three experts, the government and the House of Representatives are always legislators. However, the process takes one year. Effendi Gazali submitted a lawsuit file on January 10, 2013, and the Court issued a verdict on January 23, 2014. And sure enough, my worries came true. The Constitutional Court stated that the separation of presidential elections from legislative elections violated the constitution, so that the two types of elections had to be organized in the 2019 Election. The 2014 election was held separately, because the electoral process was already underway. Reading the verdict, imagine how complicated the implementation of the 2019 Election will be. &quot;This is an election election,&quot; said Prof. Ramlan Surbakti. As with bulk work, the process and results are definitely not good. Workers often become victims because they have to work day and night, are limited in time and chased by the foreman.

Heavier penalties are expected to cause deterrent effects for the community. &quot;If the number of years is left to the agreement process in the DPR but that in principle is as religious leaders and community leaders, they need to get greater punishment to cause deterrent effects as well as the deterrent effect to the wider community. the victim, yes, &quot;said Secretary General of the PBNU Family Benefit Agency, Alissa Wahid, when contacted on Sunday (4/29/2019) night.

However, the influence will have a major impact if the religious leaders become perpetrators of rape. &quot;But if a religious leader, when he has a social influence, that when he does he can give normalization. This means that other people then assume, may. Because the role model is, religious leaders,&quot; he said. Also read: PKS Bill: Religious Leaders Who Raped Minimum of 12 Years in Prison! In addition, Alissa continued, religious leaders who were perpetrators of rape had a greater effect on victims. Heavier penalties for religious leaders are considered as a form of defense for victims. &quot;His influence on the potential victim himself or the victim precisely, is much greater. The victim is more helpless when it forces him to have sexual relations with the religious leader. So that is what causes religious figures to get extra punishment and also because of deterrent effects &quot;he added. Alissa then conveyed the rules of fiqh proposal which meant preventing damage was preferred rather than getting serious. In the context of sexual violence, Alissa argued that the damage carried out by a religious leader would have a greater impact so it needed to be prevented from the start. &quot;If in NU the clerics always use the fiqh rules, the sentence darul mafasid, the muqoddam ala jalbil masolih, prevents damage, is prioritized rather than getting good. So the damage caused by a religious leader is much greater,&quot; he said.
