Tran Aadi Liti is a laugh riot on friendship and art,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/gujarati/theatre/tran-aadi-liti-is-a-laugh-riot-on-friendship-and-art/articleshow/68371010.cms,"Yash Soni,tran aadi liti,theatre,play,Gujarati,Drama,art",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.comNone,"Theatre ReviewDirector: Henil GandhiDuration: 1 hour 20 minutesCast: Yash Soni, Kishan Gadhavi, Pratik RathodRating: 2.5 starsWhat happens when ego and everyday reality of life come between friends? How well our friends adapt to our constant evolution and outlook towards life? These are the questions that the sixth show ofTran Aadi Liti, aGujaratiminimalistic and verbose comedydramathat was staged at the Ouroboros Art Hub Blackbox Theatre in Ahmedabad recently evoked among the audience.Directed by Henil Gandhi and written by Keka Mehta, the all-male youth oriented niche play has been adapted for the fun-loving Gujarati audience from a French play titled Art by Yasmin Raza.The first scene opens with a narration of how a painting having only three lines has been bought for `5 crore by Hemang (played by Yash Soni) and has led to a faceoff between him and his childhood friend Aakash (Pratik Rathod) even as their friend Vishal (Kishan Gadhavi) tries to mediate. Vishal tells Hemang that he likes the painting just to make him happy but instead draws wrath from Aakash. The play is a fun take on the lies we tell our friends often putting them in a tight position and the leg-pulling that goes in between along with the remarks on wedding venue that every host family has to hear from relatives even as the bride pronounces a Sabyasachi lehenga assaagbhajilehenga.While Yash is convincing in his role of Hemang as a divorced doctor and a passionate art collector, Pratik’s portrayal of the serious minded no-nonsense attitude role of Aakash makes you wonder about the hero and the anti-hero even as Kishan steals the show as he makes you laugh with his portrayal of confused saree salesman Vishal facing pre-marital anxiety. The hand sanitiser using, pill popping role of Aakash stays with you even as Hemang gets personal and blames Aakash’s female friend for his OCD.The realistic play has a suggestive set and lights have been mindfully used by Nisarg Purohit in each character’s brief monologue at the start and the end. It would have been a better experience for the around 100 audience had there not been long pauses in switching from one scene to the other and the actors had used a mike.However, on dialogues likesab moh maya haiandmaara pota vala no lagan e vaadi me thatu ayu hai to shu, mari bayari ke chhe ena mota saga vala tya nath aayemakes the audience erupt into bouts of laughter.Still, the comical satire on modern art, astrology, yoga, societal expectations and marriage stays true to entertainment while striking a chord with themamra-loving Amdavadi audience that loves to eat out at a fancy restaurant while blaming the ‘dry state’.Watch it for a hearty laugh with your friends."

The court observed that the violence, which was an outcome of a mob protesting a murder, stemmed from an unlawful assembly that adopted non-peaceful means to protest.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Samar Vishal had no doubt that the assembly was unlawful as it caused traffic jam, besides indulging in violence, as part of a common intention. “Prosecution has proved all the three accused to be members of unlawful assembly and being involved in assaulting the police personnel,” the judge noted.The court held that Jarwal, Salim and Dharam Prakash were part of the assembly and assaulted police constables and an assistant sub-inspector. Besides, the violence also resulted in damage of a DTC bus and a few motorbikes. The three accused, therefore, were held guilty under the relevant provision of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.The incident took place on August 30, 2013 when a mob of about 300 persons resorted to stone pelting. The protest was in retaliation to a murder and supposed inaction on the police’s part. A few members of the mob were allegedly provoking the rest to resort to violence. The mob, according to the case, did not pay heed to the police’s appeal to maintain peace, instead ripped off their uniform.Jarwal claimed innocence and took the plea of alibi saying he was not present at the crime scene, but attending to people’s queries at office. He also submitted that it was a political conspiracy against him to defame his image. Akin to Jarwal, the others, too, raised the plea of alibi.The court, however, found no reasons to discredit prosecution witnesses when the defense raised none. Besides, there was no delay in the registration of FIR and the names of accused had figured in the initial complaint itself. “They have been identified by the witnesses as being on the spot,” the court held.Arguments on the quantum of punishment will be heard on March 13."

The theme of this year’s event was the flower Antirrhinum, and visitors were greeted by the same as soon as they entered the show. According to Noida Authority officials, the show has been a platform for many firsts. “For the first time, the Noida Flower Show is being promoted on social media. For the first time, a photography competition has also been organised here. Again, for the first time, the flower show will have drone surveillance as well,” said Rajiv Tyagi, General Manager, Noida Authority.Centerpieces become selfie pointsThe first flower display in the middle of the show was an homage to martyred CRPF soldiers. Other displays included colourful flowers arranged in the form of a waterfall, peacock, elephant and other animals, and drew many children and selfie-clicking youngsters. “It is a bright, sunny day and colourful flowers make for a perfect picture. We read about the show in the newspaper today and decided to spend the evening here,” said Vishwendra Singh, a visitor at the flower show.Paths made with stones led to the entrance of several small parks – that were scattered around the venue – adorned with colourful flowers and wooden decorative items like a little hut, dwarfs, gnomes and even swings! “The miniature parks are made to attract curiosity among people and to show how parks are supposed to be, provided we maintain them. Planting bright and colourful flowers and taking care of them should be a community effort and that is what we want to teach people here,” said Manish Kumar, from theFloricultureDepartment of Noida Authority.Flower entries from around 20 different participants like Northern Railway, Hans Raj College, South and North Delhi Municipal Corporation and many others were alsodisplayed at the show.The Noida Authority displayed how waste – including old water bottles, tyres and jeans – can be used to make decorative plantersWaste-to-decor section floors visitorsTaking a cue from the under-construction Shilp Haat in Sector 33, the Noida Authority displayed how waste – including old water bottles, tyres and jeans – can be used in the form of decorative planters and as solar huts too. The section also featured small fountains and a number of showpieces of aquatic animals and insects. “The wood used here is the waste wood which is acquired from factories like LG and Samsung where it is used for packaging and then discarded. We have created a solar hut that has asolar panelon one side and a vertical garden on the other. All this will be displayed at the Shilp Haat once the flower show is over,” said Tyagi.“Everywhere we look, there is some everyday item which has been used in a unique way. This has inspired me to follow suit. Old clothes have also been used here, which I’ve not seen before,” said Sarika Rawat, a visitor and resident of Sector 55.The stall sellingbonsaiplants was a crowd-pleaser, and also had a penjing display at the backBonsai-making and Pejing at the showThe stall selling bonsai plants was a crowd-pleaser, and also had a penjing display at the back. “Penjing is a form of scenery display through the use of stones and plants, which give the effect of mountains and trees in your own home,” said Saumik Das, the stall owner.The average height of the bonsai plants ranged between one and three feet, and the oldest one was a 57-year-old bonsai of a Banyan tree. “I am very fascinated by these plants and have bought two of these for my home. I also enquired about how to make these and found that I can sign up for bonsai-making classes as well,” said Ruchika Mehra, a resident of Sector 25.Compost-makingApart from stalls selling plants, planters and gardening equipment, one exhibit which garnered people’s attention was that of the compost-making setup for apartments.Compostgeneration through the use of permeable trays was being demonstrated to promote waste management.“Earlier, our grandmothers used to make compost in the backyard. However, flats don’t allow for this. so we’ve created a system through which the kitchen waste from the apartment of a family of four can be converted into compost within one month, which can be further used for gardening,” said Brig Amrit Kapur, from Citizens Environment Improvement Society.The demonstration generated interest among people as awareness regarding waste management has become paramount in the recent times. “I always thought that in order to make compost without a proper backyard, we need those machines which are available in the market. However, this system of using simple trays with some red worms is not just easy but cost-effective as well,” said Rita Mahajan, a resident of Sector 70.Air purifying, herbal plantsAlmost every stall at the flower show was banking on the popularity of air purifying plants which are in high demand considering the low air quality of the city. “Air purifying plants have always been in demand and will continue to be so because they can be put indoors and don’t require much care,” said Simmi, another stall owner.Herbal plants – especially basil, thyme and rosemary – were also selling like hot cakes at the flower show. “I watch a lot of European cooking shows and keep experimenting with my own food as well. We cannot always rely on the dried herbs which are available in the supermarket because the flavours that the fresh herbs emit is unmatchable. I had been looking for these type of potted herbs for a while now but ultimately found them at the flower show,” said Ranjana Kakkar, a resident of Indirapuram.Visitors clicked selfies with the flower displays that resembled animalsStreet Play, photography contestApart from plant lovers at the event, some photography enthusiasts were also seen clicking pictures of the various kinds of flowers and plants on display at the show. “I love clicking nature and what better place to click bright, colourful flowers than the Noida Flower Show?

""It is quite surprising that after 1984 riots, no government did bother to touch the issue of mass killing of Sikhs in the city, and whatever they did, was just an eyewash, as later almost all the accused involved in the killings were given a clean chit"", Aulakh said. The SIT would probe the role of all accused in the riots who had been given clean chit by the previous state goverments, and if found guilty, would be punished, he added.The members of the Sikh community now hope to get justice after 34 years of the genocide, Aulakh claimed. ""The BJP-led state government is committed to provide justice to the 1984 riot victims who had lost their kin"", he said.Lauding the efforts of chief ministerYogi Adityanathfor ordering an inquiry by the SIT in 1984 riots, Aulakh said, ""Please don't connect it with the forthcomingLok Sabhaelections. We are just following instructions of the apex court which had sought information and the status of various cases related with the riots.""He said Kanpur was the second city after Delhi where large number of Sikhs were killed following assassination of former PMIndira Gandhiin 1984. When asked why the government is not considering to give a proper financial package to Sikhs as most of the riot accused are not alive, Aulakh said, ""the financial package is different, and giving justice to those who had lost their kin was something else.

Rather than looking into the overall political climate and actions of the mob, the author takes a detailed and analytical look into the individuals that were a part of the Godhra genocide. Laul explains it from the point of view of those in Gujarat, giving us the story and backstory of people from every stratum of society who were affected by the riot. The author is a journalist who interviewed several of those who participated or were impacted by the riots before writing the book. An important book, especially published just prior to the 2019 general elections,The Anatomy of Hateis filled with true accounts that will not only inform readers, but seek to shed new light into the national issue of a mass massacre.The focus of the book is on three main characters (names changed)-- an aggressive Hindu who is very proactive in the local branch of the RSS named Suresh; Dungar, an intelligent tribal man who was always shamed for his caste though he tried to rise above it; and Pranav, a well educated college student who was exposed to riots only from the news he'd get at college and the trips he took t around the town. The author interweaves stories of others into the main narrative so the reader is given an in-depth view of the characters involved. It humanises the mob by showing it's constituent individuals and telling us about how their lives led to that pivotal moment.The book starts by describing some nasty scenes of the riots and introduces the three main characters. Following the introduction, the book is divided into three sections: Before, The Twenty-Eighth Again, and After. In the first section she describes the lives of the characters from childhood; in the second, she briefly touches on the riot; and the final section describes the aftermath of the horrible day.

Mamata: BJP destroying India by promoting riots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mamata-bjp-destroying-india-by-promoting-riots/articleshow/67812987.cms,"Kolkata news, Kolkata latest news, Kolkata news live, Kolkata news today, Today news Kolkata, Mamata",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//static.toiimg.com/photo/34824568.cms,"Kolkata: Chief ministerMamataBanerjee on Saturday reacted sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s jibe on “her fear for CBI and ED”, saying it was the pot calling the kettle black (chalon kina chhucher dosh dhore).“His political career started with Godhra riots. What happened to Haren Pandya? Victims of the 2002 riots have not got justice. He lacks humanity and compassion. I feel ashamed,” Banerjee said. “Just because he was questioned by CBI, everyone else has to be questioned too? His role in the riots was a known fact, hence he was questioned.”Saying that chit funds were created in the 1980s, the CM hit back: “Why was no action taken till 2011? They have destroyed the country in the last four years. We do not need their lectures.”Responding to the syndicate barb, Banerjee said: “He himself runs a syndicate of agencies. If it is about syndicate, he himself should be at the top of the top. People are tired of riot syndicate, lynch-ing syndicate, gau rakshak syndicate. He is the leader of syndicate of the agencies. The death knell of his government has been sounded. The expiry date of the Modi gove-rnment is here. He has ruled for five years with the help of CBI, IT and ED. They orchestrated riots and killed people.”“I respected Atalji. But many current leaders of BJP are not worthy of respect. BJP is destroying the country by promoting riots and violence. Democracy is under threat. Agencies are being misused. Political opponents are being targeted,” she said.The Bengal chief minister attacked the government for “destroying the economy with demonetisation and hurried implementation of GST”. “This is a fascist government. He has no courtesy. He does not know the way a PM must speak. His arrogance will soon end,” she said.“The opposition parties have one aim — ‘Modi hatao, desh bachao’. We organised the United India rally. Does he have any allies left? He is busy with his own fashion. He even reads his speeches from a teleprompter. He is good for nothing. He promised to bring back black money. We are in power. They are on their way out. They are bringing leade-rs from all over India to address rallies in Bengal. Had they given even a portion of this money to Bengal, people would have benefitted.”Taking a hard stance against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, Banerjee said: “They want us to pass the Citizenship bill. They are driving Bengalis out. Biharis and Nepalis are also being pe-rsecuted. Nearly 22 lakh Bengalis have been left out of NRC. We will not allow them to incite riots, we will not allow northeastern states to burn, we will not allow sectarian violence. They have to withdraw the bill.”She added: “Twelve thousand farmers have committed suicide during the Narendra Modi regime in India. Demonetisation is a big scam. Jan Dhan is a big scam. Rafale is a big scam. Bengal has withdrawn from Ayushmaan Bharat. Health is a state subject. So are education and agriculture. We have our Swasthya Sathi scheme. Healthcare is free in Bengal. They only speak about welfare of people during elections. They are copying our schemes, but faili-ng miserably while implementing them. For example, the budget of Beti Bachao per state is Rs 3-4 crore. The budget for Kanyashree scheme in Bengal is Rs 7,000 crore. The Centre promised that they will double farmers’ income by 2022. We have already tripled farmers’ income. We have waived khajna tax on agricultural land. We have started a new Krishak Bandhu scheme. What has he done for farmers and labourers?”“Bengal has been depriv-ed. No new trains have been allocated to the state. The new announcement on tax relief is also a hoax. The devil lies in the details. They know they will not remain in power. Hence, they are saying anything they want to. From the judiciary to the media, no one has been spared. What is the reason behind this arrogance? They are jealous of the progress of Bengal. Where were they when the state was suffering during Left rule? BJP and Left have become one. Don’t be surprised if participants at today’s rallies are seen at Brigade tomorrow.”"

The CBI has filed three closure reports in the case."

Thousands of Hindu Munnani cadres conducted a rally the next day to take the body to Thudiyalur from the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH).The petition said that HM functionaries used the funeral procession to create a riot-like situation. “They tried to get political gain by the riot. They damaged six vehicles of the police department, 34 buses, 39 shops belonging to Muslims, 15 shops belonging to Hindus and 10 private vehicles. They damaged properties worth about Rs 5crore.

Last year, the Supreme Court had ordered that political parties that conduct protests and rallies are responsible for the damages caused and compensation should be collected from them.

Since then, top SP leadership has avoided visiting there.SP chiefAkhilesh Yadavhad even stayed away from campaigning during theKairanaLok Sabha byelections last year, when RLD fielded its candidate against the BJP.RLD, with the support of SP and BSP, had defeated the BJP candidate, which was the third consecutive defeat of the BJP following the BSP-SP alliance supported by RLD.Now, as Lok Sabha elections near, SP is likely to take the same line and field less candidates in the region and allow BSP to have a larger chunk. With the support of RLD, the alliance is banking upon the powerful combination of Jat-Jatav-Muslims to give a stiff challenge to the BJP. Like BSP, RLD had also drawn a blank in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections after the Jats’ exodus to BJP.However, RLD leadership has worked hard over the last year and is seen to have substantially regained ground by raising agrarian issues. Another reason for SP to maintain a low profile is the thin presence of its committed votebank of Yadavs, whose presence here in west UP is negligible."

Tanikella Bharani’s Gardabhandam is a thought-provoking laugh riot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/hyderabad/tanikella-bharanis-gardabhandam-is-a-thought-provoking-laugh-riot/articleshow/67611703.cms,"Tanikella Bharani,seamless,samahaara,Rathna Shekar Reddy,Gardabhandam,classical music",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.comNone,"Plot: Written by noted actor-cum-playwrightTanikella Bharani,Gardabhandam(donkey’s egg) is a socio-political satire on the ills of monarchy and the caste system. The story revolves around a meek, foolhardy king of a mythical kingdom who blindly subscribes to the recommendations of his scheming minister, Amartyulu. The king is without an heir and in a bid to usurp the throne, Amartyulu convinces the monarch to perform a gardamedha yaagam for 11 days. The sly minister assures the king that on the 11th day, the donkey will lay an egg and a prince will grow out of it. Will the king perform the yaagam?Review:A compact script and witty dialogues are the strengths of this play. The way Tanikella Bharani effortlessly interspersed chaste Telugu with English words in the script speaks volumes about the playwright’s mastery in giving the classical plot a contemporary twist. DirectorRathna Shekar Reddydoes a commendable job in establishing the characters in a tight time frame of 45 minutes. Thanks to the capable cast, he managed to maintain the wittiness of the narration and left audience in splits throughout. The play’s transition from being a light-hearted comedy to a serious socio-political drama too wasseamless.In the acting department, Kiran, who played the role of the king’s messenger, was a treat to watch. With amusing stage antics and superb comic timing, he succeeded in maintaining the sharpness of the satire. Playing the docile and submissive king, Hemanth did a wonderful job in getting into the skin of his character with the right demeanour and meek dialogue delivery. His comical exchanges with Kiran were the highlights of the play. Charista too did a neat job with apt histrionics and spotless dialogue delivery. But it was Anurup Katari, who gripped the audience with his emotionally-charged monologue at the climax. Playing a commoner, who’s dissatisfied with the king’s rule, Anurup was spot on in expressing his outrage with sheer conviction.But it’s the light play and sound design where the play faltered. Considering the complexity and the wide range of emotions explored in the story, the stage lighting seemed too basic and underwhelming. The strong performances of the actors would have stood out more had there been props to establish a royal set. In the absence of a background score the dialogue-heavy narrative ended up seeming a little to verbose.Verdict:Samahaara’s Gardabhandam managed to put across a strong political message of why a nation needs a conscious ruler with a heavy dose of comedy. The play managed to strike a balance between thought-provoking content and sarcastic comedy. However, it lacked essentials such as a standard background score and appropriate light play to make a riveting theatrical experience."

According to the CM, such policies would continue to backfire on them, as it did in the assembly elections, subsequent by-elections and other elections in the state.On SAD president Sukhbir Badal’s statement alleging the involvement of the Gandhi family in the 1984 anti-Sikh violence, he said the Badals are using the riots to further their vested interests."

She wanted wanted to challenge the acquittal order before the HC on merits, but she was not granted permission to file an appeal.Another petitioner was a rape victim from Banaskantha district. Her stepfather was a complainant. a trial court acquitted the accused. The state government’s request to file appeal against acquittal was rejected. The victim felt that the prosecution was not proper and sought court’s permission to file an appeal against the acquittal. Since the HC had rejected state government’s request to file an appeal, it rejected the victim’s request too.Both the victims raise an important issue on what can a victim do when they are not aware of the outcome of criminal proceeding. This led a division bench to take a decision on provisions of law – Section 372 of the CrPC, particularly considering various judgments passed by the Supreme Court. The bench permitted both the victims of offences to file appeal directly without seeking HC’s permission.The HC ordered that “requisite sensitivity” should guide the cause of victims, for “victim has an absolute, independent, substantive right conferred upon it to prefer and appeal against the judgement and order of (i) acquittal (ii) conviction for lesser offence (iii) inadequate compensation.”The HC clarified that if the state government fails to convince the HC to permit it to file an appeal against lower court’s order, it “would not preclude the complainant of victim from preferring an appeal. Victims and the state government can independently file appeals without being dependent on the exercise of right by the other”.The HC cited the United Nation’s Declarations of basic principles of justice for victims of crimes and abusers of power, Malimath Committee and 154th Law Commission Report to say that such rights must be given their due primacy and recognition. “They also need not be merely on statute books without corresponding teeth to implement,” it said.The HC ordered for fine-tuning its docket system to implement this order. The trial courts have been ordered to mention all details of complainants/victims in their final orders. The trial court will also have to communicate the orders, even through electronic medium, to victims. In case of death or incapacity of victims, the courts will have to communicate their orders to victims’ relatives.The HC will have to issue notice to all complainants/victims of the crime when the state government or the accused file an appeal against the trial court order so that they can become party to the proceedings in the high court."

He said Modi had not only fast-tracked development and infrastructure in Punjab, but had also resolved long pending issues of the Sikh community.“Be it the investment of Rs 30,000 crore on creating a world class road network, to building new airports, sanctioning IIM at Amritsar and AIIMS at Bathinda, or releasing funds for the Shahpur Kandi dam, the NDA government has always kept Punjab first,” said Sukhbir, adding that previous Congress governments had always discriminated against Punjab and Punjabis.The former deputy CM alleged that the Congress government in the state Punjab backtracked from its pre-poll promises of agri loan waiver and betrayed the farmers. “Maize growers are suffering because the Punjab government has not come out with a compulsory procurement policy for this and other crops,” he said, while appealing for extending more support to farmers, farm labourers and small industry and trade.Praising Modi, Sukhbir said, “Steps taken by Modi government have already resulted in conviction of two persons in anti-Sikh riots case within one year. PM has had also fulfilled the ‘ardas’ of Nanak Naam Leva Sangat by deciding to establish a corridor from Indian territory inGurdaspur districtto Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan.

Of these 43 cases, 40 have already been detected.“Even some cases relating to attacks on migrants or the Patidar protests and film protests we have invoked the stringent dacoity section, and this may have bloated the figures,” Singh added.Singh said free and fair registration of cases is another factor behind the high numbers. “We registered each case of according to its legal definition and that is why the figures look inflated,” he added.Meanwhile, the crackdown on bootleggers and gambling den operators also reflect in the figures. From 1,027 cases of gambling in 2016, the number rose to 1,337 in 2017 and on to 1,610 for 11 months of 2018.Similarly, the number of prohibition cases also rose, going from 12,580 in 2016 to 14,954 in 2017 and on to 15,383 till November 2018.“This is the result of strict policing and the crackdown on the liquor mafia.

The number of rioters killed in clashes with security forces also declined by nearly half this year since 2016.However, rioting during counter-insurgency operations —stone-pelting and illegally entering cordoned-off combat zones — has become almost routine in the last three years. Casualties of rioters during such encounters went up by six times, from 6 in 2016 to 37 in 2018.The disruptions have turned out to be such a challenge for the security forces that Army chiefGeneralBipin Rawat sent out a strong warning to rioters in October this year. Stone-pelters disrupting the operations, he said, would be treated as overground workers (OGWs) of militants, if they did not desist from entering combat zones.“His statement stirred a controversy because besides the separatists, the mainstream political parties in Kashmir -- National Conference (NC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) once out of power — portray the rioting stone-pelters as ‘innocent civilians’,” a senior counter-insurgency specialist in J&K police said.Security analysts in the Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police say that though the phenomenon of rioters disrupting anti-terror operations in the Valley began at least six years ago, it intensified after Wani’s killing in 2016. In some cases, the rioters were able to rescue holed up militants from encounter sites.“The trend is a well-thought out strategy devised byPakistan. It is cost-effective sub-conventional warfare because terror groups get to use their sympathizers as human shields; the rioters get branded as innocent civilians and Indian soldiers as murderers; all of this evokes outrage, more youth come out to riot and clash with forces during the encounters and more get killed in an unending loop,” an officer in the northern command said.A 25-year-old former stone-pelter in Kulgam, who did not want to be named, told TOI on phone that there was social sanction for rioting and stone-pelting during encounters. “Infuriated youth believe it is their religious duty to protect the lives ofmujahideenwho are out there to fight for them,” he said.As per data, terror attacks in Kashmir increased one-and-a-half times, with 390 incidents this year. Terrorists came down heavily both on civilians and forces in 2018, marking the highest number of killings —84-- this year in the last six years. However, security forces also killed a record number of militants — 242-- the highest since 2008. Most of the terror attacks and civilian causalities remain concentrated in three districts--Pulwama, Kulgam and Shopian, official sources said."

In fact, it is seen that the respondent has not even furnished any reasonable justification for such complete inaction,"" he said.In a stern observation, Julka said the issue raised by Bhardwaj involves larger public interest and thus the conduct of the public information officer (PIO) of the MHA is found ""totally unacceptable"".The ""unexplained, unreasoned but consistent"" approach of the respondent of shirking their role as custodian of information, and casual approach of the PIO is defeating the purpose of transparency and administration of the RTI regime, he observed.He directed the Home Secretary to depute a senior official to look into the issue and submit a detailed report within 15 days carrying specific details like complete status of the 13 reports and reasons for them not being uploaded on the web site.It should also contain who is the actual custodian of these reports, why application was not transferred to the authority holding information and why punitive action be not initiated for causing deliberate obstruction to the flow and dissemination of information and violation of the provisions of the RTI Act, 2005, he has asked.This is not the first case where the Commission -- the highest adjudicating authority on the RTI matters -- has pulled up the Home Ministry for ""obstruction"" of flow of information.In a separate case, the ministry had not produced the report of the then CRPF Inspector General Rajnish Rai on alleged fake encounter in Assam which the Commission had sought to be produced for its perusal so as to decide on its disclosure.The then Information Commissioner Yashovardhan Azad had said that in case records are not produced penal proceedings can be initiated against him for obstructing the process of ""adjudication"" of the Commission and causing obstruction to the flow of information.""Under the RTI Act, no records can be withheld from this Commission under any pretext,"" the order had said.It had said the CIC has statutory power which has also been acknowledged by the Supreme Court.""The unusual resistance exhibited by the MHA in producing the records before the Commission cannot be countenanced and the Commission perceives the same to be a direct onslaught on the RTI regime,"" it had said."

I request 1984 Sikh genocide victims not to go to the court tomorrow. He has not got any relief from the Supreme Court. So, he has to surrender.""Speaking to ANI, Phoolka said: ""He simply has to go to the court tomorrow and surrender. If he does not do that, then on January 1 the police will have to take him in custody and send him to Tihar Jail. This is a very big victory for the entire nation, as a mass murderer is going to be punished after years.""Notably, the case against Kumar pertains to the murder of five members of a Sikh family inDelhi Cantonmentarea during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots aftermath of the assassination of then Prime MinisterIndira Gandhion October 31, 1984.The court, which had asked the former MP Kumar to surrender before December 31, made stinging observations over the investigations and said there ""appeared to be ongoing large-scale efforts to suppress cases against him”.""In the summer of 1947, during partition, several people were massacred. 37 years later Delhi was the witness of a similar tragedy. The accused enjoyed political patronage and escaped trial,” the court had said.It added that what happened in the aftermath of the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was ""carnage of unbelievable proportions"" in which over 2,700 Sikhs were murdered in Delhi alone.The victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots hailed the High Court's verdict.Last month, an anti-Sikh riots witness and victim Cham Kaur issued a statement identifying Kumar as the instigator. Another witness named Sheela Kaur also identified him in connection with the case.In March, the Delhi high court had received a petition containing a CD, which was stated to be Kumar's confession about accepting his role in the riots.On December 22 after the decision given by the High Court, the Congress leader filed an appeal in the Apex Court, after the High Court dismissed Kumar's plea seeking more time to surrender. In his plea, he had sought 30 additional days to surrender, on account of settling family affairs with regard to property and inheritance.Earlier on Thursday, the former parliamentarian appeared before Delhi's Patiala House court for hearing in the second case, related to the riots, registered against him by the CBI on the recommendation ofNanavati Commission. The court has adjourned the matter till January 22.As per official records, over 2,700 Sikhs were killed across India after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 by her Sikh bodyguards,Satwant Singh, and Beant Singh."

The DSGMC, in its complaint, has mentioned the FIR registered at Parliament Street police station on the attack on Gurudwara Rakab Ganj, where two Sikhs were burned alive on November 1, 1984.The DSGMC, in its application filed through its general secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said that Gurdwara Rakab Ganj is under the management of the DSGMC, and the complaint is being filed as victim.The complaint reads, “Police arrested five persons on the spot and filed a charge sheet against them, but police with the view to shield the main accused, Kamal Nath, did not even inquire about his role. Kamal Nath, then a senior Congress leader, was present at Gurudwara Rakab Ganj when it was set on fire and two Sikhs were burnt alive. It was the statutory duty of police to inquire, but unfortunately due to his power and influence police did not do so. Police filed a chargesheet against 5 accused who were arrested, but later discharged by the trial court.”It has cited a recent Delhi High Court judgment of November 28, where it held that a person, who is a part of a mob and mob is committing offences ...is liable to be punished for the offence under Section 1489 of the IPC. It has also cited the Delhi HC judgment in Sajjan Kumar case where it criticized the police for trying to help, shield and favour powerful people. “The case FIR No. 60/184 is glaring example of how police has tried to shield the accused.”The DSGMC’s complaint mentions the police never examined journalist Sanjay Suri who had reported about Nath’s presence and later submitted his affidavit to Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission. It has also stated that another eyewitness Mukhtiar Singh also gave his statement to the commission, describing Nath’s role, but despite the strong evidence police failed to properly investigate the case.Pointing out that the SIT has been constituted to reinvestigate the cases which have been closed by the police and never sent for trial, the complaint urges the SIT to investigate the role of Kamal Nath and try him for offences committed by the mob of which he was a part."

The party also appointed Dushyant Gautam and Narottam Mishra as co-in charge.Zadaphia had rebelled against BJP and floated a political outfit, MahaGujaratJanata Party during the 2009 Lok Sabha poll, when Modi was chief minister. He even contested against BJP’s Rajendra Singh Rana, but lost by 6000 votes. Zadapia also launched Sardar Patel Utkarsh Samiti to consolidate the influential Patidars. He, however, returned to the BJP fold, just before 2014 Lok Sabha elections when the saffron party stormed to power and Modi became PM.Zadaphia’s appointment is being viewed by political experts as para-dropping of a hardliner in the UP poll cauldron amid Opposition criticism of BJP for rolling out a communal narrative ahead of Lok Sabha elections. Also, this comes six months after BJP vice-president and Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan Om Mathur developed differences with the UP unit and stayed away from party affairs in UP. He, in fact, skipped the crucial state executive meeting in Meerut to chalk out the party strategy for the general elections.BJP also appointed Dushyant Gautam, member of BJP’s national Scheduled Castes Morcha, as co-in charge. BJP sources see it as a move to consolidate Dalits even as SP and Mayawati-led BSP inch closer to cobbling up an alliance to take on the saffron party. Gautam is a Jatav, a Dalit sub-caste to which Mayawati belongs.Narrottam Mishra too has made co-in charge. Mishra was cabinet minister in the previous Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh, which was wrested by Congress in the recent assembly poll.

I want to ask Rahul if he has any concern for the countrymen dying in terrorist blasts,"" he said.""Why do you (Rahul Gandhi) worry about them? Are they your cousins (mausere bhai)?"" he asked.Exuding confidence about the BJP returning to power after 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Shah said the party's win will mean the victory of nationalism over casteism and nepotism.He claimed that the BJP will return to power in 2019 with a bigger mandate than 2014.Targeting the AAP, he said the party's chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who claims to be a common man, is now moving around with security personnel.""Where are the hospitals, schools, marshals in buses for women's security and CCTV cameras? The condition of Mohalla Clinics is such that filth and dogs have been found in many of them,"" he said.The Kejriwal government has ""failed"" to keep its promises in Delhi, he alleged.Shah claimed that the Modi government had fulfilled all its promises for Delhi and the BJP will give an account of its work to the voters in 2019 elections.He added that it was ""unfortunate"" that the Kejriwal government did not allow implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi fearing Modi will gain popularity.Shah accused the Congress of ""bungling"" crores of rupees by using the National Herald building as ""private property"". He alleged that the party hid Rs 600 crore to save income tax."

He was told to leave the place and a dispute broke out between him and the other suspects.On Wednesday around 11.45am, Gaikwad was on way to home, when the suspects accosted him and sought an explanation from him for visiting the residence of one of the suspects. The group grew angry and in a fit of rage abused Gaikwad and then attacked him.Four men, including three members of Gaikwad’s family, intervened in the fight but were attacked. In the second case, labourer Vinod Gagade (52) from Pawarvasti registered a counter FIR against the suspects over attacking them for intervening in the dispute on Wednesday."

The demand was not part of the original resolution which was placed before the House and distributed among the members. An AAP MLA had inserted it later. In order to get the amendment passed, it must be read separately and get voted upon in the House. So, only the original resolution was passed.“The then PM Rajiv Gandhi justified the riots with his comments that the earth shakes when a big tree falls. It was a disgraceful comment which he used to justify the death of thousands of people. Bharat Ratna should be withdrawn from such a person,” Singh stated outside the assembly which saw a discussion on the riots for two days in the wake of the recent conviction of senior Congress leader Sajjan Kumar.Later AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj tweeted that: “Lines about Late Rajiv Gandhi were not part of resolution placed before the House and distributed to the members. One MLA in his handwriting proposed an addition/amendment about Late Rajiv Gandhi. Amendments cannot be passed in this manner.”“Taking note of the sentiments expressed by the members, this House directs Delhi government to strongly convey in writing to the ministry of home affairs that justice continues to elude the families and near and dear ones of the worst genocide in the history of the national capital,” the resolution, moved by AAP MLA Jarnail Singh, stated.The House also directed the AAP government to convey to the ministry of home affairs that it should take all important and necessary steps to include crime against humanity and genocide in the country’s domestic criminal laws, as recommended by the Delhi High Court in its recent landmark judgement sentencing Sajjan Kumar and other convicts to life imprisonment.“This House further resolves that special fast-track courts be set up for quick and time-bound trials in all pending 1984 riots cases, since 34 long and painful years have already elapsed, during which many victims have passed away and the remaining witnesses are already in advanced stages of their lives. The justice delivery system has, unfortunately, failed the 1984 riots victims so far,” the resolution stated, adding that that “any further delay will only erode the credibility of the investigating agencies and the justice delivery mechanism in the eyes of the common man.”Following a heated argument with some AAP MLAs, Manjinder Singh Sirsa of BJP demanded that one member from each family of the victims should be given a government job and ownership rights on houses within 60 days, saying he would otherwise quit as MLA. Leader of the Opposition Vijender Gupta stated that the 1984 riots were organized violence and the conviction of Kumar has given a sense of relief to people all over the country.Health minister Satyendra Jain observed that justice must be given to the victims of all riots, be it 1984 or 2002. Saying that the perpetrators of the violence were protected, Jain stated that justice must be given within one year a riot taking place.The two-day special session of the Assembly was extended for one day. The next session will be held on January 3.Meanwhile, Delhi Congress chief tweeted that “Sh. Rajiv Gandhi sacrificed his life for the country. True colours of AAP have come out in the open! I have always believed that AAP is the B team of BJP!”"

He was sentenced to death on November 20.In its verdict, the trial court had also awarded life term to co-convict Naresh Sherawat in the case relating to the killing of two men in New Delhi during the1984riots — the first convictions in the cases reopened by the Special Investigation Team (SIT). Delhi Police had closed the case in 1994 for want of evidence, but it was reopened by the SIT formed by the Centre. The SIT is investigating nearly 60 cases related to the riots, while it has filed “untraced report” in 52 cases.While this was the firstdeath penaltyafter the SIT was formed, one Kishori was earlier given death penalty by a trial court in as many as seven anti-Sikh riots cases. However, the HC confirmed death penalty only in three cases, which were later commuted to life term by the apex court.As per the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the death penalty cannot be executed unless confirmed by the high court. The convicts have also been awarded varying jail terms and fines for offences including attempt to murder, dacoity and attacking victims by dangerous weapons.The court spared convict Naresh the gallows while taking note of his medical condition and his lawyer’s arguments seeking leniency in the quantum of sentence.Earlier, the court had convicted Singh and Sherawat for killing Hardev Singh and Avtar Singh in south Delhi’s Mahipalpur on November 1, 1984 during the riots that had taken place after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at her residence by two Sikh bodyguards a day before. The case was lodged on a complaint by victim Hardev’s brother, Santokh Singh. Of the 650 cases registered in connection with the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, 267 were closed as untraced by the Delhi Police. Of these 267 cases, five were later taken up by the CBI."

CBI had reopened the case, apart from three others, on recommendation of theNanavati Commissionin 2005. Kumar’s lawyers said they would appeal against the order.The HC said there was “a familiar pattern of mass killings since the Partition, including Mumbai in 1993, Gujarat in 2002 and Muzaffarnagar in 2013”. The common feature was the “targeting of minorities” with attacks being “spearheaded by the dominant political actors, facilitated by law enforcement agencies”.Delay tested justice system, admits courtIn a strongly worded judgment spanning over 200 pages, the bench said the country saw an “enormous human tragedy” when 2,733 Sikhs were “brutally murdered” in a “communal frenzy” unleashed between November 1-4, 1984.Calling it “an extraordinary case”, the bench observed that in “normal scheme of things” it would have been impossible to proceed against Sajjan Kumar “as there appeared to be ongoing large-scale efforts to suppress cases against him by not even recording them.”It noted that the circumstances “established the apathy of the Delhi Police and their active connivance in the brutal murders being perpetrated”, saying it shows the police “did not inspire the confidence of the victims to come forward and it is understandable that they waited till the CBI took over to speak.”Empathising with the victims the court said, “Their houses were destroyed. In the rest of the country too thousands of Sikhs were killed. A majority of the perpetrators of these horrific mass crimes enjoyed political patronage and were aided by an indifferent law enforcement agency.”HC said though it was “undeniable” that it took over three decades to punish the accused in the case, it was important to assure “those countless victims waiting patiently that despite the challenges, truth will prevail and justice will be done”.Kumar’s conviction came in a case relating to killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar I in Palam Colony on November 1-2, 1984 and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar II. Both areas fell under the jurisdiction of Delhi Cantonment police station.Complainant and eyewitness Jagdish Kaur lost her husband, son and three cousins — Kehar Singh, Gurpreet Singh, Raghuvender Singh, Narender Pal Singh and Kuldeep Singh — to the rampaging mobs who took over the streets a few hours after the assassination of PM Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards.The six accused, including Sajjan Kumar, who was a Member of Parliament at that time, were sent to trial in 2010 but three years later, a special CBI court let off Kumar while convicting the other five, triggering appeals by CBI and the victims. Applauding Kaur and her relatives Jagsher Singh and Nirpreet Kaur, the bench noted that the accused were brought to justice “primarily on account of the courage and perseverance of the three eyewitnesses”.The bench admitted that delays “severely test” the criminal justice system but noted that “it is essential that in a democracy governed by the rule of law to be able to call out those responsible for such mass crimes”.In its decision, HC also took note of the fact that as many as 10 committees and commissions went into the role of some of the perpetrators, but only after the CBI entered the scene in 2005 that the witnesses, represented by senior advocate H S Phoolka, spoke up.“Admirably, they stuck firm to their truth at the trial. This court is of the view that the mass killings of Sikhs in Delhi and elsewhere in November 1984 were in fact ‘crimes against humanity’. They will continue to shock the collective conscience of society for a long time to come,” it observed.The HC also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by the trial court to former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and former MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. All were held guilty on varying degrees for offences of criminal conspiracy to commit murder, promote enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and do acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony. In addition, they were convicted for criminal conspiracy to burn down residences of Sikh families and defile a gurdwara in the area during the riots."

He claimed it was a vindication of his stand as he had been naming Kumar as well as a few other former Congress leaders based on information he received from victims in refugee camps in Delhi during the riots.In a statement, the chief minister stressed that neither the Congress party nor the Gandhi family had any role in the rioting, and alleged that vested political interests were trying to draw their names into the controversy.As the anti-Sikh riots returned to haunt the party after the Delhi High Court on Monday convicted the Delhi Congress leader for conspiracy to commit murder in the case and sentenced him to imprisonment for life, Congress leaders here said that the law would take its own course.""It is a legal, judicial issue.

Bringing such criminals to justice poses a serious challenge to our legal system. As these appeals themselves demonstrate, decades pass by before they can be made answerable.* In India, the riots in early November 1984 in which in Delhi alone 2,733 Sikhs and nearly 3,350 all over the country were brutally murdered was neither the first instance of a mass crime nor, tragically, the last but such cases require a different approach to be adopted.* India has been no stranger to such mass killings since the time of partition in 1947. The mass killings inPunjab, Delhi and elsewhere during partition remains a collective painful memory as is the killings of innocent Sikhs in November 1984. There has been a familiar pattern of mass killings in Mumbai in 1993, in Gujarat in 2002, in Kandhamal, Odisha in 2008, inMuzaffarnagarin UP in 2013 to name a few. Common to these mass crimes were the targeting of minorities and the attacks spearheaded by the dominant political actors being facilitated by the law enforcement agencies.On trial court order acquittingSajjan Kumarearlier* A trial court order of 2013 finding Sajjan Kumar innocent ""suffers from manifest illegality"" as it ""selectively"" found the witnesses reliable in respect of other accused, not him.* The bench said it was ""strange"" that having accepted the witness testimonies regarding the involvement of the other accused, the trial court performed ""a complete U-turn"" when it came to believing their statements as far as the involvement of Kumar was concerned.* The trial court appeared to have ""overlooked"" the larger dimensions of the crimes as it failed to properly address the charge of conspiracy, despite the fact that detailed arguments were submitted by the CBI in that regard.* The bench noted that even the evidence led by the prosecution proved ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that Kumar was the ""leader of the mob"" and ""actively abetted"" the commission of crimes ""by his repeated exhortations to the mob to indulge in the mayhem and kill innocent Sikhs"".On the role of Delhi police* The killing of over 2,700 Sikhs in the national capital during the 1984 riots was a ""carnage of unbelievable proportions"" and the way the Delhi police acted at that time established their ""apathy"" and ""active connivance"" in the brutal murders, the Delhi HC said.* Police had ""indeed turned a blind eye and blatantly abetted the crimes committed by the rioting mob"" and the probe conducted by them in these cases was a farce.* A bench noted it was ""extraordinary"" that despite there being as many as 341 deaths in the Delhi Cantonment area alone over the span of four days beginning November 1, 1984, only 21 FIRs were lodged, of which only 15 pertained to deaths or murders.* Referring to the case on killing of five Sikhs in Delhi, the bench said that the law and order machinery had clearly broken down and it was literally a free for all situation which persisted.(With agency inputs)"

Pathan cited the Supreme Court’s directions for daily hearing in this case.The judge summoned the witness, who told the court that the letter was prepared at the office of an NGO – Citizens for Justice & Peace (CJP) — and he just put in his signature on the letter at the NGO’s office. This revelation by Pathan led the court to issue notice to CJP. An office-bearer, Rafiq Shaikh, appeared before the court on Monday.During the hearing, the court said that the witness and the NGO should not have written the letter and approached the court through proper channel, as they have appointed an advocate for the case.The judge also said that the court is occupied with various other matters also, sources said.Before Pathan dashed off his letter to the court, witnesses’ advocate M A Shaikh wrote twice to the SIT and requested to ensure that the court proceedings take place on day-to-day basis as directed by the apex court. He had pointed out that hearing took place only on 45 days in 2018 as against the SC order for daily hearing.When other witnesses came to know about the development in court on Monday, they condemned it.

The newly sworn-in MP CM Kamal Nath’s role can also be not forgotten, especially when he has been named with evidence in the Rakabganj Gurudwara case during the same 1984 anti-Sikh riots. He should be immediately asked to step down and dismissed from the Congress party,” said Patra.Patra said the Nananvathi commission, which was set up by the former prime ministerAtal Bihari Vajpayee, had named Nath in the Gurudwara incident and that the party had no moral rights to continue talking of “subverting institutions”.“The delay in justice being served to the people in the Sikh riots case is a classic example of the subversion of institutions, including the CBI, which functioned under Rahul Gandhi’s motherSonia Gandhiduring the UP regime in order to protect the Congress party,” he said.On being questioned that Congress senior leaderGhulam Nabi Azadhas already hit back against the BJP by stating that the entire nation knows who has been named and involved in the 2002 Godhra riots inGujarat, Patra said: “Azad is a senior politician but I have to say shame on you. Today, when justice has finally been delivered, the Congress party must stop indulging in Tu Tu Mein Mein (accuse each other), do some introspection and apologise to the nation.”Meanwhile, Patra, who had come to Bengaluru as part of the BJP’s nationwide 70 press conferences to “expose” the alleged lies by the Congress party on the supposed Rafale fighter jets scam, said the Supreme Court has dismantled the lies built by the opposition in the case.“The politically inclined litigations (PIL) have all been dismissed by the SC and have clearly stated that there is no material on record to show commercial favouritism by the Indian government inAnil Ambanibeing chosen as the offset partner for the French manufacturers, with neither pricing or process to select the airplanes being flouted. Perhaps, the Congress cannot come out of their experience of Dalali (middlemen) culture and digest the fact that there are no “mamas” (uncles) in this deal. It is a well known fact that the Congress party has always been encouraged by the Christian Mamas or uncles including Michel Mama in Augusta Westland scam and Quattrochi Mama in the Bofors scam,” he said."

The Chennai city police have denied permission to screen the film on Sunday, said Aravind, director of ‘Thelivuppathayin Neesa Thooram’ (TNT).The film examines the events that led to the serial bomb blasts in 1998, the Coimbatore-based director said. “I met the riot victims, bomb blast victims, doctors who treated them and lawyers. Apart from referring three books on the riots and the blasts, I also collected all news reports from November 1997 to February 1998. I reviewed the FIR, charge sheet and commission reports. It took more than one-and-a-half year to collect the materials,” he told TOI.In November 1997, Coimbatore city had witnessed communal riots that led to the serial bomb blasts, which claimed 58 lives and injured more than 200 people. “It took me three years to complete TNT. It is a crowd-funded independent film. It has been shot in spy camera point-of- view,” the director said.The film was completed recently and was sent to the CBFC in October 2018. “The examining committee refused to certify it. We approached the revising committee, which also refused to screen the film. Both the committees claimed that the film would again trigger riots in Coimbatore,” Aravind said.“The film will reveal the reasons behind the bomb blasts and will touch upon the society generalizing all Muslims as terrorists. Most of the films portray the members of the community as terrorists. CBFC finds no problem with such films. My film reveals the truth behind the blasts. I was planning to screen it in Chennai on Sunday. But the Chennai city police approached me and warned against screening it without CBFC certification. They threatened to take action against me.”The director of Madhubana Kadai, Kamalakannan and veteran actress Rohini portray major roles in TNT. A teaser was released last year.“I will approach the HC on Monday, seeking to screen the film across the state and order the CBFC to issue certification,” Aravind added."

On Monday, inspector Subodh Kumar was killed by a mob as it protested against alleged cow slaughter in the region. An agitator was also killed in the violence after which the mob went on the rampage and indulged in arson and destruction at Chingrawati outpost.WhenTOIvisited the village, most of the women rushed indoors refusing to comment anything on the issue. But one of them, Chetna Devi, confessed that “males had left owing to continuous raids by the police teams in the village.”According to police sources, overnight raids had been conducted in several villages, including Chingravati, Mahav, Chandpur Puthi, Khanpur, Baroli and Naya Baans.Raj Kumar in whose field alleged cow slaughter took place was especially targeted by police, claim villagers. Beena Devi, a former village pradhan and sister-in-law of Raj Kumar, blamed police for the smashed car, chulha, chairs and other items in the household.“A police team comprising 30 men barged into our house at around 1 am and smashed everything in sight when we resisted. Abuses were hurled at us and Raj Kumar’s wife Preeti was beaten up. We are targeted because it was Raj Kumar who had filed police complaint against cow slaughter,” she said. Raj Kumar is absconding as of now. Several other homes have the same complaints.ADG (law and order) Anand Kumar, however, refuted the charges. “We have made six police teams and have also constituted a special investigative team (SIT) to conduct the probe. We have video footages and eyewitnesses’ accounts as primary evidence on the basis of which arrests will be made. Those who are involved in creating the trouble will not be spared and those who are not will not be harassed. There will be no police excesses in this matter and that is why SIT has been formed,” he said."

About three years ago, the private city buses were equipped with speed governors, but motorists claimed that absence of a mechanism to check the rash driving of private buses is leading to many accidents in the city. They sought the authorities to check the speed governors in private city buses to ensure the safety of other road users in the city.Sources said that four years ago the district administration made it mandatory for the private buses to fix speed governors. It is said that the Regional Transport Department has been checking speed governors in private buses every time the buses appear to obtain fitness certificate. But, residents and road users in the city refuse to embrace the tall claims. ""It is clear that private city buses are racing on city roads, particularly near Palpannai. It is a nightmare for two-wheeler riders to drive along private city buses,"" H Ghouse Baig, secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Ponmalai branch, said.As many as 147 private buses are operating in the city, and around 90% of them would have fitted speed governors. However, it seems that traffic police and RTO have failed to check regularly the buses to ascertain the proper functioning of the devices. While speed limit has been revised and fixed at 40 km per hour on city roads during night hours and 30 km per hour during daytime and peak hours, commuters said that private buses should be strictly monitored as they were frequently violating the speed limits.D R Dharmarajan, secretary, Trichy District Bus Operators Association, asserted that a majority of the private city buses have fitted speed governors ever since the district administration made it mandatory. While it is claimed that buses with speed governors cannot steer past 40 km per hour, officials with RTO acknowledged that private buses that have speed governors can even speed up beyond 50 km per hour which would very well violate the speed limit fixed by the district administration last month. ""We ought to examine the functioning of speed governors in city buses. RTO authorities will be urged to take up the issue,"" M Sekaran, member of the Road Safety Council told TOI.Many commuters said that stretches between Palpannai and Kattur, Williams Road, Head Post Office to TVS Tollgate, and Subramaniapuram were among the localities the private city buses exceed speed limit. ""We will step up the inspection to ensure the presence of speed governors in private buses,"" an official with city traffic police wing said.

He blamed the Congress government led by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for ensuring that no case of murder was registered against any person and the FIR was registered for mere arson and rioting only.He said the murderers of 95 Sikhs have not been put on trial yet. He hoped that soon the big sharks too would be in the net of the law and justice would finally prevail. He alleged hordes of Congress workers led by their senior leaders had charged Sikh-dominated Trilokpuri, resulting in brutal murder of 95 innocent people and torching of over 100 houses.Sukhbir said in all, over 3,000 innocent persons were killed in the worst-ever carnage in the history of independent India and people cutting across all religions, countries had condemned this barbaric act.He blamed the tardy investigation for dragging these cases for nearly 34 years after the occurrence of crime. He said, “The real justice would be on the day when the agent provocateurs like Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler would be convicted and send to gallows. And I am confident that day is not too far.”"

The officer, Subodh Kumar Singh, was shot in the head, Jha said.The protesters also set several vehicles on fire and pelted stones at cops, which led the police to open fire, resulting in the death of an agitator, identified as Sumit, 18, of gunshot wounds.File photo of deceased police inspector, Subodh KumarThe area remains tense following the violence that continued for nearly three hours. The state government has deployed additional police, including over 1,000 personnel of anti-riot forces, and ordered multiple probes, including one by a special investigation team led by additional director general of police (intelligence), another by ADG (technical) and a magisterial inquiry.According to sources, trouble started with locals from Mahav village finding carcasses of cows in a nearby forest. Led by members of Hindu outfits, agitators loaded the carcasses on a tractor and placed these near the Chingrawati police outpost on Syana-Garh highway near Bulandshahr city, approximately 150 km from the national capital.“This morning, carcasses of cows were found dumped in a forest area outside the village. Activists of right-wing organisations soon gathered at the spot and alleged that people of a particular community were indulging in cow slaughter,” ADG (law and order) Anand Kumar said.Angry villagers and members of various Hindu groups raised slogans against the police administration and blocked the Bulandshahr-Garh state highway.Expressing grief over the incident, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is away campaigning in Rajasthan, said strict action will be taken against the guilty after the probe reports are received. He also said financial assistance would be extended to victims of the violence.The ADG (law and order) claimed that policemen retaliated with a lathi-charge after the violent mob attacked them.

The mob also targeted police vans and set several motorcycles on fire.In the ensuing violence, Syana SO Subodh Kumar Singh was killed after a bullet hit him near his left eyebrow and remained stuck in his skull.

He did little justice to his experience as a police officer by relying on ‘unverified’ statement of Hyderabad-based businessman Sathish Babu Sana to make ‘shocking’ allegations against Asthana, the CVC, the NSA, a Union minister, the law secretary and a RAW special secretary.The real facts behind these ‘shocking’ allegations need to be found out. We also must know what impelled the IPS officer to level these allegations when theSCthrough ‘sealed cover proceedings’ was scrutinising the CVC report’s which contained “not so complimentary and very uncomplimentary’ remarks against Verma.But the ‘sealed cover proceedings’ appears to have disturbed some, who are questioning its efficacy. The same people have expressed similar doubts over sealed cover proceedings adopted by the SC in scrutinising theRafale deal. Since 2000, ‘sealed cover’ proceedings have been adopted by the SC in Gujarat riot cases, the 2G spectrum allocation scam and the coal block allocation scam.In post-Godhra riots cases, R K Raghavan headed SIT had filed several sealed cover status reports before the SC. As the SC was gunning for the Gujarat government then headed by Narendra Modi, Raghavan was hailed as an independent investigator by social activists and their activist lawyers as media reported the summary of the contents of almost every SIT report.One SIT report unfortunately talked about an activist peddling exaggerated stories about riot victims as also tutoring witnesses. Reporting of this SIT report caused much discomfort. The activists’ lawyer vociferously and repeatedly pleaded with the SC to initiate contempt proceedings against the reporter for revealing details of the ‘sealed cover’ report.In arbitrary allocation of 2G spectrum by UPA government in 2008, the SC had routinely scrutinised ‘sealed cover’ CBI probe status reports. No one questioned the efficacy of such proceedings then.The SC yet again adopted ‘sealed cover’ proceedings to monitor CBI probe into coal block allocations under the UPA regime. The then PM too has been made an accused in the case, though the trial against him has been stayed since 2015 by the SC.Before the ex-PM was made an accused, the CBI made a startling admission on April 30, 2013 — probe status reports, prior to submission to the SC, were vetted by then law minister and two joint secretary level officers, one in the PMO and the other in the coal ministry.On May 8, 2013, the SC recorded, “The draft status report was shared with the law minister, law officers and two joint secretary level officers and at their instance some changes were made. Some of the changes made in these draft status reports are significant.” Changes related to CBI’s PE2, which was on alleged irregularities in coal block allocations during 2006-09, when the ex-PM held the coal portfolio.Those who had subjugated the CBI director, illegally vetted and audaciously made vital changes in the probe status report are now vociferous while shedding crocodile tears for the danger to the CBI’s autonomy. We hope there will be constructive criticism of a decision by the court rather than nitpicking over ‘sealed cover proceedings’.A majority of politicians and activists behave according to the season and circumstances. Very few rise above the surroundings to work for greater common good. It reminds us of a small story: Once a king dreamt of an owl flapping around his throne. None in the durbar could decipher the dream. The king announced a handsome reward of 10 gold coins. A long distance away, a farmer resting under a tree was day-dreaming of the reward. A bird on the tree told the farmer she would share the dream’s meaning if he agreed to share the reward. Farmer agreed. Bird said betrayal and treachery rules the roost in the kingdom. The farmer told the king what the dream meant. The king found it in sync with intelligence reports. The farmer’s happiness fizzled out as soon as he neared home as the thought of giving the bird five gold coins was gnawing him. He took an alternative road home.A year later, the king saw another dream. A knife revolving around his throne. He sent for the farmer, who ran straight to the bird, apologised for betraying her the last time, and promised to share the booty this time. The bird said the dream meant violence would erupt in the kingdom. Satisfied with the meaning of the dream, the king gave 20 gold coins to the farmer. The man was sadder this time and working himself into a fury by repeatedly asking – what will a bird do with 10 gold coins? While heading home, he picked up a stone. As he neared the tree and the moment the bird asked for her share, the man aimed the stone at her. The bird flew away.Next year, the king dreamt of a dove flying around his throne and again sent for the man, who ran to the tree, and profusely apologised for his treacherous and violent actions in the past. In bargain for same promise to share the reward, the bird said this time there is peace in the kingdom and the king could take up welfare works for citizens. A happy king rewarded the farmer with 50 gold coins. The man went straight to the tree, gave all the gold coins to the bird and sought forgiveness.The bird smiled and said gold coins were of no use to her. But few men can rise above the surroundings and prevailing atmosphere to behave like real men, she said and told the farmer to strive to be a real man who remains uninfluenced by the atmosphere of distrust and conspiracy. Prior to every election, politicians across the political landscape behave alike and trade charges against each other with the sole aim of winning votes. We hope times will change."

Death penalty for one, and life term for the other. Behind the scenes of its maiden case related to 1984 Sikh carnage, however, is aspecial investigation team(SIT) and a bunch of lawyers, who put all the scattered pieces of this jigsaw together, piece after piece. The team started from scratch after the SIT was appointed in 2015 hoping to build a watertight case. To do it, the team exercised unconventional ways to gather both evidence and witnesses.The delay of over 30 years had already proved detrimental for the investigation as several witnesses had moved out of India while many others got displaced within the country. For one such witness, who was traced to the US, the team used Skype to recorded his statement. An another witness was found to be living in Italy. He came down from Italy to testify. Both witnesses proved crucial for the case. ""This was unprecedented. But the unique nature of the case required unusual methods of evidence gathering,"" says a source privy to the investigation.The year 1984 in this part of the country saw police's diary entries and other related documents being written inUrduand Gurukumukhi. The team took help of someone from its own department. An old hand, adept inlinguistics, the expert interpreted the texts that were put in compact discs. The case's prosecutor, advocate SK Kain says, ""The investigation was not easy but we tried to put forth the best that we had in evidence and testimonies."" According to him, the prosecution sought death penalty for the nature of crime that was committed. The carnage, he says, had left close to 3,000 dead in Delhi alone. ""It still remains a deep scar in psyche of people. It was essential for the court to take into consideration the heinous nature of crime,"" he adds.Speaking of hurdles, tracing old police records and then decoding them did not come easy. The pages had turned yellow, brittle and blotted with the passage of time. To see the texts clearly, the officials used magnifying glasses. The challenge was to preserve the files and papers for the the pages broke easily even on turning gently. Read, translate and preserve -- was the team's momentary goal.The investigators, on the other hand, comprised 10 inspectors, four ACPs and support staff along with lawyers, who had to scan 650 files with over 10,000 pages and find clinching evidence to build a formidable case.The team took one year alone to trace the old case diaries. When traced, the 30 year old writings had turned illegible. That's when the magnifying glasses came in handy. The team also faced logistical and infrastructural issues initially, but insisted on moving ahead with the investigation.When it came to tracing victim families, a team of officers was sent to Punjab in 2016, while the remaining officials recorded statements of witnesses. ""One witness came all the way from Italy to depose. He is the bother of one of the deceased Avtar Singh,"" says the source.The biggest hurdle came in form of uncooperative witnesses. Convincing them took depose in court required tremendous persuasion. The officers were bent on getting victims on board for the case was largely based on testimony for the absence of medical evidence over the years. ""Also the topography of the place of incident had changed. It was difficult to locate victim families and witnesses. Passing of over 30 years also meant no medical records. The team collected whatever they could find and began a long- arduous journey of investigation,"" the source says.The team traveled toJalandhar's hinterland to trace the first witnesses. Though the team managed to trace the witnesses, it faced their ire. ""Having faced injustice over the years, the victims did not want cooperative and depose in the case,"" the source adds. The team pacified the witnesses and promised them a fair and timely investigation. The unsurprising hostility paved for renewed support.For a watertight case, the team had to work almost 14 hours day, seven days a week. Once through with hundreds of hours in investigation, the team was confident enough to bring it to a logical conclusion. And delivering on its promise, it convinced the court to convict the two accused men essentially on the basis of witness testimonies. The court's appreciation was apparent when it said the investigating was present in court ""on every date""."

This is a legal process, a legal process which must be allowed to work out its course and we are very proud, happy and fortunate that it is taking its course,"" Singhvi had told reporters.Tuesday's court verdict gave some sort of a balm to those suffering for over 30-35 years, Prasad said.The law minister said his party wanted to assure the Sikhs, especially those whose families had suffered, that the SIT would probe the cases honestly, without any undue outside interference, and take action against the guilty.Targeting Nath, who has been accused by some Sikh bodies of having links to the riots, Prasad noted that the Congress had removed him as its in-charge for the Punjab polls last year following protests by people.The Congress should answer as to why was Nath removed, he said.Nath had in the past rejected the charges against him and said he had no links with the 1984 anti-Sikhs riots, following the assassination of the then prime ministerIndira Gandhiby her Sikh bodyguards.Prasad also pointed out that Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded his mother Indira as the prime minister, had said the earth shook when a big tree fell and alleged that the Congress had condoned the organised violence against Sikhs.Former prime ministerManmohan Singhmight have apologised for the riots, but the opposition party should answer if it had disassociated itself from Rajiv Gandhi's comments, the BJP leader said, adding that the remarks had rubbed salt into the wounds of the riot victims.He also asked the Congress to answer why no action was taken against the culprits during its over-two-decades-long rule following the riots.Prasad claimed that the previous Congress governments had set up several committees to probe the riots only to delay justice, adding that in some cases, the opposition party never acted on the reports of those panels.TheAtal Bihari Vajpayeegovernment had constituted the Nanavati Commission, which had said the riots were organised and had also blamed the police, he said.The report of the commission was submitted when the Congress came to power in 2004 and its government took no action, Prasad claimed.He also referred to a commission headed by former chief justice of IndiaRanganath Misra, whose report had largely exonerated the police and claimed that the riots were not a case of organised violence.Noting that the Congress had nominated Misra, now deceased, to the Rajya Sabha in 1998, Prasad alleged that it was a ""reward"" for his report.To a query about other riots, including those inGujaratin 2002, Prasad said there were convictions in many of the Gujarat riots cases and added that a Supreme Court-monitored SIT had questioned Prime Minister Modi, who was the chief minister of the state then, for three days and given him a clean chit."

We now wait for the main conspirators to be punished.”On a momentous day in the history of the riot litigations, many others like Sheela recalled the horrors and the glacial pace of justice. Sundri Kaur, 60, lost her husband Bhagwan Singh as also her brother-in-law and father-in-law in Sultanpuri’s C Block. “My husband was an autorickshaw driver. On November 1, he left home never to return. We don’t even know what fate he met,” Sundri said. “His auto was found at Trilokpuri police station 15 days later.”Sundri remembered with bitterness how she provided information in court about the people leading the rioters and supplying them fuel for arson, but “the opposition lawyers asked me about what I ate that day.” Like her, Banto Kaur claimed that she did not even get the chance to have a case registered against the murder of her father-in-law and brother-in-law.“We escaped from Sultanpuri and hid in Rani Bagh,” Banto said. “I saved my eight-year-old son by making him dress like a girl.” Filled with a new courage after the two convictions, Banto added, “Whether the Sikh victim is from Mahipalpur, Trilokpuri or Sultanpuri, we will fight for them and bring the main conspirators to justice.” Sundri and Banto rued that in trying to fight the cases and make ends meet, they couldn’t give much time to their growing sons.Gurinder Singh, whose father and uncle were killed in Mangolpuri, has spent more than two decades in the courts.Born a month after the riots, he learnt about the manner of his father’s death and has been protesting outside Delhi high court with a plaque demanding justice. “Today, we got some hope. But these are small fish. The big ones need to be brought to book,” he declared.Like Gurinder, Ganga Kaur, who was four at the time of the riots, said that the verdict has filled her with hope. Her family lost 11 members in Trilokpuri.“My father was lynched outside his warehouse while my grandfather was killed inside the gurdwara. We were well-off then, but suffered a lot after that. Justice is long overdue to us,” said Ganga."

Earlier, the court had held the duo held guilty of killing Hardev Singh, who was then 24 years old, and Avtar Singh, 26. Three other men, Sangat Singh, Kuldeep Singh and Surjeet Singh, were injured in the mob attack.“The culpability of both convicts falls within the category of rarest of rare cases,” the judge held, adding that the both men were influential neighbours of the victims. They committed the “horrendous” crime of murder and loot to eliminate the victims without any provocation, merely on the basis of the latter’s faith, community and religion.This was the first conviction secured by the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT), formed in 2015 to reopen Sikh carnage cases. The court also imposed fines of Rs 35 lakh each on the convicts.The 1984 riots had led the Sikh community being “severely prejudiced” with regard to their life and livelihood, and had led to large scale migration, the judge said."

During the riots, not only were my brothers-in-law, 35-year-old Swaroop Singh and 30-year-old Vikramjeet Singh, brutally murdered by mobs, my husband Pratap Singh was also badly injured with sharp-edged weapons. After many days, we found him alive in a hospital. I had to leave Delhi with a seriously-injured husband. He could never even stand after that. Leaving behind a booming business, we started from scrap in Ludhiana and raised my four children, including a daughter who was born after the riots,” said 50-year-old Gurdeep Kaur, who lives in CRPF colony in Dugri which houses around 400 families of the 1984riot survivors.“We could hardly live after the riots and now that judgment has come in two cases, we feel that this should just be the start. We want that big politicians and police officers involved in the riots should be punished. This can be achieved only through fast-track courts so that speedy justice is done to us,” she added.Many victims say that they feel that they have got a small reprieve but are waiting for the day politicians and police officers are punished for the horrific crimes.“The 1984 riots were the worst form of crime against humans. The recent judgments have come as a hope that a day will come when we will see the big fish are punished. This will not end the sufferings of victims, but will at least apply a balm to their wounds,” said Surjeet Singh, president of the 1984 victims’ association in Ludhiana whose family escaped from riots inEtawah.

I don’t know whether it is justice to us or not, but it has taken a long time. We feel that it is just eyewash and is to save big fish by punishing small ones. This is being done to cool down our tempers,” said 38-year-old Lakhwinder Singh, who lives at Tajpur road and owns a furniture shop. “We had to sell our house in Guru Angad Nagar in Old Delhi at throwaway price (around Rs 1.5 lakh for a property of around Rs 6 lakh) after surviving the riots and shifted to Ludhiana.”"

It had awarded life term to Khokhar, Bhagmal and Girdhari Lal and a three-year jail term to two others — former MLA Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar — all of whom have challenged their conviction and sentencing by the trial court in May 2013.Assailing Kumar’s acquittal, the CBI has alleged that the accused persons were engaged in “a planned communal riot” and “religious cleansing”. The case relating to Delhi Cantonment is one of the four cases reopened on the recommendation of Justice Nanavati Commission in 2005. The panel had zeroed in on four of the 241 cases closed by Delhi Police and handed these over to the CBI.Separately, another HC bench had last year reopened five other cases related to theanti-Sikhriots on the ground that a trial court judgment of 1986 acquitting the accused was wrong, since neither the witnesses nor the complainants in these cases were examined properly by the trial court. HC had ordered fresh probe against them noting that they faced allegations of “horrifying crimes against humanity.”Tuesday’s verdict has come due to the prosecution by the Special Investigating Team (SIT) that was set up on February 12, 2015 by the Centre following a recommendation by the home ministry-appointed Justice G P Mathur committee. The three-member SIT comprises two inspector general rank IPS officers and a judicial officer with a mandate to investigate/re-investigate 1984 riots cases “and to take all such measures under the law for a thorough investigation of the criminal cases and to file the chargesheet against the accused in the proper court where after investigation sufficient evidence was found available.”"

They expressed the hope that the other accused will also be brought to justice soon.Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjit Singh GK said the conviction was possible only after the special investigative team formed by the Centre reopened the cases.“For 34 years, we have been fighting against the wall. Eleven commissions and committees were formed during this period, 587 FIRs registered and victims and witnesses threatened. Today’s sentencing has really motivated us and I am sure it will give sleepless nights to Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar,” said GK.He added that the sentencing would inspire a number of witnesses and victims, who had been intimated by the perpetrators, to come out in the open and speak against several others whose role in the attack had not been exposed yet.Former Delhi MLA and BJP national secretary RP Singh said it was a long-awaited decision by the court. “The only concern is that the SC-appointed SIT, which was supposed to submit its report within two months, has not even started working even after eight months of formation, as the name of the third member has not been notified,” Singh said.Senior advocate and the face of the legal struggle of Sikh victims, HS Phoolka, said it was a great judgment and the Sikhleaderswere quite hopeful that in other cases, too, the victims would get justice. “It is a great achievement and will give hope to victims and courage to witnesses to come forward,” Phoolka said.Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi) secretary general Harvinder Singh Sarna echoed Phoolka’s sentiments and said there was hope that other cases would also be heard and the perpetrators sentenced. “People’s trust in the judiciary has increased tremendously with this judgment,” Sarna said.Former Delhi MLA and Congress leader Arvinder Singh Lovely said his party always believed that the guilty should be punished. “It has been the Congress’ firm stance that the victims should get justice fast. In fact, those who play politics on the riots are reason why justice got delayed,” Lovely said.Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa said he would soon move court demanding death sentence to Sehrawat. “He should have also been awarded death sentence,” Sirsa said."

The state government advocate also opposed issuing of a notice in the plea.On February 8, 2012, the SIT had filed a closure report, giving a clean chit to the then chief minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was ""no prosecutable evidence"" against them.Ehsan Jafri was among 68 people who were killed at the Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad when a mob attacked it on February 28, 2002, a day after the S-6 Coach of the Sabarmati Express returning from Ayodhya at Godhra was burned, triggering the riots in Gujarat.""The present Special Leave Petition is filed before this Court against the final judgement and order dated October 5, 2017 passed by the High Court of Gujarat...which erroneously upheld the order of the magistrate accepting the closure report filed by the Special Investigative Agency appointed by this Court concerning the violence in Gujarat in 2002,"" said the plea of Zakia filed through advocate Aparna Bhat.Zakia sought an interim order to the SIT to carry out further investigation with regard to her complaint and the evidence provided by her before the magistrate through the protest petition.The high court in its October 5, 2017, order had said that the SIT probe was monitored by the Supreme Court but had partly allowed Zakia's petition as far as its demand of a further investigation was concerned.It had said that petitioner can approach an appropriate forum including the magistrate's court, a division bench of the high court or the Supreme Court seeking further investigation.Activist Teesta Setalvad, secretary of NGO - Citizen for Justice and Peace- is also a co-petitioner in the appeal seeking reversal of the Gujarat high court order."

The prosecution submitted before the court that the killings were premeditated and part of a genocide against the Sikhs.Asserting that it was a “rarest of rare” case where the victims have been deprived of justice for 34 years, public prosecutor S K Kain and SIT lawyer Surinder Mohit Singh urged additional sessions judge Ajay Pandey to award capital punishment. The defence, on the other hand, asked the court for leniency. The fate of theconvictsnow hangs on the sentencing on November 20.The two men who were killed in communal frenzy on November 1, 1984, were Hardev Singh, who was 24-years-old, and Avtar Singh, who was 26. The court convicted two men for the killings, making it the first conviction secured by the SIT constituted by the Centre in 2015 to probe the 1984 riot cases.Kain submitted that the convicted men—Naresh Sehrawat and Yashpal Singh—had caused the “brutal” murders and wounded three others. “They brought kerosene, sticks, stones, etc. This case falls within the aggravating circumstances as it has been committed after planning that involved extreme cruelty,” the prosecution argued.The prosecution also submitted that the crime exhibited “exceptional depravity”. “Thousands of innocent people were murdered and their properties were looted in Delhi. These incidents affected the society at large. Only the Sikh community was targeted,” the prosecutor said.Defence counsel O P Sharma asked for leniency and argued that the attack was not planned but happened in a flare-up. But the prosecution argued that it was premeditated as it happened a day after then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination on October 31, 1984.Sangat Singh, brother of Hardev Singh, had testified that a Congress leader and Sehrawat were leading the mob, exhorting it to kill Sikhs. He had said that when the mob moved towards them, he and Hardev ran to take refuge in the room of one Surjeet Singh who later became an eyewitness."

TheSIT, comprising an IPS officer, a retired judge and a DANIPS officer, had the almost impossible task of conducting a fresh probe into all cases relating to the riots.Over the passage of 30 years, some complainants and witnesses had moved out from their original colonies, while others had died. Even the policemen who had originally handled the cases had retired or left Delhi. Theriotsites too had undergone changes since.However, the SIT, assisted by a team of around 50 cops, started a systematic effort to join the dots. Led by IPS officer Anurag Kumar, DANIPS officer Kumar Gyanesh and justice Rakesh Kapoor, the SIT was notified as a police station with jurisdiction over entire Delhi. Immediately after its constitution, it issued advertisements requesting riot victims to once again report their cases. The panel members scanned through 650 cases, sorting out 280 which were unresolved.In most of the cases, the witnesses or theaccusedwere no longer alive. Documents related to some medico-legal cases and autopsies were discovered to be missing, but if found damaged, were retrieved with the help of conservation experts. In some cases, victims had kept documentary records secure along with photographic evidence.Enquiring into a case registered atMehraulipolice station, the SIT realised that a politician had been acquitted despite a chargesheet filed against him in 1985. The FIR named Surjeet Singh, Sangat Singh and Kuldeep Singh as witnesses in the case. The cops contacted Sangat Singh, who now lives in Jalandhar, and recorded his statement. He also assisted police in contacting the others.The SIT discovered that though the politician was named in the FIR, it was his associates Naresh Sehrawat and Yashpal Singh who murdered Sangat’s family members during the riots. The two men led a thousand-strong mob in Mahipalpur village and burnt down the grocery shop of Hardev Singh, Sangat’s brother. Hardev, brother Kuldeep and cousin Avtar Singh took shelter with their neighbour Surjeet Singh. The mob detected them there, and SIT said Sehrawat poured kerosene on Surjeet’s belongings and set his house on fire.According to the investigation, the rioters used Surjeet’s kirpan to stab him, Hardev, Avtar, Sangat and Kuldeep. Before ransacking the house, they threw the injured men off the first floor terrace. The five were admitted to Safdarjung Hospital, where Hardev and Avtar died. After recovery, some family members shifted to Punjab, others went overseas. The cops contacted a relative, Ratan Singh, who had identified the bodies, and the Italy resident agreed to depose. He recorded his statement in September last year. Both Sehrawat and Yashpal Singh were chargesheeted based on his statement.The investigative team filed the chargesheet on January 31. During the trial, 18 prosecution witnesses were examined. On October 31 last year, charges for one of the cases registered in Mehrauli were framed after final arguments.The SIT is now probing three cases registered in Janakpuri, Vikaspuri and Saraswati Vihar, all of which name Congress leaderSajjan Kumaras the accused. Kumar has been questioned five times in the past three years. Some of the witnesses now staying in the US are being examined before chargesheets are framed in the cases. Three others cases are pending investigation. The SIT has also transferred a case that was being probed by CBI."

It is definitely a comedy by and for youngsters. In a way, it is also sort of a tribute to the yesteryear comedies of the 80s and 90s that the millinials grew up watching. Sabareesh Varma also pens the lyrics to the song by Rajesh Murugesan. Adding colour to the young and vibrant visuals Gautham Sankar works the camera for Laddoo.Vinu and Angeline, a couple in love, wish to elope and get married. But then, when friends step in to help, it becomes a clear case of 'too many cooks spoil the broth'. With each turn going wrong it seems like there is more at stake than meets the eye.Much like the early 90s movie, Ladoo is the story of a mess that creates itself, thanks to the idiocies of too many, and then struggles to untangle the mess one by one. With debutants cooking this 'Laddoo', the film is a fun ride drenched in comedy. A love story, and a planned eloping and a chase- the story is as old as time, but what makes it different is the young and fresh narrative style. Everything from the songs stand out as stylish.

The captain of an Afghan airliner, headed to Kandahar, sent a hijack alert toair traffic control, which activated an emergency response.The Airbus A-310 with 124 passengers (including an infant) and nine crew members was asked to immediately stop from proceeding for take-off to Kandahar and instead told to taxi to an isolation bay at the airport. Once docked, it was surrounded by CISF and other security personnel.This is when the pilot told the security team that he had sent the message by mistake. Not willing to take any chances, CISF sanitised the aircraft and frisked all on board. TheAriana Afghan Airlinescommander, it emerged, was briefing his co-pilot about the protocol in the event of a hijack. CISF and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security said the captain pressed the hijack button by mistake.1999 lesson learnt well, says senior pilotThe flight’s captain, Rokai Naimi, submitted a written note saying: “Today our staff in Delhi informed us that there are plans of hijacking aircraft. In cockpit, I briefed my first officer… Regarding this code we should be careful… But it was too late, the Delhi ATC got it… It happened while briefing. It is not true (sic).”Once cleared by security, flight FG-312 took off from Delhi at 5.41pm, a little more than two hours behind schedule. BCAS chief Kumar Rajesh Chandra said: “The captain said his airline staff in Delhi had informed him about plans to hijack the plane. He committed the mistake of inadvertently pressing the hijack button.”A senior pilot, who had watched the Indian Airlines' Kandahar hijack in December 1999 from close quarters, said: “While what happened on Saturday was a mistake, it was good see that the plane was not allowed to take off and asked to taxi to a parking bay.”"

The witness’s examination in chief was conducted at the previous round of hearing in Pune on October 5.Senior lawyer B G Bansode conducted the cross-examination on behalf of Thane residentTukaramGaware, whose vehicle was torched during the clashes at Koregaon Bhima. He focused on establishing a link between Dabhade and his friends, and Ekbote, Bhide Guruji and Hindu Rashtra Sena chief Dhananjay Desai, among others.Bansode furnished a slew of photographs (featuring pictures of Dabhade and his friends with these leaders); messages circulated on a WhatsApp group involving Dabhade as a member; and pamphlets and slogans published and distributed ahead of January 1, calling upon a particular class (Hindus) to gather against the Dalits. Bansode suggested that because of these messages, the persons, including Dabhade, responded to the call and participated in the riots. Dabhade maintained, “It is not correct.”Dabhade initially insisted that the photographs furnished by Bansode were “morphed”, but later conceded that the same carried his pictures although he had no knowledge about who published and distributed the same. Bansode also crossed the witness on the December 29, 2017 events at Vadhu Budruk to suggest that a bigger mob of nearly 1,000 people had gathered there as a part of a pre-planned activity against the Dalit community. Dabhade denied it, saying, “I do not know.”Dabhade was among the eight people arrested on December 29, 2017 in relation to a case registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act following the Vadhu Budruk incident. He was released from jail on January 7, 2018.He told the commission that he had no knowledge about the history behind the January 1 incident and that, he was not in a position to say whether or not to support the slogan “Ek Hindu, Lakh Hindu” calling for Hindus to unite at Vadhu Budruk to counter the attempt to spread distorted history aboutChhatrapatiSambhaji Maharaj.Dabhade replied in the negative to the suggestions that he was known as “Hindushree Sharad Dabhade” and “Sarkar” in his village and said he had heard about Sambhaji Bhide and Shree Shivpratishthan Hindusthan. On the events of December 29, 2017, Dabhade mostly said “I do not know” and “it is not correct” to the question phrased by Bansode, suggesting destruction of Govind Gopal’s samadhi as a part of a pre-planned conspiracy."

He held a copy of the court order convicting his elder brother, Naresh Sehrawat, of killing two men and injuring three others during the1984anti-Sikh riots.In the presence of the younger members of his family, Suresh refused to say much except that his brother was innocent and had been framed in the case. “We don’t want to talk about it. Such talking had led to my brother getting framed and arrested for no reason,” said Suresh. “He is now an ailing, aged man, but has been taken to jail.” He then went back into his hotel to pore through the court order once again.The family managed to keep the news about Naresh’s conviction to themselves, and the local residents appeared not to be aware, or feigned ignorance. One of them, requesting anonymity, said, “The family is well off and runs a chain of hotels and has properties on the highway. Naresh used to work at the local post office but earned enough to invest profitably after some of his property was acquired for the IGI Airport revamp project.”The Sehrawats’ neighbour, Yashpal Singh, was alsoconvictedin the same case. Singh’s family too refused to comment on the day’s developments. Singh had sold some property around two decades ago and used the money to construct two hotels on the Mahipalpur main road facing the national highway.A friend of Naresh’s father, Devi Ram, confided that both the convicted men were associated with a political leader at the time of the riots. “I don’t know if they participated in the riots, but both were supporting the ruling party then,” Ram claimed. “Congress leaders used to visit their home for family functions.” He added, “Naresh is a good man, but may have supported the rioters for financial gains.”"

The trainees were so furious that even SSP Manu Maharaaj could not enter the premises for over 40 minutes around 12.The trainees alleged that Savita had been suffering from high fever for the last three days but despite that the DSP did not grant her leave. On top of it, he forced her to perform traffic duty near Kargil Chowk.Savita was taken to a private hospital on Wednesday morning but she died there within a few hours. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has sought a report from DGP KS Dwivedi on the unprecedented incident within three days.The DGP, who was in Delhi, told a TV channel that the young recruits were yet to be trained and they might have been provoked by someone to protest over their colleague’s death in an indisciplined and violent manner. The DGP has asked DIG (central range) Rajesh Kumar to probe the violence.As soon as the violence began, the situation turned serious. The bodyguards of senior police officers fired at least four rounds in the air to keep the trainees at bay. All this while, the trainees kept on smashing police vehicles parked on the premises. They also ransacked the office and residence of the sergeant major. Later, they came out of the complex and indulged in acts of vandalism, damaging vehicles and shops in the area.When they damaged a CCTV camera installed at a nearby temple and tried to take away its hard drive to destroy the evidence, the locals started throwing stones and bricks at them. The trainees then retreated to the Police Lines and hurled stones and bricks at the locals in retaliation. At least 10 people were injured in the attack. Some media persons were also hurt.Mashluddin’s mother Haruna Khatoon, wife Anjum Ara and 20-year-old daughter Amrin Ajeen were also manhandled. His wife told TOI that the trainees barged into their residence while chasing the DSP. “We stood at the door leading to the room where he was hiding. I told them they would have to kill all of us before entering the room,” Anjum said. “Mashluddin is in hospital and his condition is serious,” she added."

The resolution was submitted by Alex Charlton and Jamie Santora as 'noncontroversial resolution' under Rule 35, he said.It said the Sikh community, which originated in Punjab (India), began immigrating into the United States over 100 years ago and had played an important role in developing the country and the Commonwealth. The resolution stated that the Sikh genocide began on November 1, 1984, after the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in Delhi and the states of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa, Jammu and Kashmir, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra.On April 16, 2015, the California state assembly had unanimously passed 'assembly concurrent resolution' 34 which recognized the alleged 'systematic and organized' killings of Sikhs in Delhi and remembers those who lost their lives during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.The resolution also talked about the mass grave discovered in 2011 at Hondh Chillar village in Haryana and 'widow colony' of Tilak Vihar in Delhi.It says that the Sikh genocide lasted three days and over 30,000 Sikhs were brutally murdered or died as they were hunted in their homes, where they were hacked and burned alive.Pritpal, who is also a member of American Sikh Caucus Committee, said that they (Sikh leaders) hailed Charlton and Santora for presenting and general assembly of Pennsylvania for passing the resolution."

The book, which will be formally launched by former Vice President Hamid Ansari at theIndia International Centrein New Delhi, is scheduled to hit the stands on Saturday.In an interview with a news agency recently, the former VC had said, “The crucial period was the intervening night of February 28 and March 1, 2002. I had met the then chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, at 2 am. My troop sat on the airfield an entire day on March 1. We got vehicles only on March 2. By then the damage had occurred. Some crucial hours were lost.”Hundreds had died in the riots that shook Gujarat that year.Mohammed claimed that Shah had met PM Modi on March 5, 2016 and complimented the latter for “controlling riots in a swift manner”. “I had accompanied Shah to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s residence. During their interaction, Shah complimented Modi for controlling the riots in a swift manner. He had also thanked the PM for taking steps to quell the riots. He never mentioned about the delay in getting vehicles,” said Mohammed.When contacted, Shah, a recipient of the Param Vishish Seva Medal,Vishisht Seva Medaland Sena Medal for his services in the armed forces, said, “I never criticised the PM during my interviews. I have always stressed that the delay in providing logistics was an administrative failure. The riots were controlled within 48-hour by the Army. I have not twisted any facts. I stand by what I have stated.”Shah admitted that Mohammed had accompanied him to the PM’s house. TOI also has a copy of the letter that Admiral L Ramdas had sent Shah on October 10, 2018, which states: “At the time of the riots, Shah had informed me about how his troop had to wait one whole day before being provided with transport facilities by the authorities. Had the troop been allowed to restore law and order on the first day of the riots, many more lives would have been saved.”"

He wants every Muslim family that was forced to leave his village Dulheda in UP’sMuzaffarnagar districtto now return home. Of the 65-odd Muslim families in Dulheda — situated in the Shahpur region of Muzaffarnagar — that fled after the deadly riots that shook the area in August and September 2013, Pradhan has persuaded around 30 to return.Pradhan’s efforts resonate more in the restive region because the 42-year-old had helped save several Muslim families during the riots by not only giving them shelter in his home but also ferociously guarding them at the places where they had taken refuge.Afsana Begum, who came back to the village after more than four years, recalls, “I remember how he and his men guarded our mosque. He wouldn’t let anyone touch it. He protected us with his life. If he says we should come back, I will trust him without thinking twice.” On his part, Pradhan says he judges people on the basis of their character, not religion.“Mussalman kharab hai? YaHindukharab hai? Insaan kharab hai (Is the Muslim bad, or is the Hindu bad? I will say it is the person who is bad). We need to fight and hope for change. I am only doing that,” he says.Sticking to his conviction has not been easy though. Pradhan, a former village head, had to incur criticism of the members of his Jat community (who make up most of the population of the village) for “being an obstacle when an opportunity had come for ridding the village of Muslim influence forever.”Nawab Singh, one of his supporters, says, “Sanjeev Pradhan lost the village head elections in 2015 and one of the primary reasons was his act of saving minority members’ lives in the riots. Some of the Hindus had even started greeting him with Salam-Alaikum in a sarcastic manner, claiming he was now almost a Muslim.”Looking back, Pradhan says he wouldn’t have done a thing differently. “I vividly remember the day — September 8, 2013. We could hear gunshots in the distance and, later, it became quite evident that the carnage had begun. Since most of the minority families and the lone mosque was near my house on the southern end of the village, we had started guarding their homes ever since the first murders were reported on August 27 in Kawal village, which triggered the riots.”Located just a kilometre away from Kutba, the village that witnessed the killing of eight Muslims, Dulheda, too, could not remain untouched by the violence that erupted, which eventually led to 62 deaths and the displacement of over 50,000 people from Muzaffarnagar district. However, Pradhan and his supporters unflinchingly resisted all attempts by people from neighbouring villages to stoke communal fires in their village.Bala Bano, a resident who returned to the village at Pradhan’s insistence, recalls those terrifying days. “We were full of fear and uncertainty. If Pradhan hadn’t been there, we would not have survived. When the situation started to deteriorate in the first week of September (2013), he called up our menfolk who were out of the village to immediately return and took us to the safety of his house, which was being guarded by his men. Even at night, he used to sit outside and keep vigil himself. We owe our lives to him.”Afsana remembers how Pradhan arranged for more than 300 Muslims to be escorted to the Palhera and Shahpur relief camps. “He wanted to come with us himself to the relief camps but we told him that could jeopardise his own safety. He, therefore, organised buggies to transport us to the camps. I remember we were extremely scared but his supporters, all Jats wielding arms, walked by our side throughout the way and ensured that nobody was harmed.”After the Muslim families had moved to the shelters, Pradhan made sure that their cattle were taken care of and their houses protected. Sajid Ahmad, one of those who returned after staying in a relief camp for some time, says, “Muslim families in the village do not have big landholdings and mostly depend on cattle rearing. So, it was a big relief when we came back to find that our cattle were safe.”Pradhan says that the village society works on mutual trust and can function optimally only when people co-operate with each other. “Muslims in the village are a big help to farmers like us. They help us during the cane harvest, build our houses and co-operate in so many other things. We are all dependent on each other and need to respect each other. I will keep trying to get them back home.”"

It is a farcical comedy that was written in 1990 and has been adapted in multiple languages across the world. Staged at LTG Auditorium, this adaptation by Nikunj Wadhawan is set in Suite 648 of a plush hotel in Delhi. A cabinet minister’s secretary Girija Shankar Das (Shom Gupta) books a suite to have an illicit affair with young and attractive Kamiya Chowdhary (Vijaya Rathore), the opposition’s secretary. However, not everything goes as planned and their romance soon turns into a misadventure with the discovery of a supposedly “dead body” stuck in the sash window of their suite.Fearing the headlines next day and the repercussions this awkward situation could have on his personal and professional life, Das does what any aspiring, philandering politician would do – not report anything to the hotel management or to the police. He instead calls up his junior assistant Purshottam Bagga (Nikunj Wadhawan) to help him dispose of the “corpse”.Cover-ups seldom go as planned, so hiding the “corpse” into a cupboard creates a lot of rib-tickling moments and a funny exchange of dialogues between Das and Bagga. As the plot progresses, the quick-witted Das churns out a pack of ingenious lies to save his devious skin. While the characters are truthful and believable, the situations they are caught up in are not-so-ordinary, exaggerated and implausible.COMIC TIMING: Nikunj WadhawanThe tangled web of lies that keeps building up between Das and Bagga and the rest of the cast leads to a lot ofROFLmoments. Both the actors have a good comic timing and effortlessly mouth several of their dialogues inBengaliandPunjabi, respectively. Ankur Saxena as an over-friendly and gossipy waiter and Dhruv Bhatia as the over-polite manager are quite relatable, too. Apart from the cast playing its roles quite convincing, there are moments when the unreliable window of the suite becomes the hero of the scene leading to a state of confusion and mayhem.With its door-slamming, trouser-dropping moments (of the jealous and obnoxious husband of the cheating secretary played by Sumit Bhott), the 85 minutes long play makes us laugh uncontrollably. Highly-exaggerated, improbable situations and a generous dose of elements like physical humour and deliberate absurdity make it an entertaining watch.Dhruv Bhatia and Sumit Bhott"

Recalling the fight for ‘Punjabi Suba’, he said Congress had committed more than the Mughals and the British. “Youngsters do not even know or remember what Congress has done to them. Sikhs and their revered shrine, Darbar Sahib, were attacked in their own country by their own prime minister. I had visited the Golden Temple just two days after it was besieged in the Army’s attack and saw blood in its reservoir (sarowar). After this, Indira’s son Rajiv Gandhi took reigns as prime minister and innocent Sikhs were killed and burnt alive. But we are used to forgetting... We want peace and harmony, which have come back to Punjab after a long time and should not be disturbed,” he said.Badal recalled provocative statements that political leaders use to make during the days of militancy to disturb peace. “They would say ‘pehlan waddan ge monnay, pher waddan ge jhone (first, we will cut people with shorn hair and then paddy),” he said. “We don’t want this again.”He urged Sukhbir to hold the next rally in Doaba and then the third inMajha.Sukhbir called people behind desecration cases which took place during the SAD’s rule as ‘rakshas’ (demons). Speaking on the sacrilege case of Bargari, Faridkot, he said the crime was committed to disturb peace in Punjab. “If anyone was mortified at this development, it was SAD. The Congress used it as a defamation campaign against us and is still teaming up with elements who are using the name of the Panth to earn money,” he said.He said AAP leader Sukhpal Khaira did not have any respect for Guru Granth Sahib and had gone to Bargari only out of monetary interests.On Punjab CM Amarinder Singh’s visit to Lambi on Sunday, Sukhbir said, “Capt Amarinder found time to come to Lambi one and a half years after being rejected by people. He did not visit Darbar Sahib after winning the Lok Sabha election from there. He also does not care for many segments of Patiala, even though he was elected from the city in 2017. The Congress has closed down sewa kendras, stopped scholarships for SC students and even stopped CM Teerath Yatra Scheme,” he said.SAD leaders also took on the Congress government for refusing to reduce fuel prices. Meanwhile, BJP state president Shwait Malik asked the Congress to disclose what had happened to the 32 lakh jobs promised to the people.List of Taksali leadersAfter the rally, former CM Parkash Singh Badal asked SGPC former president Kirpal Singh Badungar to write down the names of Taksali Akalis or jathedars (political prisoners), including those who had faced imprisonment along with him. He said the names along with their sacrifices should be prepared so that they all could be honoured. The move comes at a time when there have been reports of party’s senior leaders not being happy with the leadership.The slogan ‘Sukhbir Badal zindabad’ was raised during most of the rally. Badal, in his speech, took only two names, of son Sukhbir and BJP state president Shwait Malik. He also thanked SGPC leaders, senior leaders of SAD, and party workers for attending the rally.Malik calls Badal a ‘sanyasi’In the beginning of his speech, BJP state president Shwait Malik called former CM Parkash Singh Badal a ‘darvesh’ (sufi saint) politician, but then took a break and said he was a ‘sanyasi’ (religious mendicant). Malik claimed that there were only two politicians in India who cared for farmers — PM Narendra Modi and Parkash Singh Badal.‘SAD not owned by Bada family’SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was not a property of his family but it was the party of elders. He added that there was every chance that presidents of the party would change in the coming years."

When cycling bards sparked a laugh riot in Bengaluru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/theatre/when-cycling-bards-sparked-a-laugh-riot-in-bengaluru/articleshow/66053699.cms,"William Shakespeare,The HandleBards,Romeo and Juliet,Ranga Shankara",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.comNone,"The air is infectious as the audience and the cast members play catch and catch with a beach ball. What’s the occasion? The super quirky theatre troupe from the UK,The HandleBards, are performing their uniquely hilarious adaptation of Shakespeare’s timeless theatrical masterpiece,Romeo and Juliet. After a performance where actors Lucy Green, Charlotte Driessler, Eleanor Chaganis and Sian Eleanor Green, along with director Nel Crouch, put on funny attires, over-the-top props and draw huge bouts of laughter from the audience, members from the team spoke toBTabout the experience of expecting the unexpected, throwing a comical spin on a classic and more.Dealing with chaosTalking about the dynamic nature of the play, Nel says, “I don’t travel with the girls every time they perform. But each time I do manage to catch the show on stage, I realise something new has been added.” In an unexpected turn of events, ahead of one of their shows in Bengaluru, Eleanor lost her voice and Nel stepped up to share the role. Yet, there was no cutting back on quality. If anything, the play got more funny. “Well, the show must go on,” laughs Nel.Choosing to perform ShakespeareShakespeare’s mastery over the English language is a big draw for the team to take up the plays. “Our founders are passionate about his works. And there are no rights to be bought for the plays,” says Lucy. The troupe believes that people often get intimidated with the bard’s linguistic prowess. Nel explains, “This is one of the reasons we perform outdoors. We want to make it casual and make Shakespeare accessible.”Making theatre accessibleFor their European performances, the team travels on their bicycles, carrying all the set, props and costumes needed to perform. “We want to take art and culture beyond performances in major cities to the inner locales,” says Lucy. When on tour, away from Europe, the team perform in schools, so that the bard’s works pass on to the next generation. Have they travelled in India by bicycle? “We are kind of overwhelmed by the traffic,” they laugh nervously.Roles not bound by gender“The company started as an all-boys gang. However, we felt the need for a female group, and it is interesting to experiment with this, because when it comes to the bard, the male roles are often meatier,” says Nel. This kind of a comedic spin on a classic, the girls believe, is super-fun to play around with, as it completely changes the gender game. “When gender is not a priority, whoever is right for the role, gets the part. On one occasion, we even had one of the men go up and perform the role of Juliet,” says Lucy. Such a practice results in creating an environment enabling empowerment. “When the boys used to perform, people would tell them that women cannot be as funny as men. Well, here we are!” the girls sign off.The team are all set to perform Romeo and Juliet on October 4 and October 5 atRanga Shankara, 7.30 pm."

He said the BJP and Hindu outfits did not expose the police role in the riots all along.Addressing among the Hindu Munnani workers at Theppakulam ground here on Monday, Radhakrishnan said traffic police constable Selvaraj had stopped three people who were travelling in a two -wheeler and did not allow the triple ride. So, he was brutally murdered in the day light in November 1997. “All that followed were not done by BJP or Hindu Munnani. It was all done by police personnel who could not bear the murder of Selvaraj. But we did not expose the involvement of the police at any situation. But Hindutva people who were not involving in any riots, were spending their days behind the bars. Exposing the police is equal to betraying the nation,” said Radhakrishnan.Later, he met reporters and said that Ganesha Chathurthi festival has been indicating that Tamil Nadu state returning to its spiritual feelings. Some people were telling that Tamil Nadu is the land of Periyar and atheists. But this is a spiritual land. “Unidentified people desecrated the statue of Periyar at Dharapuram in Tirupur district. BJP is not having any faith on such dishonorable activities. The greatness of the saffron is that it opposes ideas with ideas. We won’t take the violence in our hands. At the same time, we won’t bend to violence,” said Radhakrishnan."

The agitation led to removal of Singh from the post of director. However, even after the protest ended, students continued to post memes in the group due to the overwhelming response. “Latest posts are all about ongoing issues on the campus,” said another student.Raising the issue of ragging on the campus, students posted a meme showing a picture of students with captions “Batch of 2022” and “the floor is UGC complaints”. Students said the meme was about the trend of ragging complaints.Taking pot shots at the university’s name, a meme showing a student scratching his head, reads, “My College is called National Law University, but it is established by a state legislation.”"

The complainant had then challenged the order in HC which also dismissed his plea.The FIR said that on January 27, 2007, on the occassion of Satvi Moharram, Adityanath had given a call, following which members of right-wing outfitHinduVahini and others raised slogans. The agitators allegedly indulged in destructive activities after which police fired several rounds in the air.The FIR was lodged on charges of rioting, outraging religious feelings, trespassing on burial places and promoting enmity between groups."

Local residents had donated land for the institute and AMU had provided a grant of Rs 50 lakh. However, five years down the line, out of 325 students in Sir Syed National School in Muzaffarnagar’s Jola village, only 20 children of riots-hit people study here. According to some riots victims, the promise of free education was a farce as it costs nearly Rs 15,000 annually to send a child to the school.“We were promised that our children will be given free education. Later, however, we were told that we need to pay tuition fees, buy books and uniform and pay for other expenses. It felt like a rude joke. We are living in a resettlementcolonyand cannot afford to spend that much on our children’s education,” said Rashid Ahmed, who lives in Ekta colony, which is barely 300metres from the school. Rashid has four children and all of them are enrolled in a nearby government school.Rashid’s neighbour Abid Ahmad said, “I have four children. I want to give them quality education but cannot afford to send them to private schools. We had high hopes from this institute. We were promised free education, but were later made to realize that nothing is for free.”The school management, however, had a different story to tell. Mohd Anas, a member of the management committee, said, “We just charge a monthly tuition fess of Rs 550. We also provide free evening tuitions to children of riots victims for three to four hours daily. Students from all backgrounds are enrolled here. Our school is affiliated to CBSE and we provide quality education to all.”Meanwhile, Jola village pradhanJamshed Ahmedsaid, “Frankly, majority of people who were displaced in 2013 cannot afford to send their children to Sir Syed National School. While the institute’s tuition fee is not too high, there are other expenses involved. My children go to Sir Syed National School and I know that it costs nearly Rs 15,000 annually to send one child to the school.”"

After Akali MLABikram Singh Majithialed the attack on the Congress, chief ministerAmarinder Singhreiterated that the party was not connected with the violence and any involvement of a few Congress leaders could have been only at an individual level. The issue had come back to the fore after Congress national chief Rahul Gandhi said in the UK that the Congress was not involved in the anti-Sikh riots.Even as Akali leaders indulged in sloganeering and staged a walkout, Amarinder said that the Majithia must have been in a pram when the riots took place and had no knowledge about the issue at all.The former minister raised the issue of Rahul Gandhi's recent statement on the 1984 riots in the House, to which Amarinder responded with a strong missive to the Akali leader not to indulge in falsehoods.Amarinder told mediapersons later that Majithia was just about eight years old at the time of the riots and was probably in a pram. What does he know about the issue, asked Amarinder, warning the Akalis against playing with the sentiments of the Sikhs on the sensitive matter.Earlier, reiterating his stand on the issue in the House, Amarinder said he had personally visited relief camps immediately after the incident and met people there.People in the camps had named some individual Congress leaders, like H K LBhagat,Sajjan Kumar, Arjan Das and Dharamdas Shastri, which he had subsequently revealed to the public, said Amarinder.""I have been naming these people for the past almost 34 years,"" said the CM, adding that he had named the people who were mentioned to him, and not out of any personal knowledge."

They were arrested in 2015-16 by various agencies and put on a trial.After conducting the trial against these five persons in Sabarmati Central Jail, Godhra’s additional sessions judge, H C Vora, sentenced Imran alias Sheru Bhatuk (37) and Faruk Bana (57) to life imprisonment for their role in the carnage.Three persons – Hussain Suleman Mohan, Kasam Bhamedi and Faruk Dhantiya were exonerated for want of evidence.Another accused person, Kadir Patiliya, had been arrested in this case but he died due to cardiac arrest in Sabarmati Central Jail in January.According to special prosecutor N NPrajapati, Bhana was an elected member of the Godhra municipality in 2002. He has been convicted for leading a violent mob, for instigation and assault on passengers.Bhatuk had a role in the conspiracy as well. He was present at the meeting at Aman Guest House and when the train arrived, Bhana took a carboy full of flammable liquid from Razzak Kurkur’s house, put it on a vehicle and brought it to the S-6 coach.He was among three persons who got into the bogie and poured the liquid fuel inside after Shaukat Lalo opened the door from the inside of the coach.The prosecution demanded the death sentence for the duo, claiming this was the “rarest of the rare” case and the SIT court in 2011 handed down the death penalty to 11 convicts in this case.The state government has filed an appeal before the Supreme Court against Gujarat high court’s decision to reduce the capital punishment to life imprisonment.The killing of 59 karsevaks in the train near Godhra railway station sparked communal riots across the state, which led to the loss of more than 1,000 lives over the next three months."

It was a tragedy, it was a painful experience. You say that the Congress party was involved in that, I don't agree with that. Certainly, there was violence, certainly there was tragedy,” he said.Union cabinet minister of food processing industry Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a series of tweets on Saturday, held the Congress and the Gandhi family responsible for the “carnage”. She asked Rahul to explain why Sikhs had been denied justice for 34 years. In another tweet, she said his family name was synonymous with the massacre of Sikhs, desecration of the Golden Temple, demolition ofAkal TakhtSahib and sacrilege of thousands of Guru Granth Sahibs.Describing the Congress as perpetrators of the anti-Sikh riots, AAP MLA H S Phoolka said every mob killing Sikhs during the riots was led by a Congress leader. “The party later rewarded leaders who were involved in the killings,” said Phoolka, a noted lawyer who has represented riot victims in Supreme Court.SAD president Sukhbir Badal asked Rahul to explain what kind of hold perpetrators of the riots had over him and reminded him that former Prime MinisterManmohan Singhhad apologised for the violence in the Lok Sabha. “You should tell the nation why these apologies were offered if the Congress was not involved in the mass lynchings,” he added. The former deputy CM also reminded Rahul about an interview he had given on March 16, 2014, in which he had stated that he shared the sentiments of both Dr Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi on the issue. “Why this about turn now? Are you sending across a message of assurance to 1984 lynching perpetrators Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar,” he asked.Sukhbir said Tytler had already admitted to his role by stating that he drove Rajiv Gandhi in an Ambassador car on November 1, 1984, to places like Azadpur Mandi and Mukherjee Nagar when killings of Sikhs and looting and burning of their properties were in full swing. “This amounts to admitting that Rajiv supervised the massacre of Sikhs, a fact corroborated by the Nanavati Commission, which stated that maximum Sikhs were butchered in areas which Rajiv Gandhi visited on Nov 1, 1984 (sic),” he said."

For him, Sikhs are merely vote bank, BJP national secretaryRP Singhsaid.Addressing the Indian diaspora at a function organised by theIndian OverseasCongress in Berlin last night, Gandhi said the Congress's thought of ""unity in diversity"" came from the times of Guru Nanak Dev, and the BJP-RSS divides people and spreads hatred.In a sharp reaction to his remarks, Singh said Gandhi's thoughts are actually in line with the Congress culture of divide and rule.""We are pained to know that Gandhi, who reminds us of anti-Slkh riots of 1984, claims that his thoughts resemble to the first Sikh guru -- Guru Nanak Devji. Actually his thoughts are in line with Congress culture of divide and rule,"" Singh said.Congress leaders justified the 1984 killings of innocent Sikhs and they treated Sikhs like demons, he claimed, while demanding ""Rahul should apologise for the heinous crime in front ofAkal Takhtat Golden Temple in Amritsar"".Akal Takht is the highest body of Sikhs and Golden Temple is the most prominent shrine of the religion.Taking on Gandhi over the same issue, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said the Congress president has demeaned the Indian culture and he is an immature politician. Leave aside leading the country, Gandhi is even incapable of heading a political party, he further said."

There are legal processes ongoing in India but as far as I'm concerned anything done that was wrong during that period should be punished and I would support that 100 per cent,"" he said.""I have no confusion in my mind about that. It was a tragedy, it was a painful experience. You say that the Congress party was involved in that, I don't agree with that.

I get disturbed when I see anybody being hurt. So, I condemn that 100 per cent and I am 100 per cent for punishment for those involved in any violence against anybody. That's crystal clear,"" said Gandhi.He said that people, who have not had violence inflicted upon them, think that violence is what one sees in movies.""That's not what it is. I have seen people who I loved very much being killed. I have also seen the person (Prabhakaran) who killed my father being killed.""When I saw Prabhakaran lying on the beaches in Jaffna (Lanka), when I saw him being humiliated, the way he was, I felt sorry for him, because I saw my father in his place and his children in my place,"" he added.""So, when you are being hit by violence, when you understand it, it has a completely different impact on you.""Gandhi said most people do not understand violence which is a horrible thing.Some Congress leaders have been accused of leading the killer mobs during the riots. They have denied the allegations.Earlier Gandhi had invoked Guru Nanak Dev, the first Sikh guru, during his address in Germany, drawing sharp reaction from the BJP which said Gandhi should apologise for the ""heinous crime"" at the Golden Temple."

It was alleged that several incidents of violence were reported in Gorakhpur on that day after an allegedhate speechby Adityanath.The FIR had also claimed that Adityanath's alleged hate speech had led to the riots, in which ten people were reported killed. Adityanath was arrested and sent to police custody for 11 days.On February 1, theAllahabad High Courthad upheld the quashing of a magistrate's order that had taken cognisance of a charge sheet against Adityanath in connection with the riot case.The high court had dismissed the petition against the Sessions Court verdict filed by Parvez Parwaz, at whose instance the FIR was registered against Adityanath and others.Parwaz had challenged the sessions court's January 28, 2017 decision quashing the Magistrate's order on the grounds that he was not heard by the court. He had argued before the high court that being the informant in the case, he was a necessary party, but the sessions judge had set aside the order without impleading him.The CID had completed its probe in 2015 and sought sanction for prosecution that year.

However, the Gujarat high court acquitted her in April this year."

The crowd, mostly comprising residents of Rangpuri village near Vasant Kunj, were demanding justice for an eight-year-old rape survivor.The girl is undergoing treatment at theAIIMS Trauma Centreafter being assaulted on Wednesday by a 24-year-old man, who abducted her when she was going to the public toilets. Though police arrested the accused, the protestors alleged that the real culprit was at large and the cops had arrested a wrong person.“The man who was arrested was caught while trying to abduct another minor girl. He is not the person who raped the girl, said Rangpuri resident Satish Kumar. “The trouble is the cops are not providing more information on the case.” The people demanded that police hand over the accused to them to be identified and punished.However,Devender Arya, DCP (Southwest), was categorical that there was no secondincidentof the sort and the man arrested was indeed the suspect in the rape. “There was only one call made to the police control room on Wednesday afternoon regarding the rape, and the investigating teams arrested the accused,”Aryareiterated.Eleven people were charged with rioting after the protestors blocked the vital road connecting areas like Vasant Kunj, Kishangarh andChhatarpurwith Mahipalpur and Gurgaon. Just after 7pm, traffic piled up at either end of the stretch and choked NH8. Police officers claimed that they had tried to persuade the crowd to clear the road for traffic and issued warnings as per police protocols.The residents charged police with baton charging them and forcibly evicting them from the road around 10pm. “The cops misbehaved with the women present there and even caned them. In retaliation, some people started pelting stones at the police force, leading to further violence,” Kumar maintained.For their part, the cops present on the scene reported that the villagers started hurling stones from both sides of the road, leading to injuries and damage to police vehicles. As the law and order situation spiralled out of control, the force used tear-gas shells and fired in the air to disperse the agitators. In the skirmish, two assistant commissioners of police, twoinspectorsand seven other personnel suffered injuries, along with scores of the protestors. Later, a case was registered for rioting and the suspects involved in the vandalism detained at Vasant Kunj police station.The locals termed the police crackdown as harsh and uncalled, alleging that the police entered their houses and forcibly took the men away. Many people who were returning from their office were also allegedly attacked by the cops. “They broke down the doors and beat people inside their houses. Whoever was spotted by the police teams ended up being thrashed badly,” alleged a village woman.DCP Arya maintained that police only raided the houses of those suspected to have engaged in stone pelting, attacking cops and damaging vehicles. They were detained after being identified through videos of the incident."

They had hoped for a decision on their plea filed in 2013 in theDelhi high court. But with Justice Gita Mittal’s transfer as chief justice of J&K high court, the bench she headed for dedicated hearing on a batch of appeals and revision petitions stood disbanded, leaving people like 80-year-old Jagdish Kaur — who was hoping for some closure after 34 years — distraught.It means the matter that HC wanted to fast-track will have to be heard “de-novo” (once again) by a new bench, erasing the progress made since January 2017.After taking charge as acting chief justice, Mittal had retained the riot cases she was earlier hearing and fixed every Thursday and Friday of a week for dedicated sessions. The move came after HC took note of the “delay occasioned in adjudication of these matters, which have their genesis in offences of the year 1984” and added that “certainly, a quietus needs to be brought to the entire litigation at the earliest”. But “quietus” appears far fetched for Jagdish and other widows such as Sampooran Kaur who lost their husbands or sons in the riots 35 years ago in riots that broke out inDelhi Cantt areafollowing the assasination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.Jagdish, CBI’s prime witness in the case lost her husband Kehar Singh; elder son Gurpreet and cousins Narinder Pal Singh, Raghuvinder Singh and Kuldeep Singh in the riots. Apprehensive of further delay in the appeal, she had only last month filed an application urging HC to conduct day-to-day hearing to enable an early judgment. “The appellant has withstood the test of time, in as much as it has been 34 years since the tragic and brutal murder of her family members. It is her life’s objective she may see final adjudication of the matter in her life time,” her plea said.These appeals had reached HC after a trial court acquitted Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in 2013 but held five others guilty. While theCBIchallenged Kumar’s acquittal along with the victim families, the latter also demanded enhancement of punishment to the convicted men. These were cases that were re-opened in 2005 on the recommendations of Justice Nanawati Commission leading to registration of FIRs. Speaking to TOI, Nirprit Kaur rued the “missed opportunity” for victims. Kaur, who used to travel from Chandigarh to attend the Thursday/Friday hearings, sounded crestfallen. “We are back to zero, because the matter which had been kept part heard since 2017, will now be heard once again. For Yakub Memon the court can remain open entire night but for us even twice a week we couldn’t get a proper hearing. Loss is ours,” she said.Senior advocate H S Phoolka, who has for years spearheaded the fight for justice, admitted that the victims were very agitated and frustrated due to the delay. “They even wanted to go to the Supreme Court to stop Justice Mittal’s transfer till a judgement was delivered, but I persuaded them not to do it, because she is a good judge,” Phoolka told TOI."

This happened in at least five different spots, he said.“The miscreants projected themselves as participants in the Maratha reservation protest, but had other plans,” the police officer said, adding that the foiled attempts occurred at Jatwada Road in Harsul, Ambedkarnagar on Jalgaon Road, Central Naka, Ajabnagar and Patoda, under the Satara police station jurisdiction. All these attempts occurred just as the protestors were beginning to wind up their activity, he said.At Patoda, the organizer directed his supporters to stand up for the national anthem and concluded his movement. By that time, miscreants pelted buses and private vehicles with stones. In other places, police rushed to the spot and forced the unruly mob to disperse, thwarting the attempt to foment a riot, the police officer said."

The decision of UP government will be final,” Balyan told reporters outside the BJP’s state executive meeting here on Sunday.Months after the state government had sought its opinion on withdrawal of the riot cases in Muzaffarnagar andShamli, the district administration in a letter advised the government that it couldn’t be done.Muzaffarnagardistrict magistrate Rajeev Sharma told TOI, “A letter in this regard was sent 10 days ago. I have advised the government that withdrawal of the riot cases can’t be recommended.”Out of the 184 cases, report on as many as 87 cases was sent to the state government. In the remaining cases, while closure reports in 61 cases had been filed, 26 cases were found registered twice and 10 cases had been disposed by courts, police sources said.“There is a procedure in Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), wherein anyone who is booked under a criminal case, has to apply to the state government for withdrawal of his case. The government then seeks a report from the district administration – which is prepared after close examination of reports that we receive from the police and prosecution. After this, a report citing our opinion is sent to the government. In this case too, we were asked to send a report, which we have already sent,” the Dm said.Sources said that the state government had sent a letter to the district administration on January 17 seeking details of cases, including two cases ofhate speechagainst local BJP MP Sanjeev Balyan, Sadhvi Prachi, BJP’s Bijnor MP Kunwar Bharatendra Singh and BJP MLAs Umesh Malik, Sangeet Singh Som and Suresh Rana.Meanwhile, riot victims and social groups working for them welcomed the district administration’s decision and said that they see a ray of hope for justice.“The government’s decision of withdrawal of riot cases was just like rubbing salt on our wounds. I am glad to know that there are still people in the system who want the accused to face trial,” said Mohammad Zulfikar, a riot victim.Rehana Adeeb who works for the riot victims, said, “People who helped in sparking the riots should be punished for their crimes, come what may.”Local lawyers, however, said the government’s move was a political one.

Her husband naturally tries to bends the situation to his benefit for a luxurious trip to Bangkok with his best friend. Lying about his ailing wife to his boss for a leave, the husband tries to get away with it but is caught in his own trap when his ‘big fat black’ boss decides to pay his ‘sick’ wife a little visit.With the original wife gone, the desperate husband tries to present a fake wife before him and ends up structuring more lies to cover his original one. The hilarious drama that unfolds afterwards was brilliantly enacted by the actors in a Hindi play ‘Marta Kya Na Karta’ which was staged at Sai Sabhagruha, Shankar Nagar, on Saturday.The drama, organized by Prayas Bahu-Uddeshiya Sanstha and written and directed by Priyanka Thakur, staged the problems of a man desperately trying to fix his problems in the comical play and humorously encapsulates the tumbling down of his dominoes of lies.The writer did a splendid job with jotting down a funny script, powerful punch lines complete with quirky twisted lyrics of Bollywood songs.The protagonists Shantanu Thengdi as himself and Sayali Kubde as ‘Kajal’ were a natural as husband and wife. While he charmed the audience with the enactment of a troubled husband falling all over the place, she was convincing as the confused, stereotypical whiny wife. Shantanu ruled the play like it was his realm with his strong stage presence, and in the frames he was not, the space was filled by the supporting actors excellently.Pranali Raut, who played the role of a domestic help to the couple ‘Kolhapurchi Sakku Bai’, fit the role of a loud Maharashtrian-over-the-top maid. Her poor English vocabulary laced with a heavy Marathi accent was a treat to watch and almost instantly built a connect with the spectators.Supporting actors Nikita Thakur, Ashlesha Waghaye, Ashwinin Mandavkar, Siddhant Gautam, Ashu Khatri and Saurabh Masram did a splendid job in the little roles that they played."

Not only did the court find the “rioters in the present case” engaging in violence, they were found to have pelted stones and damaged DTC buses besides injuring a policeman on duty.On July 13, 2013, a mob of 200-250 protesters had blocked traffic at Outer Ring Road in Meera Bagh. The protester allegedly engaged in rioting and sloganeering, besides pelting stones and damaging public property.A head constable, posted at Paschim Vihar police station, became the complainant in the case, claiming a large crowd had gathered and blocked traffic. The police tried to pacify the protesting crowd.“The mob was raising the slogans against Delhi Police. This mob was led by accused Satyendar Jain, Aziz, Nem Singh and others. They were wearing the caps of Aam Aadmi Party,” the police said. When some of the accused instigated other members of the crowd, the mob was “uncontrollable and violent” and began pelting stones on vehicles, police and commuters.“Due to this, some police personnel were injured and some public vehicles were damaged. After great efforts, the mob was controlled by the use of tear gas. Some persons in the mob also had iron rods, clubs, etc. On this complaint, an FIR was registered and the present chargesheet was filed,” it was alleged.The court was of the view that since violence had taken place with police officials on duty, which was evident from the statements of the police officials as well as from their medical reports, a prima facie case under Section 332 of the IPC was made out.“Further, the damage caused to the vehicles attracts the commission of offence under Section 3 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, and the wrongful restraint caused by blocking of road will attract the provisions of 341 of IPC,” the court held. Accordingly it framed charges against all the accused for offences of rioting, being armed with deadly weapon, and damage to public property and unlawful assembly."

Her latest titleFrom Twinkle, WithLoveis also a romance embedded in the immigrant territory where she explores themes of love, identity, and culture in the most hilarious manner.From Twinkle, With Lovefollows 16-year-old Twinkle Mehra, an aspiring filmmaker. Like all cliched American teenage movies, Twinkle is a wallflower, since she loves holding a camera more than a make-up brush. She's also in love with Neil, a boy in her high school who barely knows she exists. Twinkle is also struggling with her ""ultra-rich"" BFF Maddie. There is Sahil, Neil's twin who seems to be smitten by Twinkle. When Sahil loops in Twinkle on a filmmaking project, she starts receiving mysterious letters from an admirer signed 'N', and Twinkle convinces herself that it's Neil. Though the plot seems done and dusted, the narrative is fresh and energetic.Menon tells Twinkle's tale through letters that she writes as confessions to several filmmakers. This epistolary method integrates well into the story but it does not, however, make the plot more pronounced. For lovers of this genre, the book is a delightful read; for everyone else, nothing beyond a high school chick-lit. But there is one thing that none can deny: the book is a laugh riot.How critics view the book:KirkusReviewswrites, ""Menon’s sophomore effort is a charming and sophisticated rom-com that outshines her previous outing.""Publisher's Weeklywrites in areview, ""Menon brings an effervescent energy to Twinkle’s story, which is reminiscent in tone to Menon’sWhen Dimple Met Rishi."""

He also questioned the unity among opposition parties, which he said were locked in regional squabbles.Speaking in the debate on the no-trust motion, Singh hit out at Congress MPShashi Tharoorfor his “Hindu Pakistan” remark and said, “Where do they (Congress) want to take the country and what does it want India to become? Here, there is talk of HinduTaliban. India is the only country where minorities are prospering. Do they not want such an India?”Referring to lynching incidents, Singh said the Centre would provide all assistance required but state governments should take stringent steps to curb such incidents. “The biggest incident of mob lynching happened in 1984,” Singh said, referring to the anti-Sikh riot in the aftermath of PM Indira Gandhi’s assassination on October 31, 1984.Singh said, “Who are you bringing a no-confidence against? The appeal of the PM is such that several people gave up gas subsidies after he urged them to do so. They are bringing a no-trust motion against the government but they (the opposition) do not trust each other. And who is their leader… when it comes to talking about the leadership, then they lose steam.”Expressing displeasure at the opposition’s move to bring a no-trust motion despite numbers favouring the NDA, Singh said BJP never thought of doing something similar while in opposition from 2004-2014 as it was convinced that then PMManmohan Singhwas safe and also because it considered opposition to be a legitimate part of democracy, which needed to play it role.Taking a dig at Congress, Singh said former PMRajiv Gandhihad ridiculed BJP for having two MPs in Lok Sabha in 1984. “One should not be arrogant as time changes and the same party (BJP) today has a majority in Parliament,” he added."

What’s more, they almost faced the trial for the second time but were eventually spared thedouble jeopardythanks to the judge who remembered having acquitted them earlier. The four finally walked free but not before spending a week in jail due to the goof-up by courts.According to the case details, a Muslim mob targeted an autorickshaw near the Asarwa flyover on February 28, 2002. Five persons — Imamuddin Shaikh,Saeed Rangrez,Jamilkhan Pathan, Ahmed Rangrez andMehbub Shaikh— were charged with arson, rioting and attempt to murder. The chargesheet remained with the magisterial court for almost seven years.Of the five accused, only Mehbub Shaikh attended court proceedings while four others did not respond to court warrants. On December 24, 2008, a metropolitan court delinked Mehbub’s case from the rest and ordered Madhavpura police to file a separate chargesheet against the other four accused. It sent only Mehbub’s case to the sessions court for trial.It so happened that additional sessions judge Nipa Rawal issued summons to all five accused instead of Mehbub alone.They appeared before the sessions court and the trial against them took place. All of them were acquitted on January 25 this year for want of evidence.Meanwhile, on the directions of metropolitan court, Madhavpura police filed a separate chargesheet against the four accused in the same case. The magistrate issued warrants against them in February. They were arrested in the first week of March and produced before the metropolitan court.Bail order left jail authorities confusedEverybody was confused. We told the court that all four accused in the separate chargesheet were already acquitted in this case by a sessions court. But the magisterial court had a new chargesheet, which it had not committed to the sessions court,” said advocate R J Solanki, who appeared for the accused. The four then moved a bail application. “When we finally convinced the metropolitan court, the issue of jurisdiction came up as the sessions court has power to grant bail in such cases,” said Solanki.The case again reached the sessions judge who had acquitted all the accused just a month ago. She recollected the case and immediately granted bail on March 7. She also sought an explanation from the police about the second chargesheet in the case. “When we gave the bail order to the jail authorities, it left them confused. We had to go back to the court to obtain proper directions. Until the air was cleared, the accused had to remain behind bars,” the advocate said.As if this was not enough, the metropolitan court committed the new chargesheet against four accused to the sessions court for trial. However, the sessions court quickly decided that no further order was required in this case and put a full stop to it on March 15."

The arrangement was in response to the “organised cheating” witnessed in the same examination conducted in March this year which was subsequently scrapped. Jaipur city, where 209 examination centres have been set up, was most affected by the ‘digital curfew’ as many could not book cabs, check online status of their trains, buses or flights.‘Shops shut due to fear of rampage’Many shops remained closed fearing rampage by the huge crowd of young people in the city.“The last time I faced such an ordeal was in September last year when there was tension in Ramganj and internet was suspended. I had to catch a train but couldn’t book a cab to reach the station. I had to call up my cousin in Delhi to book the cab and check the train status,” said Sarita Sharma, a Jaipur resident.Cheating mafias had rigged an earlier test held in March this year, forcing the state to scrap the exam and hold it once again. A relentless operation, which began two weeks ago, to nab the cheating gangs resulted in the arrest of nearly 50 suspects. They were involved in “helping” candidates by arranging impersonators and providing question papers before the test.So, the police department walked the extra mile this time around to assure a “cheating-free” recruitment process even though it amounted to “high-handedness” that caused large-scale disruption in internet communication."

On Friday, officials reiterated the Authority will clean the city’s garbage and dump it at the Mubarkpur village site over the next week. Meanwhile, police have slapped various cases, including that of rioting, on 23 protesters arrested on Thursday.Rajesh Singh, the officer on special duty to Noida Authority, said that the city “generates 600 tonnes of solid waste every day”. “The workers have started picking up garbage from sectors and dumping them at theMubarakpursite. We are storing the garbage scientifically and also spraying medicines to ensure they do not stink. We hope to clean the city of garbage in one week,” he told TOI.Police said the 23 people arrested on Thursday for protesting against the dumping ground in Mubarakpur village have been charged with serious charges of rioting, obstructing public servants from discharging duty, threat of injury of public servants, wrongful consignment, voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult to provoke breach of peace and criminal intimidation.Manoj Kumar Pant, SHO ofSurajpurpolice station, said cases were registered against the accused, including local Congress functionary Raghuraj Singh, following a complaint by the Noida Authority. The complaint says that sanitation workers had stopped collecting garbed from sectors for the last five days over the confusion over waste site. “There was fear about public outburst. Due to monsoon season, there is also a high chance of vector borne diseases due to garbage,” it says.According to the FIR, Noida Authority decided to store the solid waste at the site but a group of around 70-80 people armed with sticks and canes reached the spot and damaged the plastic sheet which was spread on the ground for garbage disposal.“Some protesting members also climbed over the earthmovers and halted the work. They also threatened the workers that they would be dumped on the spot if they dump garbage at the site. Some had even manhandled the sanitation workers,” the FIR says.Though Raghuraj Singh and five others were released on bail from the police station, 17 others have been sent to 14-day judicial custody.

But butterflies have more to them than just being a visual delight. They play the role of pollinators, balance the food chain and their behaviour, population and migration patterns help ecologists gauge the impact of environmental issues like climate change, deforestation and low rainfall.Keeping these aspects in mind, the state forest department has come out with a coffee table book titled ‘Butterflies of Tamil Nadu’. The book was released on Tuesday, coinciding with the International Day for Biological Diversity. The book documents 312 species of butterflies of the 323 species found inTamil Nadu. “The last book on butterflies was published in 2005 by Dr Guathilagaraj who documented only 90 species in south India,” says N Satheesh, conservator of forests.Satheesh says his team began research for the book two years ago. P Mohanprasath, a butterfly enthusiast and a photographer, has co-authored the book with Satheesh. As part of their research for the book, the team visited the forests in Coimbatore and Aanamalai Tiger Reserve inPollachi, a part of the Western Ghats as well as Amrithi forests inVelloreandSathyamangalam Tiger Reservein the Eastern Ghats besides visiting Srivilliputhur. “We identified around 32 butterfly hotspots where one can see at least 75 species,” Satheesh says.Around 32 species such as southern birdwing, malabar rose, Tamil catseye, Nilgiri clouded yellow, Nilgiri grass yellow and Malabar banded peacock are endemic to the Western Ghats. Rare species include orange owlet, yellow breasted flat, manytailed oakblue and Shiva sunbeam.“Butterflies are grouped into five families — Papilionidae, Pieridae, Numphalidae, Lycaenidae and Hesperidae. Many species use camouflage, mimicking and warning signals to escape predators. Species such as monarch and painted lady can travel long distances during their migratory period,” Satheesh says. “The wings of butterflies are made up of tiny scales which help them fly and are responsible for their colours,” he adds.The country’s diverse terrain, vegetation, climate and distinct seasons attract butterflies in large numbers. Satheesh, however, rues that environmental threats like pollution and pesticides are triggering a decline in the butterfly population. To fight it, the state has created a Tropical Butterfly Conservatory at Trichy, spread over 25 acres, and a butterfly park at Vandalur zoo. Satheesh says butterfly conservation will help in improving the environment in a big way. The book contains tips in this regard.Sensitising young children on butterfly conservation, watching butterflies regularly, starting butterfly gardens at home, school, workplace; educating farmers to use native seeds and shun pesticides; and participating in butterfly walks and surveys are a few ways through which common people can contribute their mite.Email your feedback to southpole.toi@timesgroup.com"

One can imagine the extent of failure of police’s local intelligence gathering mechanism as the clashes continued for over 90 minutes before a private person called up the control room.”Anil Chordiye, an oil trader who has been running a shop in the area for almost two decades, said, “The incident around 9.15 pm — the time when I closed my shop for the day. Police reached the spot only around 10.30 pm.”He said that although three vehicles, each carrying three policemen, reached Motikaranja, hardly any of them took action against the mobs that were on the rampage.Echoing Chordiye’s views, his neighbour for two decades, Anwar Khan alias Mamu, said, “Had police reached the spot earlier and acted against the miscreants from both the sides, the communal violence would not have spread to neighbouring areas.”A resident of Gandhinagar said on the condition of anonymity that police reached the spot and parked their vehicles dividing the two areas. “Initially they did not act against the stone-pelters from both the sides.”Assistant commissioner of police Anita Jamadar, said, “As per the records, the first distress call informing about clashes was received by the control room at 10.22 pm, following which City Chowk as well as Kranti Chowk police stations were informed about it.”As per the call logs, City Chowk police inspector Hemant Kadam was the first to reach the spot, followed by assistant commissioner of police Govardhan Kolekar and Kranti Chowk inspector Shripad Paropkari. Within 15 minutes of these officers reaching the spot, serious stone-throwing started and a sharp stone hit ACP Kolekar, rupturing his throat and seriously injuring his windpipe.When contacted, DCP (headquarters) Deepali Dhate, head of the fact-finding SIT, said, “We are probing the exact cause of the incident, what time the violence started, who all are responsible, how it did spread to neighbouring areas, when did police learn about it and reach the spot and what was their response at the venue.”"

While former Chief Justice JN Patel will preside over it, Mullick will be a member.RTIactivists have taken objection to the appointment of Mullick, saying he should quit the CIC assignment and take the job under the Commission of Inquiry Act.Ex-Central Information CommissionerShailesh Gandhicalled Mullick’s appointment untenable, unethical, bad in law and bad for the government. “I am shocked. There will be clear conflict of interest, since in the future questions on the Bhima-Koregaon probe may be raised before him in his capacity as CIC. In my opinion, in the larger public interest Mullick should give up one of the two posts,” Gandhi said.Pune-based RTI activistVijay Kumbharsaid the appointment of Mullick as member of the judicial commission was illegal. “Under provisions of law, a CIC cannot take up any other assignment as it’s a quasi-judicial assignment. If he continues as a member of the judicial commission, it will be a mockery of the landmark RTI Act,” Kumbhar said.Kumbhar said at a juncture when more than 36,000 appeals are pending across the state and 5,288 before the CIC, it was wrong on the part of Mullick to take up another assignment. “My information is that Mullick’s new assignment will be a full-time job, so he may not be able to devote time as CIC,” Kumbhar said.Mullick defended himself, saying he will ensure there is no injustice done to his role as CIC. “I will do justice to both assignments. I will sit for more hours and ensure that pending appeals under the RTI Act are disposed of in a time-bound mannter,” Mullick said.Justice Patel too defended his appointment, saying the commission’s work schedule has been drafted in such a way that CIC’s routine work will not be affected. “We will sit on Saturdays, Sundays and on public holidays.

Munde has demanded judicial inquiry into the incident and appealed to the government to give Rs 25 lakh as compensation to the families of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh to the injured.Going a step ahead, Munde also demanded resignation of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “The police officers who suppressed the intelligence reports about the preparation of riots should not only face serious action, but also be suspended with immediate effect,” he said during his visit to the riot-hit areas of the old city.The Congress leader also claimed that the police had the intelligence information about the riots almost couple of months before it triggered on Friday.Munde said these were not riots between two communities, but basically violence triggered as one of the demands for extortion made by a sitting corporator’s kin were not being met by the traders, fruit merchants and vegetable hawkers.“It is indeed shameful that police just stood their ground and did nothing when the hooligans resorted to arson and stone pelting. The riot happened because of the ignorance of police,” he said,Criticizing the chief minister further, Munde said, “Why did he (Fadnavis) not visit Aurangabad? He sent the minister of state to take stock of the situation when he knows that MoS does not have any rights to take action.”"

An officer said, “We are yet to find strong evidence indicating that the riots were pre-planned. So far, it appears to be spontaneous action and reaction by groups.”The officer said that there is evidence that people from both the sides were prepared in whatever manner they could as they feared attacks.Sources said the SIT has found that the civic body has allegedly been carrying out frequent actions against a particular community, creating a feeling of victimisation, following which some people reportedly did some preparations for facing any untoward situation.An officer with the SIT said, “Some youths have revealed that they obtained sharp-edged weapons to face attacks in the wake of riots in the city.”The SIT is also probing as to why the special units and vehicles like Vajra, Varun and others were not used during the violence that was triggered by a dispute between the residents of Gandhi Nagar and Motikaranja over snapping of illegal water supply to a shrine."

Ice cream stalls and salad counters with 20 types of foreign fruits bore the brunt of the annoyed revellers. People were seen running with ice cream bricks, fruits and plates in their hands. Even some RJD workers were seen running with sticks to chase away the ‘intruders’. The only saving grace was that the bride and groom’s families and the VIPs had left the venue.An RJD man told TOI on Sunday that a rumour had spread that tastier food items were in the VVIP pavilion.The ‘vandalism’ exposed the lack of preparedness for the grand wedding. It also raised question over Lalu’s younger sonTejashwi Prasad Yadav’s managementas he had formed committees of RJD functionaries to look after the arrangements.RJD leaders admitted lack of management for the mega ceremony, which was attended by at least 20,000 people.“Such a lack of discipline is common in social functions of Lalu’s family. The coordinators and organizing committee members were nowhere seen after the ‘jaimala’ started,” another RJD functionary said and added, “Apart from thousands of invitees, tens of hundreds of local youths, mostly mischief mongers, had also come for free food. In fact, they were involved in the vandalism.”Political observers claimed the incident also revived the infamous memories associated with a couple of marriages in Lalu’s family. Around 50 cars and pieces of new furniture were taken away from showrooms in Patna for the wedding function of Lalu’s eldest daughter Misa Bharti in December 1999.JD(U) was quick to target Lalu and his family. “The incident showed the original traits and culture of RJD and its workers. If Lalu and his family are not able to control their own ‘rowdy’ workers, how can they claim to govern a state,” JD (U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said, adding Lalu should have avoided making his son’s wedding a political event.Rahul Gandhi extended best wishesCongress chief Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra did not attend Tej’s wedding even though his sisters Raj Lakshmi Yadav and Ragini Yadav had personally invited Sonia Gandhi for the event. Rahul, however, had extended his good wishes over the phone to Lalu and his family on Saturday afternoon. “Rahul had calledTejashwiand talked to Lalu ji and Rabri ji as well. He said he could not make it to the wedding due to engagements related to Karnataka elections,” a close aide of Tejashwi told TOI. Bihar Congress’s in charge Shaktisinh Gohil and the party’s officiating president of the state Kaukab Quadri had met Lalu on Saturday evening to extend their wishes."

Twenty-three Muslims were burnt alive in the Ode town in Anand district in central Gujarat.In 2012, the SIT court had found 23 persons guilty and awarded life imprisonment to 18 persons for murder, criminal conspiracy, rioting and arson. Five others were punished with seven-year jail term for attempt to murder, rioting and other offences. The trial court had acquitted 23 persons in this case. All the accused in this case belonged to the Patidar community.Of the 18 persons condemned to life imprisonment, a bench of Justice Akil Kureshi andJustice B N Kariaconfirmed conviction of 14 persons and maintained their sentence as awarded by the trial court. The HC acquitted three – Dilip Patel, Punam Patel andNatubhai Patel. The HC also upheld punishment of five other convicts. One convictHarish Vallabhbhai Patelpassed away in jail.The incident had taken place on March 1, 2002 in Pirawali Bhagol area of Ode town. The victims had taken refuge in a house, which was torched by the violent mob charring 23 persons mostly women and children to death. Only two dead bodies could be recovered from the house while the rest were burnt so badly that their bodies could not be identified leading to police declaring 21 people as missing.In its judgment, the HC condemned communal violence that proves devastating for families of victims and accused as well. “This phenomenon which we often describe as communal frenzy turn perfectly normal human beings momentarily into murderous monsters leaving nothing but trail of death and destruction for the victims and his own family alike,” the court observed.The court said, “We have seen senselessness of violence and loss of innocent human lives. We cannot imagine the pain suffered by the victims who perished in the raging fire. We cannot judge the depth of sorrow and despair that the members of the families of the victims would have felt while helplessly watching their relatives being killed in front of their eyes in most gruesome manner.” The HC also described agony of accused persons’ families during lengthy legal proceedings.Besides the HC confirmed acquittal of 23 persons and rejected the state government’s demand for death penalty for those who had got life term. The HC refused to treat the case in the rarest of the rare category and said, “We do not find that the accused are beyond reformation. There is nothing to suggest that when eventually released after serving out the entire sentence, they would still be a threat to the society. In other words, we do not find a situation where death is the only option, snuffing out the human life the only possibility.”"

During the protest, the party members reportedly clashed with the cops disrupting the law and order situation. Following the repeated summon and no response from the six politicians, the court issued a non-bailable warrant against them. Taking note of which Upadhyay, Harak and four others got bail from the court on April 24."

The process of gathering intelligence from all the possible sources and channels is very much under way.”Starting from the first week of January, the city police’s special branch has been caught on the back foot in cases of rioting and tension.Immediately in the wake of violence in Koregaon Bhima on January 1-2, parts of Aurangabad witnessed some protests and law and order situation. Mobile internet services were suspended for the first time in city for a period of 24 hours in January. The decision was taken by the home department with the help of telecom operators in order to avoid spread of rumours and hate messages.In February, villagers in Padegaon-Mitmita created ruckus over dumping of garbage in their vicinity. What’s worse, CCTV footage of the violence that day revealed that police personnel had also indulging in violence. A CCTV camera installed at a house in the area showed a woman constable picking up stones and throwing them at houses. She is soon joined in the stone-pelting by both female and male colleagues.Police sources said that the key suspect in the Friday night rioting and some others have been trying to disrupt communal harmony over the past few weeks. The city police and its intelligence mechanism was keeping track of their actions, but failed to read the situation.On the long weekend following April 28, when there were four public holidays, a group of miscreants, reached a Wakf Board owned structure and demolished its walls by claiming ownership of the land. The market value of the area runs into crores of rupees.This action caused considerable communal tension in the area. Incidentally, the Begumpura police station chief as well as senior police officers in the city were on leave when the suspects reached the spot to take possession of land.Over the past couple of weeks, some people have been demanding shifting of the hawkers from the City Chowk, Gandhi Statue and Shahgunj market to far off place of Aamkhas ground during month of Ramazan. These hawkers and the market area is being set up at these locations of decades during the month of Ramazan. The demand coming from some quarters had caused much unease, sources said.A few days back, the same suspect citing a petty issue created a public scene in Shahgunj area by turning the fruit hawkers carts upside down, causing serious loss to the poor fruit merchants.Sources said that the miscreants have been under the scanner for a while, but they seem to have found an opportunity on Friday. The incidents on Friday related to removal of illegal water connection to religious sites played in their hands and they took advantage of the situation, police sources said.The city police chief denied there had been any intelligence failure. He said that there was intelligence about law and order situation, but the police were not very sure of the timings of the same."

Police arrested 10 people, but all of them turned out to be labourers working for the mining kingpin.“Police action, which are far and few, just stops with arresting such pawns,” says Prabhakaran.Whenever police claim they have caught a sand smuggler, it would invariably be the driver of the truck laden with illegally quarried sand. It is no secret that the driver is just a foot soldier and the last link in the chain. Others in the maze of network from police officials, bureaucrats and politicians are never brought to book. If the police-sand mafia nexus is the prime reason for the big fish escaping, absence of sharper laws also contributes to the scenario.Activists say imprisonment would deter the drivers and force them to reveal the names of their operators. But they are let off with just a penalty. The penalty is paid by the mafia and the driver walks free without any compulsion to reveal the names of the kingpins. The truck would also be registered in the name of someone else, hiding the identity of the kingpin. As a norm, the trucks are also released after penalty is paid.M Appavu, formerMLAof Radhapuram in Tirunelveli, al,leges that it is indeed the corrupt lot in the police department who are helping illegal sand mining thrive. “Forget about stopping illegal sand mining, when someone gets murdered for attempting to stop quarrying, police don’t bring to book the culprits,’’ he says.Upright police officials who tend to take action face several stumbling blocks. “The first stumbling block comes from within our own department and we are isolated as cracking down on the sand mafia will dry up the monthly bribe. In most cases, honest officials will be shunted out to other areas,’’ says a DSP.Police also point out legal handicaps in bringing to book the kingpins. A police officer said more often the drivers of the sand trucks will escape as soon as police round them up. “The truck alone will be seized and handed over to the revenue department. Bogus bills will be presented claiming the sand was purchased from a depot,’’ he said.I Gopalsamy of the Tamirabarani Protection Movement says there is no stringent legal deterrent. “Only one in 100 smugglers is caught. The penalty equals the value of only one or two loads of sand he smuggles. The truck owner pays it and resumes smuggling,’’ he pointed out.R Sakthivel, anti–mining activist from Palamadai in Tirunelveli, said that after repeated complaints that were ignored, he approached senior officials with proof of the nexus between sand mafia and police. “I had sent telephone records of a few police inspectors who regularly talked to mining kingpins. Senior officials had no choice to but to take action,’’ he said.Velloresuperintendent of police P Pakalavan, however, said police are doing their best. He said they have been conducting regular checks in and around sand smuggling prone areas in the Palar river such as Walajapet, Ranipet and Thakkolam. Apart from this, surprise checks in transit points of the Vellore-Chennai roads have been carried out often.It resulted in the arrest of a total of 511sand smugglersin 710 cases since January this year.(With inputs from J Shanmugasundaram and M K Ananth)"

The rationale the state government gave was that it would protect people from being forcibly evicted by members of other religions in areas where there was communal tension.The petitioners, Nishant Varma and Danish Qureshi, contended that this law is against the Constitution and violates citizens’ rights. The contended that the state government had failed to maintain communal harmony in Gujarat, if such a law was required. They held that there may be hurdles to establishing peace, but the government cannot seek refuge in such a law.The petitioners cited Gujarat’s reports to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has been consistently showing that the state does not witnesscommunal violenceat a higher rate than other states. The situation is not alarmingly disturbing in Gujarat.On the other hand, the state government has been increasing coverage of the law to cover more localities across the state. This raises the issue that if the NCRB reports are true and communal harmony prevails in Gujarat, then there is no need for the Disturbed Areas Act.The petitioners alleged that the state government has stuck to this law and is adding more areas to it to further its political agenda and not because it is necessary, Qureshi said.This petition is likely to come up for hearing on Friday."

Women no longer spark laugh riot on screen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/women-no-longer-spark-laugh-riot-on-screen/articleshow/63979234.cms,"Chennai news, Chennai latest news, Chennai news live, Chennai news today, Today news Chennai, Women,wit,Tamil cinema,Slapstick,comedy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//static.toiimg.com/photo/34824568.cms,"Chennai: The 1968 blockbuster ‘Thillana Mohanambal’, starring Sivaji Ganesan and Padmini in the lead roles, was a love story with a battle of egos, but thousands of film buffs also remember it for warm-hearted Jil Jil Ramamani who lifted the cloud of seriousness every time she appeared on screen. It is etched in the minds of cinemagoers as one of actor Manorama’s best performances. But comic flavour in films, a hallmark of the black and white and Eastman-colour era, seems to be slowly fading away.Word play, comic timing and intonation in dialogue delivery, ingredients that would pepper scripts and lighten up screens, have dwindled especially for women, since the time of Manorama and Sowcar Janaki. Laughter today seems to be limited to caricatures, rib-tickling humour replaced by stereotypicalslapstickand witty repartees bywomencharacters with vulgar demeaning jokes.With hardly any screenplay venturing beyond the main plot to infuse perceptive levity, the absence of comic brilliance in women characters may be felt for a long time. ""To break the monotony of watching the main characters, writers earlier would have 15 to 16 scenes just for comedians,"" points out actor-director and playwright T S B K Moulee.Over the years, the demands of commercial cinema and shorter run time have resulted in such scenes being chopped off. Today,comedyis about body shaming women and putting down their intelligence, feels Moulee. ""The hero’s friend (usually a comedian) and the hero tease the heroine and this is what we are told is comedy."" While male comedians are still popular as the hero’s confidante, a heroine no longer has such companions. ""A male comedian has created a strong image in the market that in comedy a woman should only be teased for her appearance. Charlie Chaplin made me laugh by showing his sufferings, but inTamil cinema, the actor makes the audience laugh by making fun of the women with misogynistic jokes,"" says actor Maya Krishnan, who feels very few scripts are written with woman comedians in mind.Ruing that cinema per se has denigrated women, Sowcar Janaki feels intelligent comedy is out these days and cinema no longer has space for women comedians. ""Comedy now is all about body shaming and delivering vulgar dialogues. There can’t be another Manorama,"" says the actor who began her career as a tragedy queen. She later realised the comic streak in her and made the transition that made such gems as ‘Bhama Vijayam’, ‘Thillu Mullu’ and ‘Ethir Neechal’ sparkle.Apart from her inherent talent, she credits the change to directors like K Balachander, who helped her reach her potential. ""What can I say? I was there at the right place and with the right people. My theatre background helped a lot in shaping my comic streak,"" says Janaki, who feels actors today are no longer given the space to explore comedy.While the industry has made way for the Santhanams, Karunas, and Viveks, it seems to have lost the plot midway with regard to women comedians. This absence is further felt when upcoming actors limit themselves to the typical heroine’s role. Today, if women cannot make it as heroines, they fade away since they do not have the opportunity to hone their talent in comic roles. A change should happen and veterans must take the lead by urging actors to explore offbeat roles, say experts.In the 1980s, actors like Sripriya, Radikaa and Revathi were not only popular for portraying the love interest in blockbusters but were also known for their bubbly heartwarming characters with great comic timing.The torchbearer among women comedians, in recent times, is probably actor Kovai Sarala. Having acted in more than 750 films, she has been able to portray different characters in movies like ‘Cheena Veedu’, ‘Karagattakaran’, and ‘Kaalam Maari Pochu’, and is an example of how an actor, harbouring dreams to play the heroine, could still become a star by cashing in on her comic timing.But does this mean the end of quirky comebacks by women? Actor and playwright ‘Crazy’ Mohan is positive that the tide will change. ""The popularity of comic roles comes in cycles. The requirement for female comedians will come again. The industry needs more women writers and that can bring about a change,"" he says."

The massacre occurred on February 28, 2002 and the trial commenced in 2009 in the special investigation team (SIT) court.‘Discrepancies brushed aside’The high court also observed that the trial court in convicting Maya Kodnani had simply accepted the testimonies of all the witnesses brushing aside the discrepancies in their evidence. The court said: “…if around the same timeMayabencame in a car and left, how could she be present in the mob.”Besides, the court pointed out that while some witnesses said Kodnani arrived alone in her car, others said she was accompanied by her PA. Other witnesses said she was accompanied by Bipin Panchal, Murli Sindhi andGuddu Chhara.“No investigation has been carried out by the SIT to ascertain whether Kodnani owned or was using any such vehicle at the relevant time, nor has it attempted to trace the vehicle,” the court observed in its verdict. “This is a serious lacuna in the investigation by the SIT because all evidence against Kodnani has come only at the stage when the SIT came into the picture, therefore it was the duty of the SIT to gather evidence in support of the versions given by the witnesses.”The high court refused to believe any of the 11witnesses, who were residents of Naroda Patia, claiming their discrepant testimonies cannot be reconciled for Kodnani."

It is a guarantee that no communal riot will take place in that region for another 10 years.”According to police, Devi shared the post despite a strict warning issued by police, which had warned people against writing or sharing inflammatory posts on social media.Soon after receiving the complaint, Muzaffarnagar senior superintendent of police (SSP)Anant Deo Tiwaridirected the in-charge of Civil Lines police station to register a case.“A case has been registered against Lalita Devi under section 66 of the IT Act.

This happened because it is mandatory for all accused to be present before the court when charges are framed. And, there has not been a single time in those 50 court hearings when all the 14 were present at once.The accused include sittingBJPMPs Sanjeev Balyan (Muzaffarnagar) and Kunwar Bhartendra (Bijnor), serving UP cabinet minister and Thanabhawan MLA Suresh Rana and Sadhvi Prachi, who were booked under IPC’s sections 147 (rioting), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, etc.), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty).The case (number 173/2013) is among 131 cases that UP government had announced to withdraw in March this year, kicking up a political storm.According to Chandraveer Singh, defence lawyer in the case, “Chargesheet in this case was filed in June 2014 and ever since, the court has not been able to frame charges against the accused because they failed to make appearance all at once.”On Friday, when the court of additional civil judgeRitu Nagarheld its 50th hearing, it couldn’t again frame the charges as Suresh Rana, Bhartendra and Sadhvi Prachi were absent.Delay in justice, meanwhile, is weakening the resolve of the victims’ relatives to continue their long fight.Rehana Adeeb, director, Astitva Foundation that works for the rehabilitation of riot victims in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli, said, “These are just delaying tactics. After acquittal of Swami Aseemanand (accused inMecca Masjidblast) andMaya Kodnani(accused in Gujarat riots), our faith in judiciary is fast corroding. It’s just a matter of time when Muzaffarnagar riot cases will also end up like that.”When asked about his absence, Bijnor MP Kunwar Bhartendra told TOI, “First of all, these cases were politically motivated. So anyway, they are going to die their natural death. That much said, I have always been very regular in the hearings. Only during parliament sessions or important engagements, I excuse myself from appearance in the court. For instance, on Friday, I was with a large number of villagers for providing them with gas connections after directions from Prime Minister’s Office.”"

It has given a week's time for the report to be furnished.The letter dated March 29 and signed by UP home secretary Bhagwan Swarup (a copy of which is with TOI) has directed the DGP office and divisional commissioners to collate information and data on all exoduses up to February 28, 2017 to the home department.The issue of exodus was first raised byKairanaMP, late Hukum Singh, in June 2016 when he submitted a list of 250 Hindu families which, he claimed, had to leave the town due to fear of members of a particular community “in majority in the area”. A National Human Rights Commission report later validated his claims.The issue became a major controversy in the run-up to assembly polls in UP with the BJP accusing the Samajwadi Party, which was in power then, of pursuing a minority appeasement policy. Later, it found prominent place in the BJP’s election manifesto, with top leaders including party chief Amit Shah andYogi Adityanathraising it time and again.In the strongly worded letter, the government has also reprimanded senior officials for not taking the matter seriously despite the fact that similar “directions had been issued” in a previous letter dated June 20, 2017.“It must be noted that whatever information was provided in this matter did not corroborate either with media reports or with public sentiments, particularly in west UP from where reports of exodus came. This signifies that neither senior officials at the headquarters level took notice of the directions nor any investigation was conducted in this regard,” the letter says.Divisional commissioner (Meerut) Prabhat Kumar acknowledged the letter. He said: “We have received this letter. But that kind of information is asked routinely and we forwarded it to the DMs concerned and other departments.”Meerut SSPManzil Sainiadded, “This is an old matter and since the information was not provided then, a fresh letter has been issued. We have already sent our report to the government. We have not witnessed any exodus in Meerut as such.”"

The orange gives way to shocking red which merges with the lilac. An eye-catching royal blue imbues a broken wooden door with a mysterious sense of life. Smudged white fills up the worn-out planks of the door to create a design that defies decay. If you hadn’t only minutes earlier hopped over fly-infested drains and negotiated pockmarked paths, you would think you were looking at a modern art installation. But this isSanjay Camp, a slum lying hidden behind Chanakyapuri’s tony environs.From the tree-lined avenues of Moti Bagh, Sanjay Camp looks like any other disadvantaged area. But within the urban underbelly where 2,200 families live, there is now a colourful world of street art. From flowers and animals tocartoonsfigures and expressions of empowerment and education, the walls of Sanjay Camp are symbols of brave dignity. Residents emerge from the shanties to boast about their houses. A shy Anita gestures at her house and says, “Log kehtey hain tumhara ghar sabsey sundar hai.”A short distance away a woman looks at the painting on her walls as she collects water from a pipeline. The artwork portrays the thought provoking words of a woman: “Jism khareed saktey ho, lekin rooh nahin (You can buy a body, but not the soul).”This colourriothappened on March 17 and 18, when over 400 young people of Delhi University — current and former students, many associated with the art and social service societies of the university colleges — converged on the slum to give new colour to life in Sanjay Camp. This coming together was steered by P M Shivani and Isham Sethi, both graduates of Sri Venkateswara College, who formed Button Mushrooms to put art on the pedestal it deserves while contributing their bit to the society. They called this project to paint the 700 brick-and-metal sheet houses “Kachi Gali...rang desh ke” and managed to get thecolourssponsored by a paint manufacturing company.“Initially when we told the residents that we would paint their houses, they laughed at us,” Shivani told TOI. “When we reached the place with the paints, people did not step forward to help. But when we started painting their houses, they were delighted to see the results and made space for our artists to work with ease.” This fulfilling experience has made Shivani hopeful of being able to mobilise support for more such activities.Sanjay camp is not the sole example of street art. In another slum in Okhla, which also goes by the name of Sanjay Camp, students from various colleges are using street art in bright shades to give the undistinguished brick structures a new sheen while simultaneously creating awareness about cleanliness. A group of 18, led byAbhishek Jain, a student of Vivekanand Institute of Professional Studies, has taken up the work under the banner of Navaagat (new era), which the students have established to take up social causes.When TOI visited the slum, the baby steps that these youngsters were taking had already begun to show results. A small open area where students usually gather to study now has wall paintings surrounding it.Indraprastha Collegestudents worked on the flawless graffiti and students fromRamanujan Collegehelped raise the required funds. Jain disclosed that they also managed to raise additional funds for the colours through crowd funding.Navaagat, with the help of community members, has managed to give the nearly 200 houses there a new coat of colour, and in the process the message of a clean neighbourhood has gone out far and wide. A sense of pride is evident as housewife Shamim show off the art on her walls.There was another fallout of the newly inspiring atmosphere in Okhla’s Sanjay Camp. “After the graffiti came up on the walls, some men who had ever proved a public nuisance because they indulged in open gambling were evicted by the community. Obviously the people now feel a sense of responsibility towards their locality,” said Jain."

The gangs had clashed to gain control over bootlegging and other illegal businesses in the area.Police sub-inspector K D Raval was thrashed by a group of drunk men under the limits of Amroli police station on March 22 when he had asked them not to use foul language.The rioting was started by history-sheeter Lalu Jalim alias Amit Rajput and his associates. Rajput was earlier working for a history-sheeter from Amroli Jacob Rabari. After Rabari’s death, Rajput stared operating his own gang and began extorting money from anti-social elements in Kosad EWS Colony.Crime branch sleuths arrested Rajput and his associate Mamu Machhi on Saturday. They are being questioned by the police about the rioting.Police investigations revealed that Rajput’s men attacked gangster Hasim and his associates in Kosad in the early hours of Friday after which both gang members resorted to stone-pelting. Some stones fell on a religious structure of a particular community and this led to communal clash in the area. On March 27, Hasim and his gang members had torched the fish shop of Radheshyam Machhi, who later approached Rajput for help. Hasim and Rajput had developed differences over extorting money frombootleggersoperating in the area.Rajput was in jail since May 2017 after his arrest in a murder case. Rajput became known as a gangster in the area after the murder. He also attacked a crime branch team in May 2017.He came out on temporary bail fromLajpore Central Jaila week ago and had fired from an airgun during aRama Navamiprocession in Limbayat area. He was arrested for the offence but got released on bail.“Actually it was a fight between the two gangs. In both the gangs, men from different communities are active. It was initially not a communal clash, but later some people from both the communities got involved in the violence. However, police brought the situation under control immediately. We have made several arrests and also detained some suspects who had started the clash,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said.Police have so far arrested 84 accused in the case. They were produced in court which sent them to judicial custody."

Sharma was assisting the crime branch in investigating the post-Godhra riots cases and as part of the probe, he obtained call detail records from mobile service providers AT&T and Celforce.Sharma stated, “For some reason, the data in the aforesaid CDs were not analysed by crime branch, Ahmedabad city. The existence of the CDs was lost sight of. The question that arises is how did the fact of the existence of the CDs come to the knowledge of the world at large, including the investigating officers of crime branch?”Sharma gave information about the CDs to the Nanavati Commission in 2004. “Had I not disclosed information about the existence of the CDs, this crucial data would have escaped the attention of theNanavati-Shah Commissionas well as the investigating agency,” Sharma stated.Sharma cited an order passed by theCentral Administrative Tribunal(CAT), quashing a departmental chargesheet that accused him of destroying vital evidence in the riots cases, to argue that he cannot be prosecuted for information revealed during his deposition before the inquiry commission.Sharma also stated that there was no government sanction to prosecute him under section 197 of the CrPC, because he was a police officer then. He also claimed that no question has been raised about the authenticity of the data before the court, not even by the accused. TheFSLhas verified the authenticity of the data.Sharma also argued that there is no evidence that he destroyed evidence. He reiterated aspects of his earlier depositions that the CDs, after he copied the data on to his personal computer, were sent back to crime branch JCP P P Pandey, who later denied having received them. Sharma contended that in the absence of evidence of their destruction, it could at the most be said that the CDs were misplaced.Further proceedings in the trial will take place next week.

In this one, the canvas is bigger and so are the characters. There are more artistes and it’s a lot more fun and a very honestfilm,” says Preetham.Prod him about the characters and the set of the film, and Preetham says, “For both films, huge sets were erected. In this film, there is an entire colony, which is colourful and has streets named after religions. There are characters who have come into the colony now. Sadhu Kokila returns as the doctor and Thithi fame Channegowda has done a special role.” Talking about Vijay’s character, he says, “People will get to see five different getups of Vijay and Rangayana Raghu. In the previous film, there was just one character for Rangayana Raghu. So, in that way the package is bigger. One of Vijay’s looks — the Lord Ram avatar — has already been revealed. There is a commando look as well. The other three looks audiences should watch onscreen in that particular scenario, because it is a situational comedy. But the highlight of the film is Vijay’s fantastic comic timing, which people have not seen before.”What will the audience take back from the film? “It’s a sweet film that depicts the reality of life without getting preachy. All of this is done with a lot of humour.” Preetham says that there are two chemistries in the film to watch out for. “The first one is between Vijay and Rachitha Ram, and the other is between Vijay and Rangayana Raghu, which is equivalent to any lead pair chemistry. In this film, you will see their bromance blossom even more,” Preetham says. On his part, Vijay is excited about reuniting with his ‘pal’ Preetham, as well as producing this sequel, which the duo is looking at making into a franchise. “Johnny Johnny Yes Papa is a very funny movie with a subtle message for society that everyone can enjoy,” says Vijay."

Kumar was acquitted in the case by the trial court.The letter and the CDs were placed before the bench during the hearing of the CBI's appeal against Kumar's acquittal in the murder of five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar area.It, however, separated the DSGMC letter and CDs and turned it into a PIL on which it issued notice to the CBI and the Congress leader and sought their responses before the next date of hearing, April 12.Kumar’s lawyer opposed the notice and the complaint and said they should be given the same. He also questioned its maintainability.The bench, however, said that all the parties should reply to it and the court will accordingly decide at an appropriate stage, whether the letter and CDs would be treated as an evidence in the appeals pending consideration before it. It also said that a copy of the letter and CDs would be provided to all the parties in the PIL.The trial court had awarded life term in May 2013 to Khokhar, Bhagmal and Girdhari Lal and three-year jail term to two others -former MLA Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. The convicts have challenged their conviction and jails terms awarded by the trial court.The CBI too has filed an appeal seeking enhancement of sentence of the convicts and the acquittal of Kumar, alleging that all of them were engaged in “a planned communal riot” and “religious cleansing”.The high court had on March 29 last year issued show cause notice to 11 accused, including Khokhar and Yadav, in five other 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases in which they had been acquitted by the trial court.The accused, who were acquitted of the charges, were asked why should the court not order reinvestigation and retrial against them as they faced allegations of “horrifying crimes against humanity”.The bench had issued notice on the complaints filed regarding the violent incidents on November 1 and 2, 1984 in Delhi Cantonment area.

Senior BJP leaders, including Saharanpur MPRaghav Lakhanpaland former MLA Rajeev Gumber, were booked for inciting crowds. Gumber told TOI that he recently met deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and gave him a letter which has now been forwarded to the law ministry for examination.“Those were all political cases and need to go now. Fake charges were slapped in a case which was politically motivated. And this was primarily because the administration was still working under the influence of the previous government as the BJP regime was too new and was establishing itself. I met deputy CM Keshav Maurya and I have been apprised of the fact that he has passed on that letter to the law ministry,” Gumber told TOI.Clashes had broken out between the two communities at Sadak Doodhli village over a procession onAmbedkar Jayantion April 20 last year. A number of shops were targeted while a few vehicles were also burnt as the violence escalated.Lakhanpal had allegedly led the march and instigated the crowd to force its way into the village despite the fact that no permission was sought for the procession. This led to stone-pelting, after which police initiated a crackdown.According to the FIR, those in the procession allegedly led by the MP and other leaders later reached the then SSP Love Kumar's official residence and vandalized it.An FIR was filed against 24 youths from both the communities as well as Lakhanpal and Gumber. Besides, 300 unidentified rioters were booked.Another 11 persons were booked under IPC’s sections 147 (guilty of rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) for attack on the SSP’s residence.The incident later triggered other clashes in the district, including one in Shabbirpur village between Thakur and Dalits and clashes in Saharanpur city between policemen and Dalits on May 9, in which Bhim Army chiefChandrashekhar Azadwas booked."

Out of these, 13 cases are of murder and 11 attempt to murder while 85 are mischief by fire or explosive with intent to destroy house.Senior Allahabad high court lawyer Sayyad Farhan Naqvi told TOI, “Let’s be very clear that the government has no authority to withdraw a case which is sub judice. However, section 321 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) empowers public prosecutor appointed by the government in a particular case to petition the court to quash a case on reasonable grounds. But, again, it is the prerogative of the court to accept or discard that demand.”Replying to a question, state’s law minister Brijesh Pathak had said on Thursday, “Chief minister Yogi Adidyanath has decided to withdraw those cases which were filed due to political reasons. We have initiated a process in this regard.""Manish Gandhi, a criminal lawyer in Delhi high court, said, “I do not think even section 321 of CrPC will come to the rescue of UP government in this matter. More than 50 people died in the riots and heinous crimes are involved.”Supreme Courtlawyer Vrinda Grover said, “What is implicit in the grant of power envisaged in section 321 of CrPC is that it should be in the interest of administration of justice. This is the guiding principle. Now, in this particular case ofMuzaffarnagarriots, the state’s decision of withdrawing the cases is not in the interest of administration of justice because the state is duty-bound to protect the right to life with dignity... the court will have the final say in upholding the interest of administration of justice.""Chandraveer Singh, a Muzaffarnagar-based lawyer who handled various riots cases, said, “Once chargesheet has been filed in a case, the trial begins in the court. The government then has no authority to undermine the power of judiciary.”In a very strong observation in a similar situation during the Akhilesh Yadav regime when the latter tried to seek withdrawal of a case in 2015, a three-judge bench of the Allahabad high court had said, “State government is not at all free to exercise its authority under Section 321 CrPC in whimsical or arbitrary manner or for extraneous considerations apart from just and valid reasons. Even if the government directs the public prosecutor to withdraw the prosecution and an application is filed to that effect, the court must consider all relevant circumstances and find out whether the withdrawal of prosecution would advance the cause of justice... Every crime is an offence against society and if the accused committed an offence, society demands that he should be punished.”During and after the 2013 riots, a total of 542 cases were lodged in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts. These included charges of murder, rape, arson, robbery and rioting. After investigation, 32 cases were found to be fake. Later, the SIT quashed another 170 cases. Of remaining 340 cases, police didn’t find any evidence against the accused named in 169 cases and submitted its final report (FR) in the court.In the remaining 172 cases, 18 are cases of murder and six of them include charges of rape. These 24 cases can’t be revoked. Of the 147 cases, the government has recommended revoking of three cases, in which BJP leaders Sanjeev Balyan, Suresh Rana, Sadhvi Parchi and others are accused.Of the remaining 144 cases, 13 have been decided in court and 131 are pending."

But Karnataka ran riot in the second half with goals fromVignesh Gunashekar(54th), Rajesh S (61st), Leon Augustine (89th) and an own goal byMathew Gonsalves(69th).After a cautious start by both teams, Goa showed intent in the 11th minute whenVictorino Fernandesmade an excellent run though the left, but his powerful shot went past the far post.Goa wasted a couple of opportunities before taking the lead. A Jessel Carneiro cross from the left found Kapil, whose diving header gave Karnataka goalkeeper Shainkhan CP no chance.Goa came calling again as Beevan D'Mello weaved past two Karnataka players and fed Kapil, whose shot was blocked by Shainkhan.The roles reversed in the second half, with Karnataka coming out all guns blazing. Striker Liton Shil shot wide from striking distance in the 47th minute. The equaliser came seven minutes later, thanks to a howler from Goa custodianAgnelo Gomes, who let Vignesh's shot slip through his legs.A brilliant solo by Rajesh, just past the hour mark, gave Karnataka the lead. Having dropped back to defend, the striker sprinted into the Goa half and let fly a power-packed shot from outside the box, which beat a diving Gomes.Karnataka piled more misery on Goa when Rajesh showed great skills to win the ball outside the rival box and sent in a dangerous ball which Gonsalves diverted into his own goal while trying to clear.Goa got a chance to pull one back in the 75th minute when a well-placed Victorino missed the target.Karnataka sealed the game in the closing minutes when Leon darted down the right, cut into the box and beat Gomes with a fine placement.Karnataka next face Odisha at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Saturday while Goa have a break before confronting Odisha at the Mohun Bagan ground on Monday."

Even as the riot unfolded half a kilometre away, New Kamptee police station personnel were busy downplaying repeated calls and complaints by the victim’s family that they were being attacked.Two groups were at loggerheads over a love marriage at Anand Nagar in Ramgadh locality late on Monday evening. The subsequent riot by more than two dozen goons claimed the life of 42-year-old Iqbal Sheikh and left his senior citizen parents, Zarina Bi and her husband Shaikh Jameel, seriously injured.The tension was triggered after Iqbal’s nephew SayyedIrfanand a 19-year-old young woman of the same community eloped, and got married knot on March 13. The girl’s family refused to accept the marriage. A police officer is learnt to have tried to settle the matter amicably, without filing a complaint at the police station, following the intervention of a social worker. However, the matter could not be resolved, and was left simmering.The dispute escalated after Irfan’s wife was forcibly taken away by her family four days ago. The young woman’s uncle,Jabbar Rehmu Khan, earlier booked for peddling narcotics, had been threatening Irfan, who was trying to convince his wife’s family to let her return to him.Jabbaris learnt to have masterminded the series of attacks on Monday night on Iqbal’s family, where Irfan had taken shelter along with his parents and siblings anticipating an attack at their own residence.Before the fatal attack, the families had locked horns, and the Shaikh family had been at the receiving end. Iqbal, his father Jameel, and two other family members had been injured. An injured Jameel and others went to New Kamptee police station, while Iqbal and others had stayed back at home. Some of their rivals too landed up at the police station to report their side of the story.As the cops were busy recording the statements of both sides, and also took a profusely bleeding Jameel to hospital, Jabbar and others stormed Iqbal’s residence with more armed accomplices for the second attack.Iqbal’s relatives at the police station got the news on the phone, and started pleading with the cops to rush to their residence to control the armed rivals who were pelting stones, and threatening them with swords and other weapons. However, the cops took the complaints lightly, and only reached the spot after the raiding gang had stabbed Iqbal to death, and seriously injured his mother, as the cornered family tried to stave off the attack.Irfan said Iqbal’s helpless family members kept on seeking police help through their relatives at the police station, but the cops did not react promptly. “We even made the cops hear the commotion and cries from our relatives as Jabbar and others attacked them. But the cops seemed to be in no hurry,” said a grieving Irfan.Irfan’s mother Zarina Bi said no cops turned up when the attack was underway. “Police did nothing to save our son. After his death, they have stationed commandos and cops in such large numbers,” she lamented.Senior PILalit Vartikarof New Kamptee police station admitted there was a delay in reaction, but that it was due to manpower shortage. “We have included names of 22 persons in the FIR along with some more accomplices. Nine, including Jabbar, have already been arrested,” he said. “We have already deployed Riot Control Police (RCP) and staffers from different police stations as a precautionary measure, to ensure there is no backlash,” he said."

Arijit had unsuccessfully contested the assembly election from Bhagalpur as aBJPcandidate in 2015.Several shops were vandalised and a two-wheeler was torched during the clashes. At least four policemen were injured in the heavy brickbatting between the two warring groups. The administration has since snapped the internet services in the district to prevent rumour mongering.According to theFIR, Arijit led the procession taken out under the aegis of Bharatiya Navavarsh Jagran Samiti to celebrate the first day of Vikarm Samvat, the historical Hindu calendar. The clashes began when Medininagar locals objected to the stoppage of the procession, as part of which Hindu religious songs were being played, at Medininagar Chowk.Sources said the procession was taken out without any written permission from the district administration.Besides Arijit, those named in the FIR (no 176/18) lodged in the Nathnagar police station include Abhay Kumar Ghosh Sonu, Dev Kumar Pandey, Anup Lal Sah, Pranav Sah, Pramod Verma, Niranjan Singh, Sanjay Singh and Surendra Pathak apart from “400-500 unnamed” people. They have been booked under Sections 147, 148, 149, 188, 353, 153A and 295A of the IPC besides 3(d) of Loudspeaker Act, police said.The IPC Sections deal with rioting, unlawful assembly, using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty, spreading disharmony and indulging in deliberate and malicious acts to outrage religious feelings.The second FIR (no 177/18) has been lodged in the same Nathnagar police station against Bikram Yadav, Pinta Yadav, Manish Yadav, Pankaj Yadav, Shankar Yadav, Mohd Shami Ansari, Mohd Sonu, Mohd Munna, Mohd Jasmin, Taha Alam and 500 unknown people.
