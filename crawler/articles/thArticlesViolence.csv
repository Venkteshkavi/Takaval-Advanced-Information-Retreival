The Congress party's idea of India is rooted in inclusion: Sam Pitroda,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/the-congress-partys-idea-of-india-is-rooted-in-inclusion-sam-pitroda/article26645890.ece,"
In India today, democracy, freedom and development have been compromised, says telecom guru and policy-maker
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"After the political row last week over his comments on the air strikes on Balakot in Pakistan, telecom pioneer, entrepreneur and Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda reiterated that he was not disrespectful to anybody and stressed that the 2019 polls are one of the most critical elections in modern history of India.Your comments questioning the Balakot strikes and stating that ‘entire Pakistan cannot be blamed for the Mumbai terror attacks’ have been attacked by the Prime Minister himself...First of all, everything that had to be said on this has been said and it is there in public domain. There isn't much to add. I was also flabbergasted that the Prime Minister, head of the party (BJP), cabinet ministers had to respond. I come from a Gandhian background. I felt in a democracy, it is my right to question. It doesn't mean disrespect to anybody.But I would request the Prime Minister to watch the entire tape. And tell me if there is anything in that tape which is disrespectful of anybody. If there is anything disrespectful, I will say sorry but I don’t think there is.The Congress called it 'an individual's comment' and distanced itself from your remarks.In the interview, I had made it clear that it is my view. It is Sam Pitroda's view and I stick to that. The party understood it. I don't think the party has anything to do with it. I am talking from a human perspective.But the Congress seems defensive when it comes to national security issues.I am not a security guy but you will have to wait for the Congress security policy which will probably be there in the manifesto.The BJP has always boasted of a muscular approach and attacked the Congress for a soft approach.Look, at the end of the day, the Congress party is the party of Mahatma Gandhi. This is again a personal view but the Congress party's idea of India is rooted in inclusion, respect for everyone. And that idea is embedded in democracy, freedom, human rights and equality. It is also rooted in Gandhian ideas of non-violence.How important are these elections for you to defend this Congress idea of India?Congress president Rahul Gandhi has time and again said that this election is one of the most critical elections in modern history of India. It is about the Soul of India. What is being challenged bothers us. When I look at India of today, I find that democracy has been compromised, freedom has been compromised, development has been compromised. We have not created enough jobs for our people. We have not created enough opportunities for our people.Then, there is farmer distress, demonetisation impact, GST (goods and services tax). Ultimately, we will have to look at the governance structure which facilitates entrepreneurship and job creation.So what are the main issues for the Congress in these elections?To me, the main issue is the soul of India. It's a complex idea and implies inclusion, freedom, diversity, democracy, equality, human rights, respect for women. From there, what flows is opportunities and jobs. There is farmer distress, demonetisation impact, GST [goods and services tax]. Ultimately, we will have to look at the governance structure which facilitate entrepreneurship and job creation.You say this is the most critical elections yet the Opposition has failed to come together.We have had conversations for quite some time and have alliances in Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Jharkhand Maharashtra but the real thing people were looking for was in Uttar Pradesh. It has not happened because negotiations have to be fair. Take it or leave it, my way or highway approach doesn't work.So, how will these parties [from UP] post elections come together with the Congress?Ultimately, everybody who believes in a broader idea of India, who believes in inclusion, will have to align. It will be nice if they can align before but it's okay if they do afterwards.Now, one of the arguments that is made out in favour of BJP is that a stable government under Mr .Modi gives more confidence to the international community and global investor than a motley combination of leaders and parties.How do you respond to that?I think it is exactly the opposite. You don't build a nation for investors. You build a nation for people living there. You don't want to discard you discussion and dialogue just because foreign investors are encouraged to invest. Of course, it is important but what cost. I think we could run a coalition government effectively under Dr. Manmohan Singh with a little bit of give and take. I would rather have that than have a strong dictatorial view of how to run things.Let me give you an example. We went to Moscow during President Gorbachev's time where a senior minister said they are very impressed with India. He said Mr. Pitroda we are very impressed because India can hold the country together without guns. But the day we turn the guns around, Soviet Union will fall apart.Regional leaders don't consider Rahul Gandhi should head the Opposition camp and each one has Prime Ministerial ambition!We have a Parliamentary system. We don't have a presidential system and Indian elections are not about Modi versus Gandhi. Whoever wins the highest number of seats will get to decide. So where is the problem? Rahul does not see this as a problem.You have been associated with the making of the manifesto. Apart from minimum income guarantee or NYAY, what else can we expect?Manifesto is an exercise in consolidating in people's aspiration. We have gone out to public and held series of consultations in India, abroad, townhall and conferences and thereafter have up with a list of things that can be summarised into 20-25 big ideas. What we will do with regard to jobs, health, education, women. And then there will be a preamble by the Congress president on his vision, where we are today and where we want to go tomorrow. Ultimately, we need to convince people that where we are today is not comfortable.How has Rahul Gandhi changed as Congress president now from the time he started in politics?Rahul Gandhi has learned a lot, much more mature. People don't give him credit for one thing which I really admire in a man. He has been beaten up by this massive machine called BJP, ridiculed, attacked in a very wrong way but this young man has been able to take in all this criticism year after year. And he is still rising. If he scratches, they will ask why is he scratching. If he is running, they will ask why is her running. If he winks, why is winking.If I was there in his place, I would have collapsed. He has inner strength to rise against all this humiliation, personal attacks, calling names. If Rahul Gandhi is Pappu, then I would like every young Indian guy to be like him.But critics say why should someone from the Gandhi family always be the Congress leader? There are many other talented leaders, they argue.The Gandhi family is the glue for the Congress party. It is not a talent contest or an examination of how many marks you got. It is about holding things together. I may be talented but I cannot do what Rahul Gandhi does in my lifetime. And that is holding things together.Now, his sister, Priyanka, has formally joined the party and she is seen to be more charismatic than him.I think she augments Rahul’s efforts. The skill sets that she has are a little different. They complement each other and they have been close friends while growing up because they only had each other. Priyanka is a good sounding board for Rahul."
Ajit Singh campaigns to ‘bury’ BJP in Muzaffarnagar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ajit-singh-campaigns-to-bury-bjp-in-muzaffarnagar/article26647648.ece,"
RLD leader banking on social arithmetic of Jatav-Jat-Muslim in riot-hit constituency, but faces an uphill task
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“Do you recognise me? I fought nine parliamentary elections, with both wins and losses. But why have I come to Muzaffarnagar to contest election, you tell me?”The question is directed at an audience of men and boys gathered around a Ravidas temple, a place of worship for Dalits, in Ladwa, a village in western Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district.There are Dalits, Muslims, Jats, and OBC communities like Kashyaps/Dheevar in the audience, most of whom are seated on neatly arranged red plastic chairs or standing in clusters.Their eyes are locked at the makeshift stage, dressed in banners of three parties — Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal — where a bespectacled man wearing a white kurta-pyjama is standing holding the microphone.“I have come to Muzaffarnagar because you are responsible for bringing the BJP to power. You fought with each other and destroyed thebhaichara[brotherhood]. As a result of that you have to bear Modi today,” he says.New challengeNow 80, RLD chief Ajit Singh has had many ups and downs in his political career, but facing a steep downward curve since 2013, perhaps the stakes have never been higher for his party as they are in the 2019 election.Moving out from his traditional seat of Baghpat, Mr. Singh has played a gamble by deciding to contest from Muzaffarnagar, a constituency which was marred by communal violence in 2013, triggering a communal polarisation which eventually helped the BJP sweep the State.While he has an uphill task to overturn the deficit from 2014, when the BJP’s Sanjeev Balyan secured a massive 6.53 lakh votes (58.98%), his fight is bolstered by the support of the SP and the BSP. Mr. Singh is going from village to village addressing nukkad sabhas to connect with his new electorate in the sugar belt.“You want to bear Modi for five more years,” he asks the crowd at Ladwa. Some of them reply: “No, not any more.” Mr. Singh then says: “Maintain your bhaichara, and Modi will disappear. You did that in Kairana, didn’t the BJP lose?”The 2013 communal violence demolished the RLD’s carefully stitched decades old Jat-Muslim coalition. The results were clear in 2014; Mr. Singh himself stood a humiliating third from his bastion Baghpat.The Hindufollowed Mr. Singh through his nukkad sabhas and found most of his attacks targeted at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, backed by his desire to restore the RLD’s lost social coalition. “Just defeating Modi won’t do. You will have to bury him. You will have to uproot him,” he tells the crowd, his fist smacking the air passionately.The audience bursts into claps and shouts of “Chaudhary Ajit Singh zindabad” resonating in the open venue. “Modi, yourachhe dinare gone, ourachhe dinare coming,” he declares.The Jat leader also uses witty one-liners to mock Mr. Modi on his persona and track-record, evoking laughter from the rural audience. “Bhaiya, if he [Mr. Modi] goes to Sri Lanka, he would return and say, I killed Ravan.”Another one-liner which generates a louder response from the audience is: “People say Modi lies a lot. He doesn’t lie, he just never speaks the truth.”Local supportAfter the sabha is over, Mr. Singh moves into his SUV and is quickly escorted away to a local supporter’s house where fruits have been laid out for his welcome. Saying no to hospitality is not an option in this part of western Uttar Pradesh, even though Mr. Singh is an hour behind schedule.After a quick interval, the cavalcade drives past sugarcane and wheat fields and reaches the house of a prominent RLD old-timer, a farmer, to pacify him. To secure his win, Mr. Singh would require to revive support of all such disgruntled loyalists and the farmer, despite not being in the best of health, is convinced to address a nukkad sabha for Mr. Singh at the next location, Titavi. Along the way, drum beats, shower of flowers and handshakes welcome the Jat veteran.At Titavi, Mr. Singh once again presses for communal unity among his core constituencies. He also explains to people the economic downfall caused by the riots and how the local steel rod factories are still shut. “I want to bring Muzaffarnagar back to the same position where it was before the riots,” he says.With the SP and BSP in alliance with the RLD, Mr. Singh has ensured consolidation of the Jatavs and Muslims, with the latter itself making up for 41% of the district population. That the combined vote of the SP, BSP and RLD in each of the five Assembly segments of Muzaffarnagar in 2017 polls had crossed 50% also presents a hope for him.However, to ensure a victory and galvanise his party, he faces the challenge of reviving his appeal among the Jats, a section of whom are still inclined towards Mr. Modi and Mr. Balyan, who himself is a local Jat.To woo them, Mr. Singh focuses on issue of cane dues, menace of stray cattle and joblessness, and accuses the BJP of trying to divide the country in the name of the Army, which also recruits from the Jat community.Farmers’ woesThe RLD chief strikes a chord with Virendra Singh, a Jat farmer listening patiently in the crowd. Virendra complains that the rate of milk and cattle have fallen under the BJP rule. Another Jat, Rajendra Singh, hits out at Mr. Modi over the unemployment issue, while farmer Soraj Singh, a traditional RLD voter, regrets voting for the BJP in 2014 due to the riots. “All they did was increase the power tariff. Even if the BJP fields a Jat, we will vote for Chaudhary ji. We won’t just vote, we will make him win,” says Soraj.Raj Kumar, a Jatav, also speaks against the BJP. “We are fed up of BJP. I lost ₹80,000 during demonetisation.”A few kilometres away in Kutba village, the opinion is, however, split, with many Jats still supporting Mr. Modi and happy to see the back of the previous Muslim MPs from Muzaffarnagar. Current MP Sanjeev Balyan hails from Kutba, which along with its adjoining village Kutbi, witnessed eight deaths during the 2013 violence.While young Akshay Kumar praises the sitting MP for building metalled roads, widening the canal track and setting up solar panels, Randheer Singh, a farmer, is happy with the ₹2,000 he received under the PM KISAN scheme. They also praise the Balakot air strikes, with one local comparing Mr. Modi to a patriotic king.As the conversation shifts to the battle between the RLD and the BJP and economic issues, divisions emerge, a sharp contrast from 2013 when Jats rallied heavily behind the BJP amid communal polarisation.Pushpendra Kumar, a farmer, praises the air strike, but is tilted towards the RLD and regrets voting for the BJP in 2014. He is aggrieved by stray cows which are eating his wheat crop and forcing him to spend money on fencing his 23-bigha field. “Ajit Singh is more sympathetic towards the farmers,” says Pushpendra, blaming Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for “letting loose the cows.Parveen Balyan, who works at a local sugar mill, compares the alliance partners to “thieves” ganging up against Mr. Modi. He also questions Mr. Singh for choosing Muzaffarnagar instead of Baghpat. “For 20 years he was a Minister and an MP but what work did he do?” asks Parveen. But he believes that Mr. Singh will give a tough fight this time, and predicts a low victory margin of 20,000 votes for the BJP.Like a section of Jats, OBC groups like Kashyaps, Dheevars and Julahas, and upper castes are also tilted towards the BJP. “We don’t care about the candidate, we want BJP,” says Sonu, a Julaha, in Dhindhawali village. His namesake, Sonu, a Rohilla Rajput, admits Mr. Singh has the arithmetic to back up a strong fight but still expects the BJP to win. “All I want is a strong government, a BJP government,” he says."

She also translated many famous works.During an interview with a Malayalam magazine recently she revealed the opposition and even brutal punishment she had to undergo from her dear ones to pursue her writings.Condoling her death, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote on Facebook that “Ashitha used her stories for creating gender equality.

Union Minister inaugurates NDA election convention ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The culture of political violence that is being allegedly propagated by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government will adversely affect its prospects in the coming Lok Sabha polls, Union Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said.The senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader was in the State capital on Tuesday to inaugurate the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) convention of Thiruvananthapuram constituency candidate Kummanam Rajasekharan.Alleging that a chaotic situation prevailed in the State, she accused the CPI(M) of unleashing its cadres to operate along with the police to eliminate or frame BJP and the RSS.“Instances of dreadful violence against the BJP and the RSS workers continue unabated in the State. However, despite accusing the BJP of being responsible for the attacks, the government has desisted from conducting comprehensive probes. This clearly proves their fear of being exposed for orchestrating such violence. Violence of such order cannot be seen anywhere else in the country,” she said.Rebutting the Opposition claims that the Narendra Modi government has failed to generate employment, Ms. Sitharaman said the debate failed to consider the jobs generated in the unorganised sector.Unorganised sector“The data being collected by government agencies include only those on workers in the organised sector. However, massive employment has been generated by small and medium-sized businesses that have formed around the infrastructure developed by the Modi government,” she said.She also accused the Congress of manufacturing fictitious and fake documents to raise false allegations against the BJP. “It is a sign of their desperation. Such actions will not have an impact in the polls. Let them instead focus on retaining their 44 seats (in the Lok Sabha),” she quipped.Inaugurating the convention, Ms. Sitharaman said the NDA government had inherited a country that suffered through irresponsible governance at the hands of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). “The country is currently the third fastest growing economy in the world. We cannot afford to lose the momentum. To ensure this, the Modi government has implemented major reforms, some even unpopular, to ensure that the bureaucratic system worked in tandem with the government,” Ms. Sitharaman said.BJP leaders Kummanan Rajasekharan, O. Rajagopal, MLA, national executive member P.K. Krishnadas, district president S. Suresh, former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman G. Madhavan Nair, former diplomat T.P. Sreenivasan, former bureaucrat C.V. Ananda Bose, and former State Police Chief T.P. Sreenivasan were among those present."

Says it had to rescind three election notifications in the recent past ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday told the Madras High Court that till 2009, violence was a major issue during polls in Tamil Nadu. However, things worsened since then, with cash-for-votes permeating the electoral field.The commission had to rescind as many as three election notifications in the State in the recent past due to complaints of large-scale corruption.Opposing a public interest litigation petition before Justices S. Manikumar and Subramonium Prasad, ECI counsel Niranjan Rajagopalan said the commission had been doing its best to keep a check on corrupt practices by forming flying squads and election expenditure monitoring teams. Voters were also administered a pledge against cash-for-votes under the Systemic Voters’ Education and Electoral Pariticpation (SVEEP) programme, he said.When the judges opined that anti-corruption programmes should be conducted on a continuous basis and not just during elections, the counsel said the Election Commission did not have its own manpower. It was dependent on officials belonging to the Revenue, Income Tax and Police departments and the commission loses its hold over them immediately after the elections.One of the many prayers of the PIL petitioner, K.K. Ramesh of Madurai, was to recover from the candidate concerned or the head of the political party to which he/she belongs, all expenses incurred by the government for conducting elections that get cancelled due to bribing of voters. Stating that it may not be possible to issue such a blanket direction, the judges dismissed the PIL petition in so far as that prayer was concerned.Measures takenOn other relief sought by the PIL petitioner, the judges recorded Mr. Rajagopalan’s submission that the court had already imposed a ban on installation of flex boards and unauthorised flag posts. Similarly, the government had banned use of plastic flags and prohibited transportation of passengers in goods vehicles. All these regulations would be strictly enforced and violators would be prosecuted, he said.It was brought to notice that the Solid and Plastic Waste Management Rules of 2016 would have to be followed by all parties when it came to disposal of campaign material. The counsel said instructions had already been issued to political parties in the interest of protecting the environment.“When the model code of conduct is in force, all existing laws on varied subjects will be enforced as usual through the agencies concerned. It is only on matters, such as electoral expenditure, which were not governed by any law that the Election Commission issues suitable instructions by invoking its powers under Article 324 of the Constitution,” he added."
Plea for woman CBI official to probe Pollachi sexual abuse case,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/plea-for-woman-cbi-official-to-probe-pollachi-case/article26647387.ece,"
Six women lawyers seek setting up of one-stop crisis centres for providing assistance to victims ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Madras High Court on Tuesday decided to hear on Friday a public interest litigation petition filed jointly by six women lawyers seeking a direction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to appoint a high-ranking woman official to probe thePollachi sexual abuse caseswhich were transferred to it by the State government.First Division Bench of Chief Justice Vijaya Kamlesh Tahilramani and Justice M. Duraiswamy agreed to take up the case for admission on Friday, after senior counsel R. Vaigai, representing the petitioners, requested for early hearing of the case since they had also sought for extension of benefits of witness protection scheme to the victims.Secondary victimisationAnother relief sought by the petitioners was to issue a direction to the State government and Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority to set up one-stop crisis centres along with victim-centric standard operative procedures and survivor support services for providing medical care, legal aid and other assistance to victims of sexual crimes.G. Chamki Raj, A. Arulmozhi, B.S. Ajeetha, Adhilakshmi Logamurthy, R. Sudha and Kiruba Munusamy had filed the case.The petitioners accused the State government of having created a hostile environment for the victims, their families and other victims in the Pollachi sexual abuse issue.The petitioners said the government had thereby caused “secondary victimisation of victims of sexual violence.”The petitioners claimed that no survivor support structures or witness protection scheme was in place in the State. “No information has been provided to the public about this. Hence, we have approached this honourable court to voice the concerns of the victims as in the circumstances of the case and the very nature of things, they are unable to speak out,” the petitioners said.Lack of protectionAccusing the police and the State government of having revealed the identity of the complainant in the case in violation of the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court, the women lawyers said the lack of protection to the complainant as well as other victims had become a significant barrier in their pursuit for justice.“The most important safeguard to a victim of sexual violence is the protection of identity,” they said.“This protection has been totally disregarded in the instant case. It is obvious that the rest of the victims of sexual assault and blackmail have not come forward to give any complaint to the police,” the petitioners added.In order to ensure a free and fair investigation into the issue, they insisted that a gender-sensitive woman officer be appointed by the CBI to investigate the Pollachi issue."

The folk-rock music band is known for their powerful stand and songs against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and human rights violations in Manipur.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“It’s really hot here,” says Akhu Chingangbam, as we catch up with him on a sultry March afternoon in Fort Kochi. And then he says, “Back home, it’s beautiful right now”. Home is Imphal, where Akhu’s roots, heart and inspiration are, and where he keeps going back to through the length of our conversation.Akhu is the founder-songwriter-frontman of the folk-rock music band, Imphal Talkies and the Howlers, known for their powerful stand and songs against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and human rights violations in Manipur. There is also, in Akhu’s songs written both in his native Meiteilon and English, a fierce assertion of the Manipuri identity and a vehement resistance against efforts to annihilate their indigenous culture.The lyrics of Stand United Against CAB, their latest song released on YouTube is unambivalent in its criticism of the Citizenship Amendment Bill. The song, says Akhu, came from his many sleepless nights, and it was put together without a plan. “Anyone who listens to it will know that it is a spontaneous song.”An outsiderGrowing up in Manipur, violence was an everyday aspect of Akhu’s life. He would attend school, then go out to protest in the streets, the routine of most school-going children and what they deemed was normal. And like most Manipuris, he watched Bollywood movies and listened to Hindi songs, and believed he was as Indian as anyone else in the country. But Delhi, to where he moved to pursue higher studies, brought him the realisation that violence could not be the norm, and that he was an outsider. “I realised I was not one of them, and that was eye-opening.”He took to singing in Delhi streets, at protest venues and found that music had the power to express his deep-rooted angst and anger. Akhu sings, “Is there a dream that we share from east to west?/Is there a song that echoes from north to south?”But a lot has changed since 2008 when he formed the band and recorded the first album, says the musician. “I am not as angry as I was.” The credit he gives to the children he worked with as part of his project, A Native Tongue Called Peace. Since 2015, Akhu has been teaching music to the residents of a children’s home in Imphal. While making music with them, he is careful not to let politics seep in, for, he doesn’t “want to be yet another guy who runs an organisation to spread propaganda”. The project produced five original songs and has been a healing experience for children who came from broken backgrounds. Music uplifted their spirits and gave them confidence; for Akhu, it brought hope.Hope came to him again last year, when the India Foundation for the Arts granted him a 14-month fellowship, with which he toured parts of Assam and Bangladesh to meet Manipuris living there. While the radical Manipuri poetry of the 1960s and 70s has inspired him, he had grown weary of going back to the same stories time and again. He wanted to look beyond the geographical boundaries and hear stories of his people who had fled Manipur in the 19th Century and settled down in other regions. In his quest, he stumbled upon a treasure trove of stories – of people whose notions of Manipur were still romantic and filled with hope. Out of his travels was born the album, ‘Ema gi Wari’ (Stories of my mother), with seven songs, all connected to each other that they seem like a story.The Imphal Talkies gave the first public performance of their album at the Cabral Yard in Fort Kochi last weekend as part of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale. The band also performed at a show presented by Alt Wave in the city. The Biennale, says Akhu, has inspired him to go back to Manipur and organise the sixth edition of the music and arts festival, “Where have all the flowers gone”; commemorating American folk singer, Pete Seeger.There are days when the musician finds the going a tad difficult, especially after an accident last year left him deaf in his right ear. “Sometimes I think I am yet to come to terms with my loss. There are days when I wake up and try to imagine how it was when I had hearing in both my ears.” But nothing can stop him from making more music. When Akhu returns home, he has a lot of unfinished music to work on, and left unrecorded, he says, it haunts him. “I will make music till the end of time, or as long as I survive.”"

Manikumar and Subramonium Prasad, ECI counsel Niranjan Rajagopalan said the commission had been doing its best to keep a check on corrupt practices by forming flying squads and election expenditure monitoring teams. Voters were also administered a pledge against cash-for-votes under the Systemic Voters’ Education and Electoral Pariticpation (SVEEP) programme, he said.When the judges opined that anti-corruption programmes should be conducted on a continuous basis and not just during elections, the counsel said the Election Commission did not have its own manpower. It was dependent on officials belonging to the Revenue, Income Tax and Police departments and the commission loses its hold over them immediately after the elections.One of the many prayers of the PIL petitioner, K.K. Ramesh of Madurai, was to recover from the candidate concerned or the head of the political party to which he/she belongs, all expenses incurred by the government for conducting elections that get cancelled due to bribing of voters. Stating that it may not be possible to issue such a blanket direction, the judges dismissed the PIL petition in so far as that prayer was concerned.Measures takenOn other relief sought by the PIL petitioner, the judges recorded Mr. Rajagopalan’s submission that the court had already imposed a ban on installation of flex boards and unauthorised flag posts. Similarly, the government had banned use of plastic flags and prohibited transportation of passengers in goods vehicles. All these regulations would be strictly enforced and violators would be prosecuted, he said.It was brought to notice that the Solid and Plastic Waste Management Rules of 2016 would have to be followed by all parties when it came to disposal of campaign material. The counsel said instructions had already been issued to political parties in the interest of protecting the environment.“When the model code of conduct is in force, all existing laws on varied subjects will be enforced as usual through the agencies concerned. It is only on matters, such as electoral expenditure, which were not governed by any law that the Election Commission issues suitable instructions by invoking its powers under Article 324 of the Constitution,” he added."

RLD leader banking on social arithmetic of Jatav-Jat-Muslim in riot-hit district, but faces an uphill task
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“Do you recognise me? I fought nine parliamentary elections, with both wins and losses. But why have I come to Muzaffarnagar to contest election, you tell me?”The question is directed at an audience of men and boys gathered around a Ravidas temple, a place of worship for Dalits, in Ladwa, a village in western Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district.There are Dalits, Muslims, Jats, and OBC communities like Kashyaps/Dheevar in the audience, most of whom are seated on neatly arranged red plastic chairs or standing in clusters.Their eyes are locked at the makeshift stage, dressed in banners of three parties — Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal — where a bespectacled man wearing a white kurta-pyjama is standing holding the microphone.“I have come to Muzaffarnagar because you are responsible for bringing the BJP to power. You fought with each other and destroyed thebhaichara[brotherhood]. As a result of that you have to bear Modi today,” he says.New challengeNow 80, RLD chief Ajit Singh has had many ups and downs in his political career, but facing a steep downward curve since 2013, perhaps the stakes have never been higher for his party as they are in the 2019 election.Moving out from his traditional seat of Baghpat, Mr. Singh has played a gamble by deciding to contest from Muzaffarnagar, a constituency which was marred by communal violence in 2013, triggering a communal polarisation which eventually helped the BJP sweep the State.While he has an uphill task to overturn the deficit from 2014, when the BJP’s Sanjeev Balyan secured a massive 6.53 lakh votes (58.98%), his fight is bolstered by the support of the SP and the BSP. Mr. Singh is going from village to village addressing nukkad sabhas to connect with his new electorate in the sugar belt.“You want to bear Modi for five more years,” he asks the crowd at Ladwa. Some of them reply: “No, not any more.” Mr. Singh then says: “Maintain your bhaichara, and Modi will disappear. You did that in Kairana, didn’t the BJP lose?”The 2013 communal violence demolished the RLD’s carefully stitched decades old Jat-Muslim coalition. The results were clear in 2014; Mr. Singh himself stood a humiliating third from his bastion Baghpat.The Hindufollowed Mr. Singh through his nukkad sabhas and found most of his attacks targeted at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, backed by his desire to restore the RLD’s lost social coalition. “Just defeating Modi won’t do. You will have to bury him. You will have to uproot him,” he tells the crowd, his fist smacking the air passionately.The audience bursts into claps and shouts of “Chaudhary Ajit Singh zindabad” resonating in the open venue. “Modi, yourachhe dinare gone, ourachhe dinare coming,” he declares.Local supportAfter the sabha is over, Mr. Singh moves into his SUV and the cavalcade drives past sugarcane and wheat fields and reaches the house of a prominent RLD old-timer, a farmer, to pacify him. To secure his win, Mr. Singh would require to revive support of all such disgruntled loyalists and the farmer, despite not being in the best of health, is convinced to address a nukkad sabha for Mr. Singh at the next location, Titavi. Along the way, drum beats, shower of flowers and handshakes welcome the Jat veteran.At Titavi, explains to people the economic downfall caused by the riots and how the local steel rod factories are still shut. “I want to bring Muzaffarnagar back to the same position where it was before the riots,” he says.With the SP and BSP in alliance with the RLD, Mr. Singh has ensured consolidation of the Jatavs and Muslims, with the latter itself making up for 41% of the district population. That the combined vote of the SP, BSP and RLD in each of the five Assembly segments of Muzaffarnagar in 2017 polls had crossed 50% also presents a hope for him.However, to ensure a victory and galvanise his party, he faces the challenge of reviving his appeal among the Jats, a section of whom are still inclined towards Mr. Modi and Mr. Balyan, who himself is a local Jat.To woo them, Mr. Singh focuses on issue of cane dues, menace of stray cattle and joblessness, and accuses the BJP of trying to divide the country in the name of the Army, which also recruits from the Jat community.Farmers’ woesThe RLD chief strikes a chord with Virendra Singh, a Jat farmer listening patiently in the crowd. Virendra complains that the rate of milk and cattle have fallen under the BJP rule. Another Jat, Rajendra Singh, hits out at Mr. Modi over the unemployment issue, while farmer Soraj Singh, a traditional RLD voter, regrets voting for the BJP in 2014 due to the riots. “All they did was increase the power tariff. Even if the BJP fields a Jat, we will vote for Chaudhary ji,” says Soraj.Raj Kumar, a Jatav, also speaks against the BJP. “We are fed up of BJP. I lost Rs. 80,000 during demonetisation.”A few kilometres away in Kutba village, the opinion is, however, split, with many Jats still supporting Mr. Modi and happy to see the back of the previous Muslim MPs from Muzaffarnagar. Current MP Sanjeev Balyan hails from Kutba, which along with its adjoining village Kutbi, witnessed eight deaths during the 2013 violence.While young Akshay Kumar praises the sitting MP for building metalled roads, widening the canal track and setting up solar panels, Randheer Singh, a farmer, is happy with the Rs. 2,000 he received under the PM KISAN scheme. They also praise the Balakot air strikes, with one local comparing Mr. Modi to a patriotic king.Parveen Balyan, who works at a local sugar mill, compares the alliance partners to “thieves” ganging up against Mr. Modi. He also questions Mr. Singh for choosing Muzaffarnagar. “For 20 years he was a Minister and an MP but what work did he do?” asks Parveen.Like a section of Jats, OBC groups like Kashyaps, Dheevars and Julahas, and upper castes are also tilted towards the BJP. “We don’t care about the candidate, we want BJP,” says Sonu, a Julaha, in Dhindhawali. His namesake, Sonu, a Rohilla Rajput, admits Mr. Singh has the arithmetic to back up a strong fight but still expects the BJP to win. “All I want is a strong government, a BJP government,” he says."

In India today, democracy, freedom and development have been compromised, says telecom guru and policy-maker
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"After the political row last week over his comments on the air strikes on Balakot in Pakistan,Sam Pitroda, telecom innovator, entrepreneur and chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, said he was not disrespectful to anybody. He says this Lok Sabha election is one of the most critical elections in the modern history of India.Your comments questioning the Balakot strikes and stating that ‘entire Pakistan cannot be blamed for the Mumbai terror attacks’ have been attacked by the Prime Minister himself...First of all, everything that had to be said on this has been said and it is there in public domain. There isn’t much to add. I was also flabbergasted that the Prime Minister, head of the party (BJP), Cabinet Ministers had to respond. I come from a Gandhian background. I felt in a democracy, it is my right to question. It doesn’t mean disrespect to anybody.But I would request the Prime Minister to watch the entire tape. And tell me if there is anything in that tape which is disrespectful of anybody. If there is anything disrespectful, I will say sorry but I don’t think there is.The BJP has always boasted of a muscular approach and attacked the Congress for a soft approach.Look, at the end of the day, the Congress party is the party of Mahatma Gandhi. This is again a personal view but the Congress party’s idea of India is rooted in inclusion, respect for everyone. And that idea is embedded in democracy, freedom, human rights and equality. It is also rooted in Gandhian ideas of non-violence.How important are these elections for you to defend this Congress idea of India?Congress president Rahul Gandhi has time and again said that this election is one of the most critical elections in modern history of India. It is about the Soul of India. What is being challenged bothers us. When I look at India of today, I find that democracy has been compromised, freedom has been compromised, development has been compromised. We have not created enough jobs for our people. We have not created enough opportunities for our people.Then, there is farmer distress, demonetisation impact, GST (goods and services tax). Ultimately, we will have to look at the governance structure which facilitates entrepreneurship and job creation.You say this is the most critical election, but the Opposition has failed to come together?Ultimately, everybody who believes in a broader idea of India, who believes in inclusion, will have to align. It will be nice if they can align before but it’s okay if they do afterwards.But regional leaders don’t consider Rahul Gandhi as the leader of the Opposition camp and each one has prime ministerial ambitions!We don’t have a presidential system and Indian elections are not about Modi versus Gandhi. Whosoever wins the highest number of seats will get to decide.So where is the problem? Rahul does not see this as a problem.How has Rahul Gandhi changed as Congress president now from the time he started in politics?Rahul Gandhi has learned a lot, is much more mature. People don’t give him credit for one thing which I really admire in a man — he has been beaten up by this massive machine called the BJP, ridiculed, attacked in a very wrong way, but this young man has been able to take in all this criticism year after year. And he is still rising. He has inner strength to rise against all this humiliation, personal attacks, calling names.Now Priyanka, has formally joined the party and she is seen as more charismatic.I think she augments Rahul’s efforts. The skill sets that she has are a little different. They complement each other and they have been close friends while growing up because they only had each other. Priyanka is a good sounding board for Rahul.(Full interview onbit.ly/PitrodaInterview)I felt in a democracy, it is my right to question. It doesn't mean disrespect to anybody."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Gaza militants fired rockets into southern Israel and Israeli aircraft carried out strikes in the Hamas-ruled territory overnight Tuesday, though the level of violence appeared to abate after Palestinians said a ceasefire had been reached.After a day of intense cross-border fighting, Palestinian officials said Egypt had mediated a truce late on Monday. The respite didn't last long, however.Rocket sirens continued sounding in Israeli towns near the border, sending residents running for shelter. The military, which amassed extra troops and tanks along the border, said it struck a Hamas compound and outposts in response.There were no immediate reports of casualties.The latest round of violence began early Monday when seven Israelis were wounded near Tel Aviv when a house was destroyed by a rocket attack. Hours later Israel carried out a wave of retaliatory strikes, wounding five Palestinians.Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, and smaller Palestinian factions put out a late-night statement that Egypt had mediated a ceasefire. Israeli officials did not comment on whether a truce had been reached.Israel remained on high alert, with schools near the border kept closed and residents instructed to stay near bomb shelters.The military said in a statement it remained “prepared for various scenarios.”The escalation came just two weeks before an election in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his political life after a decade in power, campaigning on a tough line against Palestinian militants.Beset by corruption scandals, he faces a strong challenge from a centrist coalition led by a top general.Mr. Netanyahu cut short a visit to the United States, saying he would fly home right after meeting President Donald Trump.“Israel will not tolerate this. I will not tolerate this,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “And as we speak... Israel is responding forcefully to this wanton aggression.”Mr. Trump told reporters with Mr. Netanyahu at his side that Israel has the “absolute right” to defend itself.Dozens of explosions had rocked the Palestinian coastal enclave of Gaza on Monday and ambulance sirens echoed in the mostly empty streets. In one neighbourhood, people rushed to buy bread in anticipation of a long escalation. The office of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was one of the initial targets hit, although he was likely to have been evacuated in advance.Gaza militants fired barrages of rockets into Israel late into the night. Some were shot down by Israeli defenses and others landed in empty areas.Israel has waged three wars on Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. Israeli air strikes in retaliation for rockets from Gaza are a frequent occurrence, but Israel's swift mobilisation of extra troops to the border area was unusual.The two sides have managed to avert all-out war for five years, most recently with the help of Egyptian mediation after a major escalation in November last year."

Hate has curdled the capacity for compassion in India. Will Indians take a leaf out of New Zealand’s book? ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“We are broken-hearted, but we are not broken,” declared Imam Gamal Fouda, while leading Friday prayers in Christchurch in New Zealand one week after the terror attack. “We are alive, we are together, we are determined to not let anyone divide us.”In a moment of immense tragedy, the people of New Zealand have shown a world riven by bigotry and hatred whatsolidarity and love can accomplish, even in the darkest times. It is a lesson which Indians, more bitterly divided today than ever since the blood-drenched days of Partition, must heed. But will we?Display of solidarityTheazaanwas broadcast before the memorial service all across New Zealand. Outside the mosques where the terrorist had massacred the worshippers, and in mosques around the country, hundreds of men, women and children assembled in solidarity with the families of the dead. They locked their hands with each other, creating a wall around their Muslim brothers and sisters who prayed. Many of the women wore hijabs.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern attended the prayer meeting, her head covered by a black dupatta. After the prayers she quoted Prophet Mohammad. “According to Prophet Mohammad... the believers in their mutual kindness, compassion, and sympathy are just like one body. When any part of the body suffers, the whole body feels pain,” she said. “New Zealand mourns with you; we are one.”Also ReadChristchurch massacre: a wake-up callEarlier too, when Ms. Ardern visited the mourning families to comfort them, her head was covered by a black dupatta. As she embraced them, her face mirrored their pain, making plain to those who had lost their loved ones in the shootings that she shared their suffering.The contrast with India over the last five years could not have been more telling. There have been many brutal mob attacks against Muslims, videotaped and circulated widely on social media. These hate attacks — by individuals and mobs — have spread fear and anguish among Muslims across the land. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has never once visited the bereaved families and has never communicated his empathy in a public address or through social media. When Kashmiri students were being attacked in many parts of India after a suicide bomber killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel in Pulwama, Kashmir, Mr. Modi declared that the rage that burnt in the hearts of people burnt in his heart too. It was an unambiguous message encouraging revenge.While Muslims constitute 14% of India’s people, in New Zealand they are only over 1%. Ms. Ardern recognised that many of them could be migrants or refugees, but “they are us... The perpetrator is not”. The message that Mr. Modi communicates with his deafening silences is exactly the opposite. He is rooted in the ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which believes that the Muslim who has been part of this country for centuries is not one of “us”, but the perpetrator of violence is.Also ReadNo place in New Zealand for such attackers, says PM Jacinda ArdernIn the last several months, we have made 27 harrowing journeys of the Karwan-e-Mohabbat into 15 States of India. In each, we have gone to the homes of the families of those who have lost their loved ones to hate and violence. Each time we have learnt afresh how much our simple gesture of reaching out means to these distraught families. They feel alone and abandoned as they battle loss and the hate of their neighbours or strangers who attacked their loved ones. As we embrace and hold each other’s hands, our eyes turn moist as they weep. Often, families in distant parts say that we are the first people who reached out to them.It is this that Ms. Ardern did for the loved ones of those slaughtered while in prayer in Christchurch. I have often wished that this is what our Prime Minister and leaders of the Opposition who claim to stand for secular politics would do. But none of them has shown the spontaneous compassion or the political courage to reach out to these stricken victims forced to battle hate alone.Take also the symbolic question of headgear. Ms. Ardern covered her head with a dupatta to show respect to a stricken people, not necessarily as an endorsement of the practice. Inspired by the Prime Minister’s gesture, women all over New Zealand — newsreaders, policewomen, ordinary people — covered their heads with hijab scarves. Imam Fouda said to Ms. Ardern, “Thank you for holding our families close and honouring us with a simple scarf.” By contrast, Mr. Modi has worn every conceivable form of headgear in his travels across a diverse India, but he has pointedly refused only one, and this is the Muslim skull cap.Ms. Ardern also took firm steps to not allow the hate propaganda of the killer or the video he live-streamed to be circulated, and pledged never to utter his name publicly. By contrast, the videos that perpetrators of lynching and hate attacks shoot and upload in India are freely circulated. So are the hate speeches by them and indeed by many leading members of the ruling establishment. Those charged with hate killings are celebrated by Union Ministers, with garlands and the national flag.Also ReadDubai projects New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern image on Burj KhalifaReligious leaders of Christian and Jewish faiths in New Zealand, Australia and around the Western world have come out in iridescent solidarity with the Muslim community, and have attended joint prayers in mosques. Stu Cameron, Minister of Newlife Church on the Gold Coast, said, “Good neighbours always weep when the other is weeping, and stand together in solidarity when the other feels threatened.” Sikh gurudwaras in New Zealand opened up for the survivors’ families. In India, there have been no similar demonstrations of care by religious leaders after brutal hate attacks.Lack of compassionHowever, what is even more worrying than the failures of political and religious leaders in India to resist hate violence is the profound lack of compassion and solidarity in local communities wherever these attacks have occurred. There is no empathy with people who are so pushed into fear that they can no longer recognise this as a country to which they belong. Nowhere in our journeys of the Karwan have we heard reports of care and support for survivors of hate attacks by neighbours from other religions and castes. In upmarket Gurugram, mobs supported by the administration have succeeded in bullying Muslim worshippers to reduce the numbers of places where they can worship on Fridays to a tenth of the original number. It is nothing short of a civilisational crisis that we have allowed hate to curdle even our capacity for compassion.Imam Fouda in New Zealand said, “We are broken-hearted but not broken.” Our civilisation crisis is that as our brothers and sisters are being felled by hate around the country, we are not broken-hearted. We just don’t care. In fact, some of us endorse and celebrate the attacks. This is how broken we have become as a people.Harsh Mander is a human rights worker, writer and teacher"

Shutdown in Kashmir over JKLF ban,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shutdown-in-kashmir-over-jklf-ban/article26627636.ece,"
Former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti termed the Centre's decision ""ironical"". ",,"A shutdown was observed in Kashmir on Sunday against theCentre's ban on separatist JKLF, led by Yasin Malik.The strike call was issued by separatist amalgam, Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL), comprising Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Mr. Malik, who remains behind the bar.The shutdown impacted the life in the Valley. All markets, petrol pumps and private offices remain closed. Traffic on the roads was skeletal. Train services were also suspended as a precautionary measure.The ban on JKLF comes less than a month of the ban on the socio-religious party Jamaat-e-Islami.

The spokesman said such moves ""will neither break the resolve of people of Kashmir nor push the leadership into submission"".Former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti termed the Centre's decision ""ironical"". ""One one hand the Centre is claiming to have launched a rehabilitation scheme, by which the militants who lay down arms will be encouraged to join the mainstream and on the other hand, organisations like JeI and JKLF are banned, which have avowedly rejected violence as a method of achieving any goals and have distanced themselves from it,"" said Ms. Mufti.She warned that such repressive measures will shrink the already limited space and ""will only increase the level of alienation and frustration among the people"".A CPI(M) spokesman also warned that such a ban ""doesn’t augur well in a democratic setup"". The decision to ban JKLF is politically motivated. Everyone has a right to dissent in a democratic system. Exclusion of the voices of dissent is against the spirit of a democratic polity,"" said the spokesman in a statement.Injured soldier succumbsAn Army soldier, injured in ceasefire violation by Pakistan on the Line of Control in Poonch on Saturday, auccumbed to his injuries in Sunday morning.A Jammu-based Army spokesman said Grenadier Hari Bhakar had received grave injuries during ceasefire violation in Poonch Sector.

Disinformation is everywhere in India,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/disinformation-is-everywhere-in-india/article26626745.ece,"
It is not only social media that is responsible for it, but also news media and some politicians ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With the Lok Sabha elections coming up, it is critically important that Indians have access to credible and trustworthy information before they vote. The problem is that many do not feel they do. In a brand new survey of English-language Internet users in India conducted by the University of Oxford, we have found that a majority of the respondents are concerned with whether the news they come across online is real or fake.Who can blame them? After thePulwama attack, social media and messaging apps were flooded with false and misleading content as people tried to make sense of the horrible violence. As Trushar Barot, a former BBC journalist who leads Facebook’s integrity initiatives in India, tweeted, “I’ve never seen anything like this before — the scale of fake content circulating on one story.”Some of this was ordinary people sharing misinformation in good faith, but much of it was not. As the Central Reserve Police Force noted a few days after losing 40 men in the attack, “It has been noticed that on social media some miscreants are trying to circulate fake pictures of body parts of our Martyrs to invoke hatred while we stand united. Please DO NOT circulate/share/like such photographs or posts.” Even as some news media made the occasional misstep and amplified some of this disinformation, other journalists and fact-checkers were working overtime to identify and debunk some of the worst examples shared online, including fake or manipulated material trying to link Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, to the attack.The heart of the problemSocial media and messaging apps are thus at the heart of the disinformation problems that India faces. Of our survey respondents, 52% say they get news via Facebook, and the same percentage say they get news via WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook. With an estimated quarter billion Indians having come online since the last general election, companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter have become central parts of the Indian media environment, including the disinformation problems that it faces.But disinformation is not only a problem of social media and digital platforms. In our survey, strikingly, those who use Facebook and/or WhatsApp for news do not report higher levels of concern over whether the news they come across is real or fake than those who do not rely on them. It seems people are as concerned about information from news media as they are about information from social media. More detailed questions in our survey reveal a far more complex set of wider problems. At the heart of disinformation problems are stories that are completely made up for political or commercial reasons, to try to discredit rivals or make money from clickbait. Of our respondents, 51% say they are concerned about this problem. But strikingly, a similar number say they are concerned about what they consider to be poor journalism (stories that respondents consider marred by factual mistakes, inaccuracies, etc.). And 50% say they are concerned by hyperpartisan political content, where facts are spun or twisted to push a particular agenda, whether from politicians, pundits or publishers.So, when many Indians in the run-up to the elections say they are concerned aboutwhat is real and what is fake on the Internet, this is clearly in part about social media and digital platforms. But unfortunately, it is also about some news media and some politicians who people see as part of the disinformation problems that India faces. It is only a few years ago that the Press Council of India said that “the phenomenon of ‘paid news’ has acquired serious dimensions”, “goes beyond the corruption of individual journalists and media companies and has become pervasive, structured and highly organised.” The Press Council concluded: “It is undermining democracy in India.”Cobrapost’s sting operation last summer, which exposed large media houses willing to peddle propaganda as news, demonstrates that some of these problems persist.Low trust in institutionsBeyond the rise of digital media, the backdrop of disinformation problems in India is thus low trust in established institutions. Though there are some admirable exceptions, established institutions often seem to fail the people who rely on them. Other studies have found low trust in politicians and political parties. Our own survey shows that just 36% of respondents feel they can trust most news most of the time, statistically indistinguishable from the 34% who say they trust news found via social media.Addressing the issuesWhat can be done do address these issues? It is clear that platform companies have much to do to improve their content moderation and contain disinformation. Facebook has announced that it currently has over 500 full-time employees and at least 3,500 external contractors who focus on election work, on top of the 30,000 people across the company focused on safety and security issues. (Given the fact that India accounts for more than 10% of the global user base of both Facebook and WhatsApp, and is growing rapidly, it would be good to know how many of these people are focused specifically on India.)Similarly, it is troubling that some coordinated attempts to amplify and spread misleading and false information sometimes seem to emanate from major political parties and activists who support them. This ought to stop, and if it does not, has to be continuously and critically covered by independent journalists to ensure that people are aware of what is going on. Finally, it is clear that Indian news media has a lot of work to do if it wants to gain the trust of the Indian public. Many express high levels of trust in some individual brands, most notably major newspapers and some broadcasters. But many news media are not trusted.In a situation where disinformation seems to be everywhere, and digital platforms, some politicians and some news media are intertwined in these problems, we can only hope that those news media which genuinely do stand out as providers of credible information are able to convince people that they provide exactly that — news that is worthy not only of people’s attention, but also their trust.Rasmus Kleis Nielsen is Director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism and Professor of Political Communication at the University of Oxford.

But their rivals with an intention to bring them out smashed the window panes and damaged the vehicles parked there.On getting information, the Vellore North police rushed to the spot and rescued the Gokul’s gang members.Previous enmity between Gokul’s gang and another man named Kuppan was said to the reason for the clash. Senior police officials visited the spot and conducted an inquiry.“This is not the first time these gang wars have taken place in Vellore. Gokul and Tamizhmani’s father G.G. Ravi was murdered by a gang for his involvement in group rivalry. It was a mystery how the gang members burnt cars escaped the eyes of the police, as they contained lot of weapons inside it,” said a social activist from Sainathapuram in Vellore."

By questioning the morality of those around us, how can we ensure they do not put us in harm’s way?
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"How can hurting people one doesn’t know, be a solution to personal disappointments? What could possibly be satisfying about shooting a crowd of people who have gathered for prayer or driving a truck of explosives into a market place? This is the baseline profile of the social killer. We do not seem to be prepared for it because, as a society which has designed numerous systems to keep order, we are failing quite spectacularly to identify human time bombs as they grow in our midst.We have to ask ourselves what makes a random killer or a terrorist because, it is a phenomenon on the rise. Are we, all of us, in some sense, to blame for an atmosphere and a moral environment which has produced the kind of person, who was surely not with us 50 years ago? In keeping with the exhibitionism of our times, the shooter live-streamed his demonic act.As technology establishes its dominion over our lives and demolishes distance and time, it also erupts in wrinkles and fissures between people and communities. The very screen which brings virtual landscapes and personalities into your life in an exciting way, also gives you close-ups of differences which were, at one time, blurred by distance. But when messages are sent out repeatedly about the possible threat to local communities from visitor races arriving in search of a better life, it is not very difficult to introduce a thread of fear and move on to active campaigns against populations whose origins lie elsewhere in the world.Matters of consequenceWith isolation and loneliness intensifying and alienation from parents following hard upon teenage years, youngsters spend a lot of time away from their families, and possibly with people they have never met face-to-face, but who reach into their minds through devices. Gradually, wreaking violence on strangers appears more and more attractive and an answer to imaginary grievances and slights. A young man who has grown up without a parent or parents, or neglected by the surviving caretaker or aunt or grandparent, begins to feel an anger against everyone and everything. Someone who plays an electronic game of death and ‘taking’ characters ‘out’— what if he or she shifts to ‘taking out’ real life people?“New Zealand was a safe place. Until now,” opened an email I received from my writer friend who is visiting family in that country. When the perpetrator shows not the slightest repentance for what he has done, it signals an ethical emergency which anyone who has anything to do with raising children and training young minds, needs to counter. There are researched courses on how to be a better manager of people, a better speaker, and so on. What about a course on being a better person?A dramatic 18th century painting by Benigne-Gagneraux shows four powerful horses: black, roan, grey and brown being controlled and halted in full gallop. Their reins are held back by a delicate looking youth, unclothed, but for a robe wrapped decoratively about his middle. The helmet and sword of Mars, the Greek god of war, lie on the ground. His chariot stands still. The genius of peace, of freedom has won without weapons. Art and literature have a great deal to teach us, if only we would find the time to draw on our heritage of humanism.If readings in peace and personal ethics are not taught in schools and actively worked into curricula all over the world, at the undergraduate level, with teacher training to support it, we can never hope for better times.The writer is Series Editor, Living in Harmony, OUP India .As technology establishes its dominion over our livesand demolishes distance and time, it also erupts inwrinkles and fissures between people and communities."
That order and peace amidst the seeming chaos,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/that-order-and-peace-amidst-the-seeming-chaos/article26620379.ece,"
Why on a cricket field the game becomes the faith, at least during the phase of childhood ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Have you ever played cricket on a playground where fifty to sixty kids play all at the same time? You may not have played in one but you must have seen one such playground, for sure.I’ve played in one such ground when I was a kid. The number may have crossed 100 today in a similar-size playground. Thanks to fast urban development.I happened to pass by one such playground recently. The sight brought me a smile instantaneously, rekindled my memory and took me back to my childhood days of playing cricket. And interestingly, it made me draw a parallel between childhood and adulthood, though each on a different milieu.At first glance, an outsider will notice that it’s utter chaos on the ground. There will be five to six different groups playing cricket at the same time. An onlooker will have no idea who is playing for which group. On watching closely, he or she’ll be awestruck to find total order and peace amidst the chaos. What brings the peace to these kids?Briefly, let’s get back to the anatomy of the chaos. Each group is a mix of eight to 15 kids and everyone is completely aware of who the rest of the members of their team are. Each group needs just three sticks for stumps (three lines drawn on the wall does the job as well), a bat and a ball. The group will democratically decide on the rules that they abide for the game, that is, the boundary, total overs per side, team size, and so on. For example, one group will decide to have a smaller boundary but maintain a 2G, 3G (something that was invented years before the spectrum technology came to exist). For the unfortunate ones who don’t know, 2G are basically runs granted. If the ball rolls to the shorter boundary, it’s two runs granted.Some groups may have a larger boundary but may play with ‘one bounce catch’, that is, the batsman is given out if the batsman hits the ball and the fielder catches the ball on the first bounce. Some groups play only on-side field, where the batsman can get to score runs only on the on-side field. Most groups play with no LBW. Some groups may decide to play 15 overs a side and some other may decide to play eight overs a side. Some groups may shuffle players after a game but others may decide to stick to same side for the day. Some may go with proper bowling and others may just go with throws instead of bowling. It’s all the same cricket with different flavours.Interestingly, every group very well know their boundary limits, though they are not clearly marked, even as the boundary of other groups overlaps like a complex Venn diagram. No group tries to dominate the other by resorting to violence or intimidate others by using sheer strength. No group tries to allure kids from other groups by playing with expensive balls, bats and stumps. No group canvasses others to follow their way of the game. No one group believes their way of the game is the only way to attain the bliss and the rest are not.More important, no group ever wants or even intends to gather enough strength, drive others out and occupy the entire playground. Every group respects every other group and never interferes. On bigger occasions like holidays, tournaments are conducted on the playground. Every group plays against other and the playground is akin to a festival ground.When children play on such a playground, all that matter to them is their cricket, where the game is their faith and pitch is theirsanctum sanctorum. It’s the sheer bliss of playing cricket within their group. The bliss brings the immense peace amidst chaos. No wonder when people say cricket by itself is a religion in India.I don’t think I need to comment on the parallel that I drew between childhood and adulthood. I do want to mention the fact that we, deep down in our hearts, search for the bliss, which we lost at some point during the transition from childhood to adulthood. Don’t we all?[email protected]"

Having won Best Feature at Big Sky Documentary Film Festival, ‘Pariah Dog’ is a poetic ode to the human heroes who work towards a safer future for native dogs
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A busy street in Kolkata buzzes with several scooters zipping back and forth on their daily commutes. What catches the eye, however, is a puppy, seeking direction, clearly terrified. But the puppy, injured and in pain, starts to cross the road, inch by inch, with no vehicles slowing down and no human bending to help. Does the terrified little one make it? This is one of the scenes inPariah Dog, a film by Jesse Alk and his team.Pariah Dogis not your traditional documentary, though some may categorise it as one. There’s no over-explaining and that’s what filmmaker New York-based Jesse Alk envisioned for film from the initial stages. Alk comes from a unique breed of filmmakers which has helped shape his current filmmaking philosophy, which he pegs as “experiential.”The film follows three people in Kolkata who share their hopes and dreams for native dogs, often facing ostracism or potential violence while pursuing their mission. While the story is centred on Kolkata, one would still see pan-India references.Seeing dogs pretty much everywhere struck a chord with Alk who frequents India. The idea to do a film took root then and there; seeing it from the perspective as a visitor was one thing but approaching it as a filmmaker was something else. “These dogs have their little parallel society alongside humans, connected with ideas of ‘unseen’ or ‘ubiquitous.’ ... I knew what I wanted to do was a visual sensory thing of showing the animals with these people in this city. The intention didn’t include explaining any history. I try to get microscopic if possible.”Copious amounts of research went into the pre-production forPariah Dog, including countless conversations with many people in the native dog awareness communities. “There’s not a lot of context in the film intentionally, but I had to know all that context. I met with a lot of great people and because of those conversations, my understanding of the position of native dogs changed over time after seeing the ecosystems in which they live and how they relate to the city. As a Westerner, we can think ‘oh my goodness, all these dogs!’ and it takes a minute to understand that these aren’t stray dogs, they’re native Indian dogs.”Multi-sensory storytellingFor Alk, the best part of bringing the film to life was the collaboration of the different energies behindPariah Dog, while adding, “The sound was something we really thought about early on; I knew the sound of Kolkata wasn’t something I wanted to recreate in post. We ran microphones everywhere, often running one or two stereo mics at the same time. I did the sound work back here in the United States and Brian Rund was incredibly generous with his time make sure there wasn’t any inauthentic audio.”The subject matter, being ever-developing and detailed, proved that packing the story into a single film was no small feat. “I could have made several films out of the material we collected. It was pretty difficult; I went through eight different versions of the film. I knew I wanted a poetic feeling of Kolkata and to have as many intimate moments with these human characters as I could. So when I focussed on that, unfortunately what had to go was a lot of dog footage and vignettes – the hardest and final cut.”With the sensitive subject matter, Alk experienced moments of conflict – intervention versus documentation. “The most difficult moment is the crippled puppy crossing the road, and I didn’t know what the right answer was. But then you see this kid come pick up the puppy. It looks staged but it definitely wasn’t; the relief I felt was huge.”At one point Alk wasn’t sure howPariah Dogwould be received but, in February, when the film showed at Big Sky Documentary Film Festival in Montana, it won Best Feature. “Some people found themselves covering their eyes at the more saddening parts, but I left those in intentionally, while the reactions were strongly positive. People connected with the characters; I was surprised people understood the thematics, that the film is about dogs but also about loneliness, making meaning in our lives and deeper existential things.”Alk is currently in talks about film distribution with hopes that India as a main audience gets priority viewing.The crewJesse Alk:Producer/Director/CinematographerNoah Lerner:Co-ProducerAditi Sircar:Executive ProducerKoustav Sinha:Assistant Director/Sound Recordist/Co-WriterRajib Kuila:Assistant CameraBrian Rund:Sound Designer/Re-recording MixerJoe Miuccio:Sound EditorChad Smith:ColouristNicefactory:GraphicsThe film follows three people in Kolkata who share their hopes and dreams for native dogs, often facing ostracism or potential violence while pursuing their mission."

Party attacks Modi over the greetings sent to his counterpart for National Day
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Congress on Saturday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of using anti-Pakistan rhetoric merely to drum up support for his politics domestically, even as he dealt with Islamabad in a surreptitious manner. Citing an unpublicised letter from Mr. Modi to Pakistan Prime MinisterImran Khan on Pakistan’s National Day, the Congress said Mr. Modi should stop writing “love letters”.On Friday, the BJP had sought to play up anti-Pakistan sentiments by attacking the Congress for its leader Sam Pitroda’s comments. India had also boycotted a reception at the Pakistan High Commission here to mark the National Day.Turning the tables on the BJP, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted: “#Chowkidar hid the fact that he had wished Pak PM on Pak National Day without a word on Pak terrorism. Muscular politics soap opera for people and media..”Confirmation of Mr. Modi’s greetings came in a tweet by Mr. Khan. “I welcome PM Modi’s message to our people. As we celebrate Pakistan Day I believe it is time to begin a comprehensive dialogue with India to address & resolve all issues, especially the central issue of Kashmir and forge a new relationship based on peace & prosperity for all our people,” Pakistan’s PM had tweeted on Friday night.The government is now trying to underplay the message by saying it was only a “customary greeting.”According to sources, Mr. Modi had in a letter to Mr. Khan said that it was time for the people of the sub-continent to work together for a democratic, peaceful, progressive and prosperous region, in an atmosphere free of terror and violence.Also ReadPakistan calls for peace with India as it shows off its military mightTagging a video of Mr. Modi’s interview to a channel during the UPA time, when Mr. Modi is heard saying “Pakistan needs to be talked to in the language it understands and that writing love letters to it should be stopped,” Mr. Surjewala took a swipe at Mr. Modi. “Modiji, Stop writing this Love Letter to Pakistan.” Mr. Modi had at the time been critical of the then PM Manmohan Singh’s letter to the leadership in Pakistan.Meanwhile, BJP president Amit Shah continued his attack on the Congress over Mr. Pitroda’s comments. Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters, Mr. Shah demanded an apology from the Congress president. Asserting that Mr. Pitroda’s statement appeared to convey the impression that the Pulwama attack was a “routine” incident carried out by a few people for which Pakistan could not be blamed, the BJP chief asked Mr. Gandhi to make his party’s stand clear on the issue."
To tell the ‘real story’ of the East End women,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/to-tell-the-real-story-of-the-east-end-women/article26620211.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In 2015, the opening of a Jack the Ripper museum in East London was met with angry protests. The museum’s backers had initially pitched the project as one that would be a break from the gory focus on the serial killer and the murders that took place between 1888 and 1891. A planning application made by the museum had pledged to make it a resource dedicated to the history of women in the East End — the area where many of the brutal killings took place. “The museum will recognise and celebrate the women of the East End who have shaped history, telling the story of how they have been instrumental in changing society. It will analyse the social, political and domestic experience from the Victorian period to the present day,” it pledged.However, the museum’s focus on the murders (it also runs the Jack the Ripper Museum walks that pledges to take you “in the footsteps of Jack the Ripper and his victims”) and the innumerable theories around those events and the continued mystery surrounding them spurred much public anger. “We are faced with a museum that celebrates gory violence against women,” wrote Becky Warnock, who launched an online campaign to close the museum down, which garnered thousands of signatures.The campaign didn’t stop at regular demonstrations. Following a fundraising campaign in 2016, a pop-up museum round-the-corner from the Ripper museum was opened to tell the “real story” of the East End women. “Celebrate Suffragettes, Not Serial Killers,” proclaimed a billboard that the campaigners took on just opposite the Ripper museum.Public history projectCampaigners have also sought to challenge the planning application on which the museum had based its plans, attempting to get it revoked. This has so far proved unsuccessful, but the plans have grown into a longer-term project, with plans for a permanent space devoted to telling the stories of the women of London’s East End — a public history project to “record, share and celebrate,” women’s stories and voices.“When a proposed women’s history museum on Cable Street in East London turned out to be an excuse to cash in on the popularity of a misogynist serial killer, we decided to make the missing museum a reality,” explain its organisers on the project’s website. “Crass Jack the Ripper tourism is nothing new, but the new museum on Cable Street represents a huge missed opportunity. East London has an incredibly rich social, political, and cultural history and women were part of all of it although their voices are seldom heard. Those are the stories we want to tell; stories that illuminate the lives of East End women, not only their deaths.”It is set to open in a permanent home at the end of this year, in the East London neighbourhood of Barking and Dagenham, focussed on the women of the area who over the centuries fought for women’s rights and equal pay — from the philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft to the women who were involved in the 1968 strike at the Ford factory in Dagenham that helped set the scene for Britain’s equal pay legislation.However, while some have sought to shift the narrative of East London firmly away from the Ripper story, others have tried to tell the story of the women who were his victims. This month, the English National Opera in London is set to open (for a second time) an operaThe Women of Whitechapel, focussing on some of the victims. A new book,The Five, by British social historian Hallie Rubenhold, tells the story of Mary Ann Nicholas, Annie Chapman, Catherine Eddowes, Mary Jane Kelly and Elizabeth Stride, who were brutally murdered in the same year in East London, and the story of whose murders helped build the “myth” of the Ripper.“There’s no doubt that the story of Jack the Ripper is a good yarn... unfortunately, this is also a one-sided story and the hunt for the killer has taken centre stage,” concludes the book. “The larger his profile grows, the more those of his victims seem to fade...” she concludes. “By embracing him, we embrace the set of values that surrounded him in 1888 which teaches women that they are of a lesser value and can expect to be dishonoured and abused... it is only by bringing these women back to life that we can silence the Ripper and what he represents.”Vidya Ram isThe Hindu’s London correspondent"

An architect on the jarring inequalities that confront our divided cities
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On the surface Gautam Bhatia, architect, artist, social historian could be said to have been one of the chosen ones. Not just endowed with a silver spoon, but a silvered sugar bowl, tray and tea-set.With these he has stirred the landscape of architecture with a barrage of words that have now become a short-hand for all the jarring inequalities that confront our urban lifestyles.Paradoxes define modern Indian aesthetics. They have only multiplied since the days when Bhatia first defined the hybrid nature of architectural aspirations in the terms he chose for his first book on Punjabi Baroque, or Bania Gothic.‘Gulfistan, Lootgayens’In those distant days we did not talk of memes that could mutate and take on a life of their own.Taking a hint from Bhatia’s own glossary, we can come up with our own. For instance, the rise of ‘Gulfistan’ in the Gulf money-inspired houses of Kerala; the loss of the village in Gurugonia; the despoiling of Lootgayens bungalows as political prizes to be guarded with annexes for security purposes; the rise of Slumburbia encircling our cities with Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum as a prime destination in the Poverty Tourism category.Bhatia is, however, not the first to describe the gross disparity that defines our divided cities.In what was the first and most blistering attack on how the obscene disparity between the growing wealth of a small segment of the Indian elite and the vast majority would certainly lead to violence, the social critic David Selbourne who visited India during the Emergency years had this to say: “In addition, the miseries and strengths of the people arrayed and encamped on the land-mass of India, toiling and wasting in their hundreds of millions — at best, deceived, inert and pauperized, at worst alert and organized — indict and endanger power. As they are and as they stand, their very visibility and ubiquity are a source of danger to minority classes and factions. The constant and latent fear of the awesome power of the people, both inchoate and focused, arouses not only the reflexes of paternalism, contempt and hatred, but also violence. The use of such violence is the reflex of power; and redoubled violence, the reflex of power corrupted and additionally embattled.”Wealth as mirageAdd to this the impact of the burgeoning population, the electronic age with its tantalising ability to mythologise the good life, only to make it a mirage to the majority, the rise of a soulless middle class — reading Bhatia will confirm that there is worse to come.His is not just a cry in the wilderness. It’s a stunning indictment of not just the architect who has willingly submitted to the degradation that we see around us, but to the rest of us. We, the consumers, the deal-makers who have colluded with the official apparatus to destroy the landscape and its finite resources to fuel the insatiable need for power and self-gratification.A group of 13 architects organised a travelling exhibition entitled ‘The Death of Architecture. Circa 2000’ last year. As they explained in their brochure, “Through evocative art works, poetry and prose, the exhibition decodes and amplifies actions some of which are orchestrated, others inconsiderate. The exhibition presents evidence that will allow discussions about our present, and yet at the same time is embedded with clues and signs that can help effect meaningful dialogues about the future.”This is where one has a problem with Bhatia’s project. His despair is akin to Jean Paul Sartre’s ‘Nausea’, a rejection of the system that is so acute that there seems no way out of it. Even the choices of images border on the vapid and the absurd.There are for instance a couple of montages that show Gandhi as Prince Charles standing next to a simpering Lady Diana, a conductor of a symphony orchestra etc.When he offers potted histories of famous architects of the past, it’s to tell us that Le Corbusier opted to drown himself at the end of a successful career, Frank Lloyd Wright did not smile, Mies van der Rohe was a space cadet with a passion for chairs, Robert Venturi created a bricolage of random choices.For an artist and a man of his sensibility, Bhatia has allowed Punjabi Baroque to erode his soul. One can only weep for him, not with him.Stories of Storeys: Art, Architecture and the CityGautam BhatiaYoda Press/Sage SelectRs. 895"

What you see in these works is not always palatable, but it is conveyed so exquisitely that it subverts every notion of beauty
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Last month, one of the most striking works on display at Threshold Art Gallery, situated in the leafy neighbourhood of New Delhi’s Sarvodaya Enclave, was ‘The Opera that Came Our Way’. This 2018 work, created with coffee, natural pigments and gouache on paper, featured swathes of bright yellow at the centre, with ornate embellishments on the margins. On closer look, one realised that the ornamentation was a deception — a camouflage of sorts — for layers of imagery of subtle violence and chaos. One could see swirls of clouds, interspersed with skeletal figures and captive birds. The visuals seemed otherworldly, steeped in Mughal and Persian miniature traditions, and yet the narrative was very contemporary — firmly enmeshed in the reality of our times.Titled ‘Carrion Culture and Other Stories’, the solo show by artist Anindita Bhattacharya featured such small and large works, divided into eight sections. “The aesthetic trope of her vocabulary allures and encourages the viewer to travel through centuries of history, cultures and traditions but they are all marshalled to hold a mirror to contemporary realities; the fraying of our syncretic tradition, the disquiet of a world torn asunder with rhetoric laden with violence…,” wrote Indrapramit Roy, professor, Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU Baroda, and one of Bhattacharya’s mentors.One could find a range of references — from Gothic gargoyles to the Turkish monsters of Siyeh Qalam, and even Harry Potter — drawn from the artist’s personal experiences. “The lines between the personal and political blur,” said Bhattacharya.The artist likes to work in layers. For instance, in ‘The Opera’, one can find at least 50 layers of yellow. This allows her to juxtapose various experiences across time frames, “working on many levels of partial revelation and knowledge, often trying to capture something about the history that brings the past to mind but in a way, that isn’t attempting to reproduce it,” said Bhattacharya in her artist’s note. The multiple layers vie for attention, taking you away from all that is happening around, until they became the focal point. “I like inviting viewers very close so that they can be intimate with my work,” said Bhattacharya. “On the border, you will see skeletal figures, which have been stripped of identity, gender and race, and are not restricted to a particular time.”Attention off-centreShe has been working with miniatures since 2005. However, her interest lies more in thehashiya, or margins, than the centre. Instead of the traditional floral motifs as ornamentation, Bhattacharya uses images, often violent and disturbing, and repeats them for effect. By doing this, she subverts the beauty of the ornamentation. “The embellishment is deceptive. What you see is sometimes not palatable, but it has been put across in such an exquisite way. It is a bit like poetry, which has the ability to convey deep anguish, but beautifully,” said Tunty Chauhan, director, Threshold Art Gallery. In ‘War Rugs’, a suite of 15 works made with natural pigments, gouache on paper and clay, and named after the rugs created in Afghanistan during the 1979 Soviet occupation, Bhattacharya has created a termite trail with clay to reveal the rot in society. ‘(Re)writing on the Wall’ features intricate jaalis, and reinterprets quotes from Vir Savarkar’s treatises on who is a Hindu, and Swami Vivekananda’s speech at the Parliament of World’s Religions in Chicago.Besides Mughal and Persian miniatures, Bhattacharya also makes references to European medicinal manuscripts in her work. ‘Future Relics of a Carrion Culture’, a set of 70 works, refers to an old Turkish medical treatise that states that tooth decay is a result of sins committed by the patient. Bhattacharya played on this by placing hybrid monsters and skeletons within each tooth. “These illustrations by drawn by monks, who followed some very strict parameters. But I would like to believe that they often expressed their views on the socio-political situation by doodling on the margins. Hence, you will find images that are often hilarious and risque,” she said.Bhattacharya is a big believer in slow art — she grinds her own pigments and cuts paper in jaalis. “Lots of things change during the process. I think many decisions take place in a split-second, so it is important that I do everything myself,” she said. The artist brought up the word,runanubandha, several times during the conversation, which refers to the physical memory accumulated by the body over time. “The same thing happens during painting. When we paint, we transfer energy to the work. I keep working on the same paper from beginning to end, so the material also acquires that memory. Each work is done and washed at least 10 times,” she said. “It is only in this way that you can trace the journey of an artist.”When not scouring for ideas, the Delhi-based journalist can be found curled up with a book or daydreaming.The multiple layers strive for your attention, taking you away from all that is happening around, until they become the focal pointWhat you see is sometimes not palatable, but it has been put across in such an exquisite way. It is a bit like poetry, which has that ability to convey deep anguish, but just so beautifully"

Elections likely to prove a tall order for both Muraleedharan and Pradeep Kumar
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Two Assembly members are battling it out in Kozhikode district to become Parliament members.A. Pradeep Kumar, who represents Kozhikode North in the Assembly, is now the LDF candidate for the Kozhikode Lok Sabha seat, while K. Muraleedharan, who represents Vattiyurkavu in Thiruvananthapuram district, is contesting from Vadakara.Though Vadakara comprises two Assembly segments in Kannur district — Thalassery and Koothuparamba — it is generally considered part of Kozhikode. Five other Assembly segments fall in Kozhikode district.And, this is not the first time legislators are running for Lok Sabha seats in Kozhikode. C.H. Mohammed Koya, former Chief Minister and Indian Union Muslim League leader, then an MLA representing Tanur, had contested the Lok Sabha election from Kozhikode in 1962. He had also contested for the Manjeri Lok Sabha seat when he was representing the Kondotty Assembly segment in 1973. Manjeri ceased to exist, but it had the Assembly segments, Beypore and Kunnamangalam, in Kozhikode district.What makes the fight interesting this time is that if A. Pradeep Kumar of the CPI(M) is trying to capture Kozhikode, Congress nominee K. Muraleedharan has been roped in to retain Vadakara. The Congress has been winning both the seats, which many believe are traditionally inclined towards the LDF.Whether the Congress will maintain its winning streak in the April 23 polls is another question. Campaigning in both Lok Sabha constituencies centres around different issues. If development is the focus in Kozhikode, political violence dominates the theme at Vadakara.Campaign managers feel the polls will be a tall order for both legislators. Mr. Pradeep Kumar is a familiar face in the urban segments of Kozhikode North and Kozhikode South.But Mr. Raghavan, who has been consecutively winning the Kozhikode Lok Sabha seat, is equally popular as well and also has a sway in the rural segments.In the case of Mr. Muraleedharan, who has been pitted against CPI(M)’s Kannur district secretary P. Jayarajan, he is not new to Kozhikode as he had represented the Lok Sabha constituency twice.While Mr. Muraleedharan has tasted defeats in Assembly polls, Mr. Jayarajan had won three times, including the Koothuparamba assembly bypoll.Incidentally, both the CPI(M) candidates also belong to the Lok Sabha constituencies they contest. But Mr. Raghavan, hailing from Kannur, has shifted his residence to Kozhikode after the polls in 2009. Mr. Muraleedharan also hails from Kozhikode though he shifted his political base to Thiruvananthapuram. According to Congressmen, Muraleedharan’s contest from Vadakara will revive the fortunes of the party in Malabar."

As we celebrate Pakistan Day I believe it is time to begin a comprehensive dialogue with India to address & resolve all issues, esp the central issue of Kashmir, & forge a new relationship based on peace & prosperity for all our people.”Mr. Khan’s tweets created a stir on both sides of the border. At a time when both countries were almost on the brink of a full-fledged war just a few weeks ago, PM Modi’s message is quite important.Political analysts and journalists in Pakistan said Mr. Modi’s message was a welcome gesture.Political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi said Mr. Modi’s message was a refreshing change for a leader that, only a month ago, was beating the war drums. “If Pakistan’s consistent pro-normalisation approach since the spring of 2018 eventually yields better relations, it will be to the benefit of both countries.”Journalist Beena Sarwar said that Prime Minister Modi’s message to Prime Minister Imran Khan was the kind of diplomatic overture that this region sorely needed. “Both countries need to translate this goodwill into action on an urgent basis. Stop putting conditions on the talks. Dialogue should be un-interrupted and un-interruptible. Focus on the low-hanging fruits.”Ms. Sarwar added that both countries should ease visa restrictions, let people meet, trade and travel. “If they can do this, they will bring peace and prosperity to the region and go down in history as the men who made it happen,” she said.Anchorperson Meher Bokhari felt that the message it was very uncharacteristic and added to the unpredictability of Mr. Modi as as a leader. “Reaching out during a time of strained hostile relations between the two countries, at the helm of elections, can be seen as an attempt to be portryed as a balanced leader, contrary to how the Indian opposition is painting him — a war mongering desperate man willing to do anything to bag the next election,” said Ms. Bokhari.Former High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit, however, said that it was a routine message, “reiterating the mantra of terror and talks cannot go together”.He also pointed out that it was “interesting is that it has been tweeted by Imran Khan and not Modi”."

In north Kerala, however, the cult of political violence and murders would dominate the debate given that the impact of the Sabarimala issue would, largely, be marginal.Central Travancore is set to be the epicentre of the electoral battle as all the three coalitions — the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) — have concentrated their energies in this region’s seats, which were traditionally reckoned as the core electoral base of the UDF. The constituencies in this belt have a unique brand of politics, enmeshed as it is in caste and religious denominational propensities. The UDF has traditionally derived its strength from the Nair-Christian combination, which included steadfast support of the smaller denominations.The Sabarimala issue was perhaps one of the most emotive issues that rocked the Hindu community in the State in recent years. The agitation against the Supreme Court verdict, which began on an apolitical and peaceful note, acquired a political dimension when the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) seeing a big opportunity for a breakthrough in Kerala’s bipolar politics tried to steer it on a violent course. The LDF government, led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, sought to counter the BJP by maintaining that it was constitutionally bound to implement the apex court’s verdict. It took strong police action against the violent agitation, sponsored by the Sangh Parivar outfits.The UDF took the stand that the women’s entry issue was all about faith and the preservation of religious traditions and customs, something which it argued was applicable to all religions. The role of the Nair Service Society (NSS), which while opposed to the Sabarimala court verdict did not endorse the BJP’s violent tack, was also significant.For its part, the LDF Government promoted a new renaissance platform in an attempt to rekindle the memories of the social reformation movement and tap into the angst of the relatively less affluent and struggling castes including the Dalits to counter the BJP’s efforts at Hindu consolidation. Mr. Vijayan also promoted the ‘human wall’ by women in a big way to lend a ‘progressive’ facet to the government’s actions related to Sabarimala.And the choice of the three combines’ candidates has been based on a calculus reflective of their agendas. The BJP, which has bet big on Pathanamthitta in the hope of capitalising on the Sabarimala issue, has fielded State general secretary K. Surendran, who was at the forefront of the agitation.The CPI(M) has opted to experiment by fielding a Muslim candidate, A.M. Ariff, from a south Kerala constituency for the first time. Mr. Ariff, an MLA, will contest Alappuzha. The LDF is also making attempts to shake the UDF’s base by reaching out to various Christian denominations such as the Malankara Orthodox community. It is trying to repeat the success it got in the 2016 Assembly elections by fielding the same candidate, Veena George for Pathanamthitta, where the Orthodox community has sizeable votes. Ms. George had won the Aranmula Assembly seat for the LDF, as an independent candidate, in 2016.The UDF has stuck to its usual combination, fielding a Muslim candidate from one of the south Kerala constituencies, besides giving representation to all other sections. It also hopes to rework the old Nair-Christian equation on the strength of the support of the NSS, which has a rather uncomfortable relationship with the LDF and is opposed to the BJP. Each alliance claims that it can make headway in Central Travancore, but none of them are too sure how the undercurrents would work.In north Kerala, political violence occupies centre stage — in a region where equations are largely based on rock-hard political preferences shaped by ideological loyalties. The brutal murders of Youth Congress workers Kripesh and Sarath Lal in Kasaragod last month have catapulted the vengeance-driven culture of violent political rivalry to the forefront of the campaign here.The CPI(M)’s decision to field P Jayarajan, a leader who has been identified with the cult of political violence, will certainly create undercurrents during the elections. The presence of Mr. Jayarajan, who is facing charges in cases related to the murder of Abdul Shukkoor, a Muslim Students Federation activist, and K. Manoj, an RSS worker, has ensured that political violence will not be just a subtext to the larger issues in the Vadakara constituency, where the murder of Revolutionary Marxist Party leader T.P. Chandrashekharan is still fresh in people’s minds.The implication of the Congress’s decision to field Rajmohan Unnithan, K. Sudhakaran and K. Muraleedharan in Kasaragod, Kannur and Vadakara Lok Sabha constituencies respectively has not gone unnoticed. Vociferous leaders as they are, they have already set the stage for highlighting political violence as a major issue on the campaign front.“Of course, political violence is a deciding factor in the election campaign in northern Kerala and the electoral outcomes will depend on how effectively the CPI(M) defends the allegations of party workers’ involvement in the murders of political rivals,” said K. Balachandran, a former Programme Head of All India Radio, Kannur. Voters were confused as all the political groups were equally responsible for political violence, he added.The UDF would look to highlight the murders of Shukkoor and Youth Congress worker S.P. Shuhaib in an attempt to pick holes in the CPI(M)’s claim that the LDF is in the forefront of the fight to protect the minorities."

An architect on the gross disparity that defines our divided cities
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On the surface Gautam Bhatia, architect, artist, social historian could be said to have been one of the chosen ones. Not just endowed with a silver spoon, but a silvered sugar bowl, tray and tea-set.With these he has stirred the landscape of architecture with a barrage of words that have now become a short-hand for all the jarring inequalities that confront our urban lifestyles.Paradoxes define modern Indian aesthetics. They have only multiplied since the days when Bhatia first defined the hybrid nature of architectural aspirations in the terms he chose for his first book on Punjabi Baroque, or Bania Gothic.‘Gulfistan, Lootgayens’In those distant days we did not talk of memes that could mutate and take on a life of their own.Taking a hint from Bhatia’s own glossary, we can come up with our own. For instance, the rise of ‘Gulfistan’ in the Gulf money-inspired houses of Kerala; the loss of the village in Gurugonia; the despoiling of Lootgayens bungalows as political prizes to be guarded with annexes for security purposes; the rise of Slumburbia encircling our cities with Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum as a prime destination in the Poverty Tourism category.Bhatia is, however, not the first to describe the gross disparity that defines our divided cities.In what was the first and most blistering attack on how the obscene disparity between the growing wealth of a small segment of the Indian elite and the vast majority would certainly lead to violence, the social critic David Selbourne who visited India during the Emergency years had this to say: “In addition, the miseries and strengths of the people arrayed and encamped on the land-mass of India, toiling and wasting in their hundreds of millions — at best, deceived, inert and pauperized, at worst alert and organized — indict and endanger power. As they are and as they stand, their very visibility and ubiquity are a source of danger to minority classes and factions. The constant and latent fear of the awesome power of the people, both inchoate and focused, arouses not only the reflexes of paternalism, contempt and hatred, but also violence. The use of such violence is the reflex of power; and redoubled violence, the reflex of power corrupted and additionally embattled.”Wealth as mirageAdd to this the impact of the burgeoning population, the electronic age with its tantalising ability to mythologise the good life, only to make it a mirage to the majority, the rise of a soulless middle class — reading Bhatia will confirm that there is worse to come.His is not just a cry in the wilderness. It’s a stunning indictment of not just the architect who has willingly submitted to the degradation that we see around us, but to the rest of us. We, the consumers, the deal-makers who have colluded with the official apparatus to destroy the landscape and its finite resources to fuel the insatiable need for power and self-gratification.A group of 13 architects organised a travelling exhibition entitled ‘The Death of Architecture. Circa 2000’ last year. As they explained in their brochure, “Through evocative art works, poetry and prose, the exhibition decodes and amplifies actions some of which are orchestrated, others inconsiderate. The exhibition presents evidence that will allow discussions about our present, and yet at the same time is embedded with clues and signs that can help effect meaningful dialogues about the future.”This is where one has a problem with Bhatia’s project. His despair is akin to Jean Paul Sartre’s ‘Nausea’, a rejection of the system that is so acute that there seems no way out of it. Even the choices of images border on the vapid and the absurd.There are for instance a couple of montages that show Gandhi as Prince Charles standing next to a simpering Lady Diana, a conductor of a symphony orchestra etc.When he offers potted histories of famous architects of the past, it’s to tell us that Le Corbusier opted to drown himself at the end of a successful career, Frank Lloyd Wright did not smile, Mies van der Rohe was a space cadet with a passion for chairs, Robert Venturi created a bricolage of random choices.For an artist and a man of his sensibility, Bhatia has allowed Punjabi Baroque to erode his soul. One can only weep for him, not with him.Stories of Storeys: Art, Architecture and the City; Gautam Bhatia, Yoda Press/ Sage Select, ₹895."
‘Modi is chowkidar for AIADMK’,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/modi-is-chowkidar-for-aiadmk/article26614713.ece,"
Fear and money basis for their alliance, says Stalin ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"DMK leader M.K. Stalin on Friday charged that ‘Chowkidar’ Narendra Modi was actually the ‘chowkidar’ (watchman) for the “corrupt and minority” AIADMK government headed by Edappadi K. Palaniswami.Alleging that the BJP and AIADMK had aligned only on the basis of fear (of prosecution) and money, he said in Dharmapuri that “there’s no reason why AIADMK would ally with the BJP that competed with NOTA votes”.At a public meeting, Mr. Stalin harped on how in early 2017 AIADMK coordinator O.Panneerselvam had launched his ‘Dharma Yudham’ against the Palaniswami faction before joining hands with him. He recalled that PMK founder S. Ramadoss, now an ally of the AIADMK, had written a book on the AIADMK and corruption. “That book has not come in handy for us. Mr. Ramadoss had said in the book that under the AIADMK regime a loot of ₹70,000 crore had happened,” he said.In Paapireddypatty, a Vanniyar bastion, Mr. Stalin accused Mr. Ramadoss and his son Anbumani of betraying “Vanniyar interests”.“The DMK is a party that had secured 20% reservation for the Vanniyars. But, the PMK has defamed the DMK, and the father-son duo had failed the community’s interests,” he charged.Responding to Mr. Ramadoss dubbing the DMK as a ‘violent party’, Mr. Stalin read out a special call attention motion by Jayalalithaa in the Assembly. According to Mr. Stalin, Jayalalithaa had dubbed the PMK as a party that was bereft of a decent grammar that should define a political party. PMK was a party that vandalised public and private property and spoke the language of violence, he said.According to Mr. Stalin, the irony posed by the byelections to the vacant Assembly seats was that the seats were made vacant by the power struggle between Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami."
"Assault on Gurugram Muslim family: ‘Pleading women, children thrashed’",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pleading-women-children-thrashed/article26621389.ece,"
Police arrest one person in assault on Muslim family in Gurugram.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Members of a Muslim family who were thrashed by a group of men on Thursday evening, in Dhamaspur village, said even women and children were not spared despite entreaties.Police said they had arrested one person, identified as Mahesh, resident of a nearby village, after examining a video of the incident that took place on the evening of Holi. “A few others have also been identified but arrests are yet to be made. We are working on the case,” said Gurugram Police PRO Subhash Boken.Muslim Ekta Manch Chairman Hazi Shahzad Khan said that based on the video, the group had identified the accused and given names to police but the latter were not taking any strict action.Speaking to the media on Saturday, Afifa,5, recalled that as “a lot of men” entered their house and started beating her family members, she held her two- year-old cousin Zia and hid inside an almirah. “But they opened the almirah, took Zia from my hands and threw her on the bed,” she claimed. Another child, three-year-old Zaki hid under a bed to escape the assault, the victims said.Of the 12 persons who sustained injuries, four are women and three minors, the family said.Recalling the incident, one of the injured Dilshad, 30, a resident of Gurugram’s Badshahpur, said he and his family were visiting their paternal uncle Sajid in Bhoop Nagar where the incident occurred, on Holi.In evening around 4:30, we decided to play cricket. As we were playing, two men came on a bike and said ‘Mullah kya kar rahe ho(Mullah what are you doing)?’ We said we were playing and they said ‘Pakistan jaake khelo’(Go to Pakistan and play)” Mr. Dilshad recalled.As Mr Sajid tried to intervene in the argument, two of the men slapped him. When he objected, the accused allegedly told the family that they would return and teach them a lesson.The family members said they then abandoned their game of cricket and returned home went back inside the house and were sitting near the main gate when six men on two bikes and a few on foot armed with wooden sticks in their hand barged in and started beating them.“The women were cooking on the terrace. We ran towards the terrace where they thrashed us. My mother kept apologising and pleading with them but they didn’t stop. She apologised just so they would leave us,” alleged Mr. Dilshad.The family also alleged that a Zila Parishad Councillor’s father-in-law Balraj Badhana visited them on Friday and asked them to reach a compromise with the attackers. “Unhone kaha aapas main suleh karlo, ek hi gaon ki baat hai(He asked to cordially end the matter and let the matter be within the village),” claimed Mr Sajid.Mr Badhana, however, denied the claim and said he never made the statement. “I said I am with them and culprits should be brought to justice. However, it should not be made into a communal incident because both sides have sustained injuries. It was a fight over playing cricket and this family held one of the opposite group’s man hostage because of which they entered the house. I’ve met the other side too,” he claimed.Mr Sajid said he has been staying in the locality for nearly three years and has never felt threatened. He said that while it was a Hindu dominated area, people live cordially. Mr Sajid also claimed that he had not seen the accused before.Mr Dilshad who resides in Badshahpur, however, said that while his locality was peaceful, there were sometimes comments with religious undertones thrown at him which he ignores. “We are migrants here who’ve come to work and this is not our place. Locals feel powerful and we have to live with that,” he said."
Ban on students’ union polls sees parties scrambling to identify youth leaders,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/ban-on-students-union-polls-sees-parties-scrambling-to-identify-youth-leaders/article26614491.ece,"
‘The ban has raised barriers for student leaders’ entry into politics and skewed new entrants’ profile’ ",,"In many parts of the country, the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections is witnessing an injection of young blood, with youth leaders such as Kanhaiya Kumar and Shehla Rashid being projected onto the national stage. They are expected to make their electoral debut this year. In Karnataka, however, parties are scrambling to find fresh faces. Veterans are attributing the political vacuum to the ban on student union elections in State universities.Political activists argue that the ban has not only raised barriers for the entry of student leaders into politics but also skewed the profile of new entrants, with parties turning to businessmen and political families for candidates. “The absence of young leaders in the organisation coupled with the rising cost of elections is seeing political parties tilt towards moneyed businessmen or contractors,” said a senior political leader from a national party.An aspiring candidate from a national party believes that the political landscape is loaded against grassroots activists.“The cost of elections has increased several folds and a candidate is expected to foot most of the bill. Even organisational posts are cornered by those from political families. Youth wings of all three major parties have been filled by those from political families,” he said.Harsha Narayan, State secretary, Akhil BharatiyaVidyarthi Parishad, said giving students the responsibility at a young age would help them stay motivated. “The average age of the candidates would come down, and it would curb dynastic politics,” he said.Across parties, the crop of current leaders in the State — Siddaramaiah, P.G.R. Scindia, B.K. Hariprasad, H.M. Revanna, K.R. Ramesh Kumar, and R. Ashok — and deceased leaders Jeevaraj Alva and Anant Kumar have had their roots in students’ union elections. “The elections provide an ideological grooming for leaders because of the issues that are debated. In their absence, even those who overcome the entry barrier and enter the fray are divorced from the ground reality. They are not adequately groomed in the party’s ideology,” said Syed Naseer Hussain, a former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president and a Rajya Sabha member from the Congress.Mr. Hussain started his career as a student leader in Mysuru. He argued that without this framework, candidates who get elected also tend to fall prey to the belief that their work is primarily to provide civic infrastructure, with no commitment to issues such as land and labour. “Organisational grooming in political parties alone is not good enough,” he said.Several members of the Congress, BJP and JD(S) have been batting for students’ union elections to be reintroduced.H.S. Manjunath, State president, National Students’ Union of India, and one of the student leaders to be fielded by the Congress in 2018 Assembly polls, described the experience as a stepping stone to mainstream electoral politics.Banned in early 1990sStudents’ union elections were banned in the early 1990s as they were seen as being responsible for perpetuating caste-based violence in higher education institutions. Higher Education Minister G.T. Deve Gowda had said in November last that the government would lift the ban as it wanted more youngsters to get into politics. At that time, he had said the department would frame guidelines to ensure no untoward incident takes place on college campus.Mr. Hussain said they have been lobbying with successive governments to re-introduce students’ union elections. “There are several reports on students’ union election reforms, including one by the J.M. Lyngdoh committee. We need to structure the elections in such a way that it is centred on debates, and prevent the role of money and muscle power,” he said."

Beyond the ‘us-them’ binary,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/beyond-the-us-them-binary/article26601162.ece,"
By calling the Christchurch attacker a terrorist, the New Zealand Prime Minister sent a powerful message
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Though some media outlets gave it needless coverage, anyone could have expected that the Islamic State (IS) would call for “revenge” following the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings on March 15, in which 50 people lost their lives. At its peak in 2015, the IS had 30,000 fighters and the estimated support of (at the most) half a million Muslims — out of a total world population of an estimated 1.8 billion Muslims in 2015. It also has the reputation of being the organisation that has killed the maximum number of Muslims in recent years, a fact obscured by its gory executions of ‘non-Muslims’.For the IS to urge ‘revenge’ on the behalf of all Muslims was exactly the same as the act of terrorism perpetrated by the Australia-born, white supremacist, alt-right terrorist on men, women and children who had gone to two Christchurch mosques for peaceful Friday congregational prayers on March 15. As his ‘manifesto’ indicates, this young white alt-right male terrorist was also seeking “revenge” for various acts of real or imagined violence by ‘Muslims’. In short, the perpetrator of the Christchurch massacres and the IS are caught in a distorting binary worldview of ‘us versus them’, and inevitably this is the world they will create if the rest of us do not call their bluff.The ‘T’ wordAnd this time, for a change, a world leader called their bluff right at the start. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, not only referred to the attacks as “one of New Zealand’s darkest days” but, more courageously, did not hesitate to call their perpetrator a “terrorist”. By using the ‘T’ word — which is easily applied to terrorising violence by Muslim criminals but tardily applied to similar violence by white supremacist or (in India) Hindutva criminals — Ms. Ardern sent a powerful message. In this, she was supported by her counterpart in Australia, Scott Morrison, who also did not hesitate to describe the perpetrator as a terrorist.The hesitation in the media to describe white extremism or Hindutva violence as terror is a reflection, however diffuse, of exactly that binary division of the world into ‘us versus them’ that I have highlighted. It has its counterpart in the Muslim world too, and I will come to that a bit later. Evidently, Ms. Ardern’s honest description of what happened in Christchurch sent a message not only to the world media but also to Muslims: what she effectively said was that Muslims are not ‘them’ in New Zealand. She highlighted this in many ways, by thoughtful acts of condolence as well as a clear statement in which she embraced the victims (mostly immigrants and refugees) as “one of us”.The good effect of such admirable statesmanship was evident in the responsible way in which the New Zealand media largely covered the tragedy. Those of us in India who are used to our hyperventilating evening shows should have marked this difference. Not that the ‘us-them’ binary disappeared. The tabloid press — not least in England, a country whose inability to face up to its own subterranean prejudices has landed it in the on-going mess of Brexit — still continued, much of the time, to think along those binaries. This was admirably exposed by The Feed, which, among other things, compared the initial front page Christchurch heading ofThe Daily Mirror(‘Angelic boy who grew into an evil far-right killer’) to how the same paper had covered the Orlando nightclub shooting of 2016 (‘ISIS Maniac Kills 50 in Gay Club’).The Feed went on to note, with references, that there is a tendency in sections of the Western media to focus on the ‘humanity’ of the Christchurch murderer, sometimes even before talking of his victims. This contrasts to the normal (correct to my mind) option of focussing on the humanity of the victims when the murderer is a Muslim extremist.Sustaining a worldviewHowever, this ‘us-them’ attitude is not limited to the ‘West’. That large sections of mainstream Muslims also share it was illustrated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who rashly described the Christchurch massacres in terms of a broader attack on Turkey and Muslims. If Ms. Ardern — unlike most other Muslim or non-Muslim leaders in similar situations in the past — showed vision and humanity, Mr. Erdoğan displayed, at best, political expediency. Just as it is easy to whip up anti-Muslim sentiments among many peoples in the West and in places like India, it is easy to whip up the exaggerated bogey of Islamophobia among Muslims all over the world.Yes, extremist ideologies exist among Muslims and other peoples: hence, Islamophobia also exists. But these are sweeping explanations, which finally ‘explain’ by obscuring much on the basis of a prior investment in the ‘us-them’ ideology. While noting the difference in media coverage, The Feed rightly explained it not in terms of a hatred for Muslims but a refusal to see that ‘we’ are not that different from ‘them’. Hence, it is easy to see ‘them’ as maniacs and ‘us’ as fallen angels; it is easy to call ‘them’ terrorists, and ‘us’, well, anything but terrorists. By doing so, we refuse to accept our complicity in sustaining a simplistic and distorted binary worldview that permits such acts of terror — against Muslims, Christians, Hindus, atheists, gay men, women, whatever may be the ‘nature’ of ‘them’ in our book of otherness.Once we have demeaned ‘them’ to a subhuman level, it is easy to kill ‘them’ as if they were not human. Most of us won’t go that far, but most of us do help sustain the ‘us-them’ binary that enables a ‘maniac’ (or ‘fallen angel’) to go that far. This, as Ms. Ardern also noted, is further magnified by the media tendency to give easy publicity to such confused murderers. Don’t name the perpetrator of the Christchurch massacres, she advised. And I, for one, have not.Tabish Khair is an Indian novelist and academic who teaches in Denmark"

Chief Election Commissioner clarifies on article in The Hindu
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In response to the article, ‘The case of the missing election in J&K — The failure to hold Assembly polls shows up problems in the working of the Election Commission’ (OpEd page, March 21), Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora writes:This is with reference to the write-up titled “The case of the missing election in J&K — The failure to hold Assembly polls shows up problems in the working of the Election Commission” written by Shri A.G. Noorani ji, eminent Constitutional expert. In this context I would like to draw your kind attention to the following:While holding the press conference for announcing the schedule of the general election to Lok Sabha and Assemblies of some States on 10.3.2019 at Vigyan Bhavan, the relevant paragraphs about J&K elections read as under:Review meetings“About holding election in Jammu and Kashmir, the Commission has been continuously assessing the prevailing situation in the State, requirement of Central forces and other logistics for elections, requirement of security for the candidates and preparedness of the State for the election on key factors. The Commission had conducted several rounds of review meetings with the MHA [Ministry of Home Affairs] and the State administration of Jammu and Kashmir.The State government of J&K and the Union Home Secretary had sent detailed and specific inputs to the Commission regarding holding elections in the State. To assess the situation and level of preparedness, the Commission had recently visited J&K and had detailed meeting with the political parties, all important Central and State Government agencies, with District Authorities and the Chief Secretary, DGP, Home Secy. and other officials in this matter.Based on the specific inputs and recommendation from the State Government and Union Home Secretary, inputs from the political parties and other stakeholders, constraints of availability of Central forces and other logistics, requirement of security forces for security of candidates in wake of incidents of violence in recent past and keeping other challenges in mind, the Commission has decided to announce only schedule of the Parliament elections in J&K.The Commission will be regularly and on real-time basis monitoring the situation in J&K and will also be taking inputs from all necessary quarters and decision regarding holding Legislative Assembly elections in J&K will be taken soon.Special observersA committee of three very eminent and senior officers has been set up as Special Observers to assess the situation in J&K. Shri Noor Mohammad, lAS (1977, Retd), Shri Vinod Zutshi, lAS (1982, Retd) and Shri A.S. Gill, IPS (1972, retd) have been appointed as Special Observers.Mr. A.S. Gill, a celebrated police officer, has wide experience of working in the field of security management. His special assignments have been of working as IG and DG, CRPF in Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. Noor Mohammad, retired as Secretary, Government of India and has worked in the field of election management for more than a decade. He has also been an international expert and consultant to Afghanistan for many years. He is currently working as senior consultant in the IIIDEM. Mr. Zutshi is a former Secretary, Government of India, and has worked as CEO Rajasthan and Deputy Election Commissioner in ECI for many years. He has long experience in the field of election management and continues to contribute to the Commission as national and international trainer.”The aforementioned paragraphs were a part of the Press Note, dated 10th March, 2019 about schedule of General Elections to Lok Sabha shared with the media and can also be read on the ECI website, www.eci.gov.in.The perusal of aforementioned paragraphs makes it clear that the Commission visited J&K after a series of wide-ranging consultations with Chief Secretary and senior officials of J&K starting with a video conference on 21.1.2019.Appointment processShri Noorani ji has also raised some pertinent points about the procedure of appointment of Election Commissioners and Chief Election Commissioner. All I would like to say in this regard is that this is strictly within the domain of Parliament and Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The Apex Court on 23.10.2018 have already referred this issue to a Constitutional Bench. Since the successive ECs and CECs including the present Commission including me have been appointed as per the extant laws, I have no further comments on this.Regarding the reference to my appointment having raised eyebrows, when I took over as CEC on 2.12.2018, in my opening statement after one or two prefatory remarks I said: All I can say is that I, my peers as well as my colleagues in Election Commission shall continue to put our best foot forward to meet the expectations of the stakeholders strictly in consonance and in conformity with the vision and ideals of the Constitution of India, especially the Preamble thereof."

What you see in her works is not always palatable, but it is conveyed so exquisitely that it subverts every notion of beauty
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Last month, one of the most striking works on display at Threshold Art Gallery, situated in the leafy neighbourhood of New Delhi’s Sarvodaya Enclave, was ‘The Opera that Came Our Way’. This 2018 work, created with coffee, natural pigments and gouache on paper, featured swathes of bright yellow at the centre, with ornate embellishments on the margins. On closer look, one realised that the ornamentation was a deception — a camouflage of sorts — for layers of imagery of subtle violence and chaos. One could see swirls of clouds, interspersed with skeletal figures and captive birds. The visuals seemed otherworldly, steeped in Mughal and Persian miniature traditions, and yet the narrative was very contemporary — firmly enmeshed in the reality of our times.Titled ‘Carrion Culture and Other Stories’, the solo show by artist Anindita Bhattacharya featured such small and large works, divided into eight sections. “The aesthetic trope of her vocabulary allures and encourages the viewer to travel through centuries of history, cultures and traditions but they are all marshalled to hold a mirror to contemporary realities; the fraying of our syncretic tradition, the disquiet of a world torn asunder with rhetoric laden with violence…,” wrote Indrapramit Roy, professor, Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU Baroda, and one of Bhattacharya’s mentors.One could find a range of references — from Gothic gargoyles to the Turkish monsters of Siyeh Qalam, and even Harry Potter — drawn from the artist’s personal experiences. “The lines between the personal and political blur,” said Bhattacharya.The artist likes to work in layers. For instance, in ‘The Opera’, one can find at least 50 layers of yellow. This allows her to juxtapose various experiences across time frames, “working on many levels of partial revelation and knowledge, often trying to capture something about the history that brings the past to mind but in a way, that isn’t attempting to reproduce it,” said Bhattacharya in her artist’s note. The multiple layers vie for attention, taking you away from all that is happening around, until they became the focal point. “I like inviting viewers very close so that they can be intimate with my work,” said Bhattacharya. “On the border, you will see skeletal figures, which have been stripped of identity, gender and race, and are not restricted to a particular time.”She has been working with miniatures since 2005. However, her interest lies more in thehashiya, or margins, than the centre. Instead of the traditional floral motifs as ornamentation, Bhattacharya uses images, often violent and disturbing, and repeats them for effect. By doing this, she subverts the beauty of the ornamentation. “The embellishment is deceptive. What you see is sometimes not palatable, but it has been put across in such an exquisite way. It is a bit like poetry, which has the ability to convey deep anguish, but beautifully,” said Tunty Chauhan, director, Threshold Art Gallery. In ‘War Rugs’, a suite of 15 works made with natural pigments, gouache on paper and clay, and named after the rugs created in Afghanistan during the 1979 Soviet occupation, Bhattacharya has created a termite trail with clay to reveal the rot in society. ‘(Re)writing on the Wall’ features intricate jaalis, and reinterprets quotes from Vir Savarkar’s treatises on who is a Hindu, and Swami Vivekananda’s speech at the Parliament of World’s Religions in Chicago.Besides Mughal and Persian miniatures, Bhattacharya also makes references to European medicinal manuscripts in her work. ‘Future Relics of a Carrion Culture’, a set of 70 works, refers to an old Turkish medical treatise that states that tooth decay is a result of sins committed by the patient. Bhattacharya played on this by placing hybrid monsters and skeletons within each tooth. “These illustrations by drawn by monks, who followed some very strict parameters. But I would like to believe that they often expressed their views on the socio-political situation by doodling on the margins. Hence, you will find images that are often hilarious and risque,” she said.Bhattacharya is a big believer in slow art — she grinds her own pigments and cuts paper in jaalis. “Lots of things change during the process. I think many decisions take place in a split-second, so it is important that I do everything myself,” she said. The artist brought up the word,runanubandha, several times during the conversation, which refers to the physical memory accumulated by the body over time. “The same thing happens during painting. When we paint, we transfer energy to the work. I keep working on the same paper from beginning to end, so the material also acquires that memory. Each work is done and washed at least 10 times,” she said. “It is only in this way that you can trace the journey of an artist.”When not scouring for ideas, the Delhi-based journalist can be found curled up with a book or daydreaming."

From cat videos to the Christchurch massacre, howresponses matter in a livestreamed world
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Last week, a terrorist went on a rampage with semi-automatic weapons in two mosques in New Zealand, killing 49 people. The killer was a white, right-wing extremist who live-streamed his attack.One of the first things that came to mind was the lynching of Mohammad Afrazul in December 2017 in Rajasthan. As Shambhulal Regar hacked Afrazul to death, set him on fire, then made a speech justifying the act, an associate filmed it and posted it online.As right-wing fanaticism rises across the world, this time around it has two added dimensions. First, murder as spectacle and second, murder as self-endorsement. The digital age’s obsession with the photo and the video isn’t confined to the steak you eat and the train-ride you take, but extends to every sad, dark and horrible thought or act you might indulge in. And — frighteningly — if abiriyanilunch gets 5,000 ‘likes’, so too does a lynching. Apparently, the Christchurch killer’s online ‘friends’ hailed him even as the bodies piled up.Such are the cheerful times we live in. And such our greed, our craving for validation. It’s a vicious cycle. Social media quickly gets bored, so users try to go one up on extreme acts, whether of adventure or evil, love or hate. In turn, as the ‘Likes’ mount, it pushes people to bolder and bigger acts. Social media means that you don’t have to be an actor or footballer to be famous anymore. Being involved in self-harm or substance abuse, stress or depression, murder, rape or mob violence — it’s all film worthy and fame worthy. Murderer, model and lynch mob alike get a cheering squad.In this happy democratic paradise of sharing, everything degenerates into a sameness of importance. A cancer patient can raise money for chemotherapy, but equally a tweet that you’re overworked can buy you a ‘cheer-up’ dress. Cat videos, no-date blues, alassi-making film, the killing of Afrazul — anything can go viral, anything can get crowdfunding because everything has the same debased value.In ancient Greece, the worst acts of violence or depravity were consideredob skeneor off-stage: not fit to be seen on stage. ‘Murder’, ‘parricide’, ‘incest’ were considered unscriptable; they occurred off-stage and were described by a witness or the chorus.Ob skeneis considered the origin of the English ‘obscene’. Only, nothing is off-stage today. And so the horror is compounded — once when it happens, then when it is broadcast, then when it is accorded the same response as a music video.It is in this context that New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s statement is important. In simple, powerful words she said that refugees and migrants were all ‘us’. It’s the killer, she said, who is not ‘us’. “There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme violence,” she said. By stating the horror and by refusing to name the killer, Ardern relegated evil back to its dark place.The intent of the Christchurch killer’s video or the Afrazul video is to normalise the killing; to pretend that ‘love jihad’ or ‘immigration’ or ‘beef-eating’ are problems of such magnitude that murder is not only a legitimate response but so legitimate that it can be performed on-stage, in front of a camera, for an audience that endorses it.It is a leader’s duty to treat such thugs as the threat they are and state clearly that nothing justifies slaughter. Nothing. Only this can put rightness back in a world gone mad.It is the absence of such clear denunciation that is worrying in our own country. Dyslexia, sanitation workers, soldiers, lynching, economic data — everything is treated like a Bollywoodphillum. Everything is a photo-op. Any condemnation is first artfully obscured by the red herrings: ‘Nehru did it’ / ‘Soldiers are dying’ / ‘The dynasty is evil’ / Hinduism is in danger’. Often, the state responds by arresting thevictimsin a bizarre mockery of impartiality.After barbarism such as Christchurch or Afrazul or Akhlaq, a nation needs to hear its leader’s condemnation loud and clear. But we don’t get this. Instead, we get carefully prepared dialogues and tweets that are promptly greeted with blood-curdling cheers from an online army of bots and devotees. What we need from our leader is heartfelt sorrow and angry censure; what we get instead is camera-ready tears and tele-prompted hype.Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark."

LS polls likely to be a tall order for Muraleedharan and Pradeepkumar
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Two Assembly members are battling it out in Kozhikode district to become Parliament members.A. Pradeep Kumar, who represents Kozhikode North in the Assembly, is now the LDF candidate for the Kozhikode Lok Sabha seat, while K. Muraleedharan, who represents Vattiyurkavu in Thiruvananthapuram district, is contesting from Vadakara.Though Vadakara comprises two Assembly segments in Kannur district — Thalassery and Koothuparamba — it is generally considered part of Kozhikode. Five other Assembly segments fall in Kozhikode district.And, this is not the first time legislators are running for Lok Sabha seats in Kozhikode. C.H. Mohammed Koya, former Chief Minister and Indian Union Muslim League leader, then an MLA representing Tanur, had contested the Lok Sabha election from Kozhikode in 1962. He had also contested for the Manjeri Lok Sabha seat when he was representing the Kondotty Assembly segment in 1973. Manjeri ceased to exist, but it had the Assembly segments, Beypore and Kunnamangalam, in Kozhikode district.What makes the fight interesting this time is that if A. Pradeep Kumar of the CPI(M) is trying to capture Kozhikode, Congress nominee K. Muraleedharan has been roped in to retain Vadakara. The Congress has been winning both the seats, which many believe are traditionally inclined towards the LDF.Whether the Congress will maintain its winning streak in the April 23 polls is another question. Campaigning in both Lok Sabha constituencies centres around different issues. If development is the focus in Kozhikode, political violence dominates the theme at Vadakara.Campaign managers feel the polls will be a tall order for both legislators. Mr. Pradeep Kumar is a familiar face in the urban segments of Kozhikode North and Kozhikode South.But Mr. Raghavan, who has been consecutively winning the Kozhikode Lok Sabha seat, is equally popular as well and also has a sway in the rural segments.In the case of Mr. Muraleedharan, who has been pitted against CPI(M)’s Kannur district secretary P. Jayarajan, he is not new to Kozhikode as he had represented the Lok Sabha constituency twice.While Mr. Muraleedharan has tasted defeats in Assembly polls, Mr. Jayarajan had won three times, including the Koothuparamba assembly bypoll.Incidentally, both the CPI(M) candidates also belong to the Lok Sabha constituencies they contest. But Mr. Raghavan, hailing from Kannur, has shifted his residence to Kozhikode after the polls in 2009. Mr. Muraleedharan also hails from Kozhikode though he shifted his political base to Thiruvananthapuram. According to Congressmen, Muraleedharan’s contest from Vadakara will revive the fortunes of the party in Malabar."
‘Election Commission regularly monitoring J&K situation’,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/election-commission-regularly-monitoring-jk-situation/article26603288.ece,"
CEC Sunil Arora clarifies on article in The Hindu
",,"In response to the article, ‘The case of the missing election in J&K — The failure to hold Assembly polls shows up problems in the working of the Election Commission’ (OpEd page, March 21), Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora writes:This is with reference to the write-up titled “The case of the missing election in J&K — The failure to hold Assembly polls shows up problems in the working of the Election Commission” written by Shri A.G. Noorani Ji, eminent Constitutional expert. In this context I would like to draw your kind attention to the following:While holding the press conference for announcing the schedule of the general elections to Lok Sabha and Assemblies of some States on 10.3.2019 at Vigyan Bhavan, the relevant paragraphs about J&K elections read as under:Review meetings“About holding election in Jammu and Kashmir, the Commission has been continuously assessing the prevailing situation in the State, requirement of Central forces and other logistics for elections, requirement of security for the candidates and preparedness of the State for the election on key factors. The Commission had conducted several rounds of review meetings with the MHA [Ministry of Home Affairs] and the State administration of Jammu and Kashmir.The State government of J&K and the Union Home Secretary had sent detailed and specific inputs to the Commission regarding holding elections in the State. To assess the situation and level of preparedness, the Commission had recently visited J&K and had detailed meeting with the political parties, all important Central and State Government agencies, with District Authorities and the Chief Secretary, DGP, Home Secy. and other officials in this matter.Based on the specific inputs and recommendation from the State Government and Union Home Secretary, inputs from the political parties and other stakeholders, constraints of availability of Central forces and other logistics, requirement of security forces for security of candidates in wake of incidents of violence in recent past and keeping other challenges in mind, the Commission has decided to announce only schedule of the Parliament elections in J&K.The Commission will be regularly and on real-time basis monitoring the situation in J&K and will also be taking inputs from all necessary quarters and decision regarding holding Legislative Assembly elections in J&K will be taken soon.Special observersA committee of three very eminent and senior officers has been set up as Special Observers to assess the situation in J&K. Shri Noor Mohammad, lAS (1977, Retd), Shri Vinod Zutshi, lAS (1982, Retd) and Shri A.S. Gill, IPS (1972, retd) have been appointed as Special Observers.Mr. A.S. Gill, a celebrated police officer, has wide experience of working in the field of security management. His special assignments have been of working as IG and DG, CRPF in Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. Noor Mohammad, retired as Secretary, Government of India and has worked in the field of election management for more than a decade. He has also been an international expert and consultant to Afghanistan for many years. He is currently working as senior consultant in the IIIDEM. Mr. Zutshi is a former Secretary, Government of India, and has worked as CEO Rajasthan and Deputy Election Commissioner in ECI for many years. He has long experience in the field of election management and continues to contribute to the Commission as national and international trainer.”The aforementioned paragraphs were a part of the Press Note, dated 10th March, 2019 about schedule of General Elections to Lok Sabha shared with the media and can also be read on the ECI website, www.eci.gov.in.The perusal of aforementioned paragraphs makes it clear that the Commission visited J&K after a series of wide-ranging consultations with Chief Secretary and senior officials of J&K starting with a video conference on 21.1.2019.Appointment processShri Noorani ji has also raised some pertinent points about the procedure of appointment of Election Commissioners and Chief Election Commissioner. All I would like to say in this regard is that this is strictly within the domain of Parliament and Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The Apex Court on 23.10.2018 have already referred this issue to a Constitutional Bench. Since the successive ECs and CECs including the present Commission including me have been appointed as per the extant laws, I have no further comments on this.Regarding the reference to my appointment having raised eyebrows, when I took over as CEC on 2.12.2018, in my opening statement after one or two prefatory remarks I said: All I can say is that I, my peers as well as my colleagues in Election Commission shall continue to put our best foot forward to meet the expectations of the stakeholders strictly in consonance and in conformity with the vision and ideals of the Constitution of India, especially the Preamble thereof."
CPI(M) resorting to lies: Murali,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-resorting-to-lies-murali/article26603719.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Congress leader K. Muraleedharan, who is contesting from the Vadakara Lok Sabha seat, has said that the CPI(M) leadership is resorting to ‘cheap propaganda’ as it smells defeat.He told reporters in Kozhikode on Thursday that the CPI(M) was resurrecting the false propaganda of a Congress-Indian Union Muslim League-BJP alliance, which was a three-decade-old lie, to divert the attention of people from real issues. The BJP and Sangh Parivar outfits had been training their guns on him ever since he contested from Vattiyurkavu Assembly constituency, and even after he won the seat, they had filed a case against him in the Supreme Court, he said.Claiming that several communist sympathisers and fellow-travellers had called him to contest the elections from Vadakara, Mr. Muraleedharan said this time the fight in the constituency would be between the ideology of democracy and the cult of violence. The Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) had already extended its support to the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Vadakara. Even today, the CPI (M) is annihilating its political opponents like slaughtering animals, he said.“So many families have lost their dear ones due to the political hostility. No proper inquiry was conducted in the politically motivated murder cases since the Left Democratic Front government came to power. The investigation into the killing of RMP leader T.P. Chandrasekharan case went smoothly only because the Congress-led UDF government was in power,” he said.Replying to questions, he said that the Indian Union Muslim League had requested the Congress leadership to nominate a strong candidate to take on CPI(M) leader P. Jayarajan at Vadakara when the party was delaying the selection of candidates. “When the party asked me to contest, I took up the challenge,” he said. The political fight in Kerala was between the Congress-led UDF and the CPI (M)-led LDF where the BJP had no space. The silent voter at Vadakara, which had seen enough bloodshed in the region, would seal the fate of the CPI(M) candidate, he said. Mr. Muraleedharan also claimed that the UDF would win 15 to 16 seats out of the 20 seats in the State. This was because the CPI(M), unlike the Congress which took all secular parties into confidence, had no political policy on its own. That party adopted one in Kerala, another in Tamil Nadu and a third one in West Bengal, he said."

A clutch of artists ruminate on existential issues facing us today in a curious mix of mediums
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A slice of life reverberates in Gallery Sumukha with nine artists from the city meditating upon a range of issues confronting us today. “Polygonal” probes, examines and critiques our lifestyle through the creations of Aishwaryan K, Deepti Jagannath, Hanoch Samuel, Lokesh BH, Pradeep GN, Prasad KV, Praveen B, Saleem Shoyab MS and Wahab SA.“I believe that any artwork should communicate and the works in this art show does just that,” says M Ramachandran, who has curated the show.The viewers are ushered into the show with Praveen’s conch-shell fashioned out of used plastic. After being over-fed with plastic in the sea, the conch shell has become oversized and transformed itself into what else, but plastic. The conch shell is seen as a symbol of life but in Praveen’s work it becomes a metaphor for our flawed lifestyle and government policies.Lokesh has done a mural installation — cow dung cakes with hoof marks on them, pasted on the wall. The work emphasises the agrarian life and its connection with nature.Ramachandran has chosen an interesting mix of artists for the show. Though all of them have art background, they do not practise art on a regular basis. “In fact, some of them are advertising and software professionals. During my visits to Bangalore, I met these artists and decided to do a show with them,” says the Kochi-based curator who is now working on the biography of KCS Paniker.Ramachandran would come down often to see and review the progress of the art works. “My only concern was not to make the works personal.”The videos, graphic novel, sculptural installations from wire mesh and image-based works reflect on existential issues that resonate with everyone. “The works makes us think: the existence, its past and the destination to which we are heading to. If a computer pixel is considered the most definite form, then it is quite strange because the pixel itself is hazy. Aishwaryan talks about this in his piece,” explains Ramachandran.Another highlight of the show is a video projection on a wall by Saleem. The wall has elements of Islamic architecture on which the artist projects images of violence accompanied by the sounds of the gun shots, bombs and other explosives.(The show is on at Gallery Sumukha, Wilson Garden till March 30)"

Going beyond gallery spaces, the rise of performance art indicates the changing relationship between the spectator and the artist
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A crossover genre with multiple influences, performance art continues to be intriguing, strange and full of surprises as it increasingly occupies more space in the arts arena in the country. Often immersive, amusing and rooted in radical acts, performance art is still considered relatively nascent in the Indian contemporary art scene. It eludes definition and sometimes baffles the public, leaving them wondering about what can really be called art. It also indicates the changing relationship between the spectator and the artist into a participative and interactive one, going beyond gallery spaces and seeking new venues.Challenging conventionsAt a recent event in Delhi, the first performance art work of Shalini Passi Art Foundation, curated by Arshiya Lokhandwala, was hosted at the home of the founder – Shalini Passi, over lunch. A gathering of guests waited and watched as the banner was switched on, declaring:Lunch is Cancelled. After a short while, accompanied by a band of servers, performance artist Mithu Sen marched out of the house, announcing instructions in gibberish. All were dressed in uniforms matched with a protective pet cone around the neck. The host’s pet, a black pug, was also part of the procession, elaborately adorned with ornaments and settled in a baby carriage. As an act of ‘radical hospitality’, the servers settled at the table and proceeded to feed themselves awkwardly through the cones, while the guests watched.“For me, it is important to poke and disturb conventional power structures in my performances,” reflects the artist, “the concept of radical hospitality exposes the relationship between the host and guests as one that is farcical and stems from the power dynamic at play.” Radical hospitality has emerged as a powerful trope in Sen’s work over the years. It initially sparked up as a theme at a residency in New York where she invited people to visit her while she was making art, put up the show in her apartment and disappeared on the opening day, squarely challenging the institution of hospitality and the artifice it involves.Sen’s works include paintings, performance art, and installations, exploring themes around social and cultural identities. Though an accomplished poet, Sen has chosen to use ‘non-language’ as a powerful and recurring tool in her performance works.The innate ambiguity of what has alternately been termed performance art, conceptual art and live art, is a characteristic feature of the genre. The absence of a specific structure and the ability to move across artistic medium has made performance art an open yet challenging experience to engage with. Moving away from structures of the visual art gallery, performance art has emerged as a radical practice of pain, protest, and politics in a post-studio scenario. “It is a medium where the artist can be critical of the art market and also elude it,” says Sen.On the other hand, unlike the narrative structures of drama and theatre, the unpredictability of performance largely lies in its aversion to script and rehearsal. Improvisation and participation emerge as pivotal elements leading a performance work. Renowned performance artist Inder Salim says, “Performance art is a term that keeps on revealing but does not tell us exactly what it is. It is open to different interpretations – constantly opening up to new possibilities and ideas. It is never a single, monochromatic brush stroke. Performance art can be seen as a haze, mixing different dust, through which we see a fraction; a state where we constantly confuse ourselves.”The artist adopted his performance pseudonym ‘Inder Salim’ to reflect a hybrid cultural identity. He uses the term ‘harkat’ for his performance art pieces. The term literally means ‘act’ or ‘escapade’. The artist’s interpretation focuses on the two cornerstones of performance art—play and politics.Moving the audiencePerformance art seeks to effectively transform the dynamics between the artist and the audience. From passive viewers in an art gallery or spectators in a theatre show, the audience become active participants or collaborators in most performance art works. The works are usually engaging, interactive, often meant to disturb people to come out of their comfort zones to think, act and explore their own mind.In a recent performance at the India Art Fair, artist Amol K Patil’s work challenged social discrimination. His performance involved street sweepers and other workers from Dalit communities. The artist says, “I chose to invite them because the people who do these jobs are mostly regarded as untouchable.” The participants blew soap bubbles in the open-air space, while the attendees mostly played with the bubbles without paying attention to the caste identities of the performers who were blowing the bubbles. “ The art world is not just for one particular class and should encourage diversity and tolerance.”The connections between theatre and performance art are finely balanced yet divergent. While both are anchored in the live presence of the performer, drama finds its source in a script while performance art negates the idea of a rehearsed narrative altogether. Drawn into this dilemma between the two genres, Patil recalls a period when he stopped performing for a while since he was torn about his approach to the work. For him, “theatre is about story-telling, while performance art is about creating situations.” Reflecting on the process of creating a performance art work he says, “I have a basic concept and structure in mind but I never practise or rehearse my performances. The body adapts itself into different public spaces and this has to be spontaneous, it cannot be determined earlier.”Most artists believe that the ‘realness’ of performance art works can address concerns about daily life issues that we often avoid talking about as a community. Nagpur-based Shweta Bhattad is known for taking up themes related to gender violence and abuse.Her performance art work series titledFaithwas staged at venues ranging from garbage dumps and iron mines to construction sites and in-the-air hoardings. Reflecting on her work on female foeticide she says, “I did this performance for each girl child who is murdered, dumped in landfills, drains, garbage and hence I decided to do this performance in a garbage space at Nagpur in a large clear bag full of air, which was in the form of chocolate wrapping to make the statement that the female body is not a product of sale like goods or entertainment. There is ‘faith’ that one-day people will change their perception of women and this world will become a better place for a woman to live freely, with all the respect, individuality and equality that a human being deserves.”In another work, she revisited the image of ‘Bharat Mata’ and addressed the issue of fear that resides in a woman’s body as she moves around the city. “We need to think about why women are still so scared in public spaces in cities and the causes of gender violence. As a woman, I feel this fear in my body and I want people to think about what it would take for an Indian woman to feel fearless and free on the streets.”The disruptive, dramatic and chronic state of confusion produced by performance art is creating new equations between the artists and viewers.The artistic explorations are led by a search for new idioms of expression that would question, challenge, and open up dialogues on politics, society, and culture.The concept of radical hospitality exposes the relationship between the host and guests as one that is farcical and stems from the power dynamic at play"

Seeks constitution of a panel to protect interests of victims
",,"The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday impleaded the Centre and State Commissions for Women and Children and Google, Facebook and Whatsapp in a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to regulate social media in the wake of increase in crimes against women and children.A Division Bench of Justices N.

The public interest litigation petition was filed byjallikattuactivist Karthikeya Sivasenapathy and advocate Karuppasamy Pandian.The petitioner complained that social media was being used as a platform to perpetrate violence against women and children. The violators used social media to entrap women and children in the guise of friendship. Even during investigation into the crimes, the victims were not provided any comfort, the petitioners said.The victims were put to mental stress, sometimes leading to their suicide. In order to protect the interests of the victims, the petitioner sought constitution of a commission comprising retired women judges, advocates and psychologists.The commission could receive complaints and information and investigate them. The commission could also sensitise the police to handle such cases. Further, gender-sensitive courts, regulation of social media and counselling for victims could be achieved through the commission."

Having won Best Feature at Big Sky Documentary Film Festival, ‘Pariah Dog’ is a poetic ode to the human heroes who work towards a safer future for native dogs ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A busy street in Kolkata buzzes with several scooters zipping back and forth on their daily commutes. What catches the eye, however, is a puppy, seeking direction, clearly terrified. But the puppy, injured and in pain, starts to cross the road, inch by inch, with no vehicles slowing down and no human bending to help. Does the terrified little one make it? This is one of the scenes inPariah Dog, a film by Jesse Alk and his team.Pariah Dogis not your traditional documentary, though some may categorise it as one. There’s no over-explaining and that’s what filmmaker New York-based Jesse Alk envisioned for film from the initial stages. Jesse comes from a unique breed of filmmakers which has helped shape his current filmmaking philosophy which he pegs as “experiential.”A still from ‘Pariah Dog’
 
| Photo Credit:Jesse AlkThe film follows three people in Kolkata who share their hopes and dreams for native dogs, often facing ostracism or potential violence while pursuing their mission. While the story is centred on Kolkata, one would still see pan-India references; the local protests against the native dog killings in Kerala being one.Seeing dogs pretty much everywhere struck a chord with Jesse who frequents India. The idea to do a film took root then and there; seeing it from the perspective as a visitor was one thing but approaching it as a filmmaker was something else. “These dogs have their little parallel society alongside humans, connected with ideas of ‘unseen’ or ‘ubiquitous.’ ... I knew what I wanted to do was a visual sensory thing of showing the animals with these people in this city. The intention didn’t include explaining any history. I try to get microscopic if possible.”Copious amounts of research went into the pre-production forPariah Dog, including countless conversations with many people in the native dog awareness communities. “There’s not a lot of context in the film intentionally, but I had to know all that context. I met with a lot of great people and because of those conversations, my understanding of the position of native dogs changed over time after seeing the ecosystems in which they live and how they relate to the city. As a Westerner, we can think ‘oh my goodness, all these dogs!’ and it takes a minute to understand that these aren’t stray dogs, they’re native Indian dogs.”A still from ‘Pariah Dog’

Koustav Sinha was my sound recordist while Rajib Kuila was my assistant camera. It was basically the three of us as crew but working as full collaborators. I needed their input very much because we’d bounce the ideas off each other and I needed to decipher everything. The sound was something we really thought about early on; I knew the sound of Kolkata wasn’t something I wanted to recreate in post. We ran microphones everywhere, often running one or two stereo mics at the same time. I did the sound work back here in the United States and Brian Rund was incredibly generous with his time make sure there wasn’t any inauthentic audio.”The film’s official poster by a Kolkata-based artist  
| Photo Credit:Upamanyu BhattacharyyaThe subject matter, being ever-developing and detailed, proved that packing the story into a single film was no small feat. “I could have made several films out of the material we collected. It was pretty difficult; I went through eight different versions of the film. I knew I wanted a poetic feeling of Kolkata and to have as many intimate moments with these human characters as I could. So when I focussed on that, unfortunately what had to go was a lot of dog footage and vignettes – the hardest and final cut.”With the sensitive subject matter, Jesse experienced moments of conflict – intervention versus documentation. “The most difficult moment is the crippled puppy crossing the road, and I didn’t know what the right answer was. But then you see this kid come pick up the puppy. It looks staged but it definitely wasn’t; the relief I felt was huge.”At one point Jesse wasn’t sure howPariah Dogwould be received but, in February, when the film showed at Big Sky Documentary Film Festival in Montana, it won Best Feature. “Some people found themselves covering their eyes at the more saddening parts, but I left those in intentionally, while the reactions were strongly positive. People connected with the characters; I was surprised people understood the thematics, that the film is about dogs but also about loneliness, making meaning in our lives and deeper existential things.”Jesse is currently in talks about film distribution with hopes that India as a main audience gets priority viewing.The crewJesse Alk:Producer/Director/CinematographerNoah Lerner:Co-ProducerAditi Sircar:Executive ProducerKoustav Sinha:Assistant Director/Sound Recordist/Co-WriterRajib Kuila:Assistant CameraBrian Rund:Sound Designer/Re-recording MixerJoe Miuccio:Sound EditorChad Smith:ColouristGraphics:NicefactoryFor more information visitpariahdogmovie.com"

Aijaz Khan and Rasika Dugal talk about making a film in a conflict zone
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Kashmir inhabits your being. All it takes is one visit or maybe, one film. Filmmaker Aijaz Khan and actor Rasika Dugal, sound overwhelmed, nervous and excited, as they talk about makingHamid.Hamidcomes at a crucial time in terms of the political situation and the ongoing discourse in the country. The Indian film industry’s contribution to conversations about Kashmir has been rather significant this year with the success ofUri. Amidst, the recent incidents of violence against Kashmiri traders and students in India and the perpetual strife that people live through in Kashmir, what would Khan and Dugal want a film likeHamidattempts to convey.The director of the film speaks about honesty and innocence that only children can have, and how that virtue is what theHamidis trying to convey. He says, “What media portrays of that place, what you hear about it is completely different from what you see when you land there.”One-line inspirationThe film is about a young boy, Hamid (Talha Arshad Reshi), who assumes that 786 is a direct phone line to Allah. When he calls the number, hoping to reach his untraceable father, a CRPF soldier posted in the State is on the other end instead.Hamidwas born out of a chance conversation between Khan and a friend from Srinagar. The latter talked about a play he saw the previous night, in which a boy dials 786 and gets connected to a Kashmiri Pandit. It was this single line which intrigued Khan enough to decide that the Mohammed Amin Bhat play had to be adapted into a film. The research that followed through several visits to Kashmir and conversations opened new boxes and doors. The director credits his writer Ravinder Randhawa for achieving this goal. “A one-line idea was given to him and he fleshed out these characters, details and their world,” says Khan. He shares how choosing the profession Hamid’s father as a boat-maker was an intentional one. “Boat-making is somehow a coastal imagery. It was the contrast that caught our eye,” says Khan while reminiscing about the locations that led them to the artisans who buildshikaras.Khan was clear from the beginning that he wanted to cast Dugal as Hamid’s mother. Says Dugal, “I told him, I think you should cast a Kashmiri actor because I was nervous about whether I would be able to do justice to this. I didn’t want to do injustice to the story of Kashmiri people because they’ve already been through too much. I felt that no matter how much I prepare, I will always be an outsider to that grief, to that story,” shares Dugal. It was Khan’s conviction that convinced Dugal to take on the role. Khan admires Dugal’s work to develop her character – a woman whose husband has vanished. “She came to Kashmir two weeks in advance to prepare for the role and get the accent right. It’s lovely to work with actors who come with more than 100%,” he says.An actor preparesSo how does an actor understand a character set in this context? “There is tons of material on Kashmir. I didn’t know which would be the one that would move beyond a political connection or even just an empathetic connection…,” says Dugal. The actor hoped her character Ishrat, at least, was able to truly inhabit that world. The research led Dugal to several books and documentaries and one that stood out most was Iffat Fatima’sWhere Have You Hidden My New Moon Crescent.The documentary features the activist and founder-chairperson of APDP (Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons), Parveena Ahanger. The film draws attention to disappearances in the State through Mughal Masi’s story, who eventually died after waiting 20 long years for her son to return. “Of all the material I read and accessed, this film really became my central piece.” says Dugal who highlights a moving moment in the documentary where Ahanger and Masi talk matter-of-factly about their missing children. “It’s the most chilling thing that I had seen. It moved me in a different way… I cannot put words to it and belittle that experience,” she says. Dugal went on to see several interviews by Ahanger, to find herself further surprised. “To have that kind of strength in spite of that kind of grief. Overcoming that grief and helping people who are in a similar situation is something that I still can’t wrap my head around,” she says about Ahanger.Perhaps this what cinema does to our lives. It brings us conversations outside of what we see through other platforms and stories. Dugal feels the same for hernew film, “I’m hoping thatHamidwill be that gentle conversation which I haven’t heard up till now,” she asserts.It’s lovely to work with actors who come with more than 100%Aijaz KhanDirector"

Illicit filming has been on the rise in South Korea

Its pop music industry is reeling from a scandal over a celebrity’s sharing of videos he took secretly while having sex.Police said the two men they had arrested, and two other people, had posed as motel guests to secretly install the cameras, obtained online from overseas, in 42 rooms at 30 establishments around the country since August.The footage from the cameras, hidden in television boxes, sockets and hair dryer holders, was broadcast live on a website, police said. “It was the first case we caught where videos were broadcast live online,” police said in a statement.More than 6,600 cases of illicit filming were reported to police last year, or about a fifth of all sexual abuse cases investigated, up from 3.6% in 2008, prosecutors have said. Last year, tens of thousands of women took to the streets of Seoul, the capital, to protest against illicit videos and other forms of sexual abuse and violence.The law was amended last November to toughen penalties not only for illegal filming but also distributing images without consent, which could bring jail terms of up to five years or fines of up to 30 million won.On Thursday, K-pop singer and television celebrity, Jung Joon-young, was arrested over accusations he shared his secret sex videos.. In a statement, he admitted all of the charges against him."

Chief Election Commissioner clarifies on article in ‘The Hindu’.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In response to the article,The case of the missing election in J&K — The failure to hold Assembly polls shows up problems in the working of the Election Commission(OpEd page, March 21), Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora writes:This is with reference to the write-up titled “The case of the missing election in J&K — The failure to hold Assembly polls shows up problems in the working of the Election Commission” written by Shri A.G. Nooraniji, eminent Constitutional expert. In this context I would like to draw your kind attention to the following:While holding the press conference for announcing the schedule of the general elections to Lok Sabha and Assemblies of some States on 10.3.2019 at Vigyan Bhavan, the relevant paragraphs about J&K elections read as under:Review meetings“About holding election in Jammu and Kashmir, the Commission has been continuously assessing the prevailing situation in the State, requirement of central forces and other logistics for elections, requirement of the security for the candidates and preparedness of the State for the election on key factors. The Commission had conducted several rounds of review meetings with MHA [Ministry of Home Affairs], State Administration of Jammu and Kashmir.The State government of J&K and the Union Home Secretary had sent detailed and specific inputs to the Commission regarding holding elections in the State. To assess the situation and level of preparedness, the Commission had recently visited J&K and had detailed meeting with the Political Parties, all important Central and State Government agencies, with District Authorities and the Chief Secretary, DGP, Home Secy. and other officials in this matter.Based on the specific inputs and recommendation from the State Government and Union Home Secretary, inputs from the Political Parties and other stakeholders, constraints of availability of central forces and other logistics, requirement of security forces for security of candidates in wake of incidents of violence in recent past and keeping other challenges in mind the Commission has decided to announce only schedule of the parliament elections in J&K.The Commission will be regularly and on real-time basis monitoring the situation in J&K and will also be taking inputs from all necessary quarters and decision regarding holding Legislative Assembly elections in J&Kwill be taken soon.Special observersA committee of three very eminent and senior officers has been set up as Special Observers to assess the situation in J&K. Shri Noor Mohammad, lAS (1977, Retd), Shri Vinod Zutshi, lAS (1982, Retd) and Shri A.S. Gill, IPS (1972, retd) have been appointed as Special Observers.Mr. A.S. Gill, a celebrated police officer has wide experience of working in the field of Security Management. His special assignments have been of working as IG and DG, CRPF in Jammu and Kashmir. Mr Noor Mohammad, retired as Secretary, Government of India and has worked in the field of Election Management for more than a decade. He has also been an international expert and consultant to Afghanistan for many years. He is currently working as Senior Consultant in the IIIDEM. Mr. Zutshi is a former Secretary, Government of India and has worked as CEO Rajasthan and Deputy Election Commissioner in ECI for many years. He has long experience in the field of election Management and continues to contribute to the Commission as National and International trainer.""The aforementioned paragraphs were a part of the Press Note, dated 10th March, 2019 about schedule of General Elections to Lok Sabha shared with the media and can also be read on the ECI website, www.eci.gov.in. The perusal of aforementioned paragraphs makes it clear that the Commission visited J&K after a series of wide ranging consultations with Chief Secretary and senior officials of J&K starting with a Video Conference on 21.1.2019.Appointment processShri Noorani ji has also raised some pertinent points about the procedure of appointment of Election Commissioners and Chief Election Commissioner. All I would like to say in this regard is that this is strictly within the domain of Parliament and Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The Apex Court on 23.10.2018 have already referred this issue to a Constitutional Bench. Since the successive ECs and CECs including the present Commission including me have been appointed as per the extant laws, I have no further comments on this.Regarding the reference to my appointment having raised eyebrows, when I took over as CEC on 2.12.2018, in my opening statement after one or two prefatory remarks I said: All I can say is that I, my peers as well as my colleagues in Election Commission shall continue to put our best foot forward to meet the expectations of the stakeholders strictly in consonance and in conformity with the vision and ideals of the Constitution of India, especially the Preamble thereof."
"Reality of impunity, rhetoric of human rights",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/reality-of-impunity-rhetoric-of-human-rights/article26593693.ece,"
Isolated innovations are not enough to stop cases of custodial torture ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In May 2017, addressing representatives from countries at the UN’s Human Rights Council, the then Attorney General of India said, “The concept of torture is completely alien to our culture and it has no place in the governance of the nation.”Last week in Sitamarhi district, Bihar, two families received the bodies of their two sons from the police. The two men were questioned at the Dumra police station for a case of theft and murder in the area. Instead, they came back dead. The ritual bathing revealed torture — tell-tale marks of nails hammered into their thighs and wrists.A common story in IndiaBetween the rhetoric of Geneva and the reality at Dumra lies the all too frequent story, in India, of police torture. We are rightly cautioned to call it ‘alleged murder’ until proven in court. But the story we come across is too common for us to suspend belief.More than a week has passed. The motions of taking action have begun but there are clear signs of routine impunity. Top police officials in Bihar have recognised that the custodial deaths were “unacceptable”. There were some transfers and the policemen who were implicated were suspended and had a criminal case filed against them. A First Information Report has been registered. But in the first instance, the policemen who were implicated were not named. They were arrested and taken into custody but escaped, allegedly with the help of local police. They remain untraceable.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is content giving the Bihar Police six weeks to explain its conduct. A plea from several concerned civil society representatives urging the immediate despatch of an NHRC team to Sitamarhi has been turned down. For now, it’s wait and watch.What statistics showThat torture is ‘endemic’ across police stations in India is well known. Official statistics show that last year there were 144 deaths in police custody. About 40% of complaints received every year by the NHRC are against the police — mainly for custodial violence.Though forbidden by law, the system perpetuates and incentivises torture. Top police officials tolerate it, turn a blind eye to it, citing it as a ‘practical tool’, or go easy on the perpetrators; Bihar will be a space to watch. Those in the lower judiciary, which is the first point of check against custodial violence, are frequently not vigilant in checking if arrested persons are secure in custody, have a lawyer assigned, or have the means to speak out.Often, pliant doctors further weaken protections to those in custody by willingly minimising or not disclosing the nature of the harm or injuries they have sustained. Oversight bodies like police complaints authorities and human rights commissions are comfortable with the slow pace of accountability from state actors and do no doggedly pursue outcomes.The brazenness is strengthened when legal precedents towards torture prevention are not paid heed to. South Asia is among the last regions where the political executive must grant permission before public servants can be prosecuted for acts done in the course of their work. Courts have repeatedly said that torture is no part of policing and so there is no question of waiting for permission for prosecution. Yet, the executive is still asked, decisions are delayed, and trials cannot proceed.According to judicial precedent, recovery of evidence made as a result of torture cannot be used in court, but without proactive lawyers and magistrates, these important details are overlooked in the early stages of the legal process. For victims of torture, this means a harder fight in courts.Besides being illegal and immoral, torture is not even a useful tool to stop crime. Eliciting unreliable confessions — the bedrock of the use of torture — destroys the process of deciding through evidence-based means whether the accused is the real perpetrator or not. Moreover, whenever it goes unpunished, torture actually supports more crime by creating a class of criminals within law enforcement. You cannot have a cohort of torturers masquerading as officers of the law while they destroy it.Feeble course correctionThere have been attempts to restrain the use of torture. The Kerala Police Act puts the onus on all police officers to report any physical torture they know of. Prisons in Telangana refuse to admit people brought into judicial custody if they appear injured; such persons are sent back to hospitals, forcing their injuries to be properly recorded.But isolated innovations are not enough to stop this horror that has embedded itself in the subculture of policing. A comprehensive solution would be to ensure that disincentives are put in place and that there is proper accountability. But there is a lack of political will.India signed the UN Convention against Torture in 1997, but despite repeated domestic and international recommendations to ratify it, there has been no attempt to create a specific and comprehensive torture prevention law. This is in sharp contrast with Bangladesh, which passed a strong law in 2013. Until we have such a law, Indians must accept that the active tolerance of torture puts punishment before the crime and judgment in the hands of the wrong agency. This violates the rule of law in every way.For those who now plead on behalf of the police personnel of Sitamahri and say “let the law take its course”, this is absolutely right. Let the effort to establish guilt or innocence be thorough and speedy. Sadly, for Mohammad Gufran, 30, and Mohammad Taslim, 35, their guilt or innocence will never be known after their death that day in Dumra police station. It is all so very far from the resplendent halls of the UN in Geneva and the averments of India’s highest law officer.Maja Daruwala is Senior Adviser, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI).

Why is it so? Because, what is at stake is the very future of the secular democratic republic, as enshrined in our constitution,” he wrote in the latest edition of the party’s mouthpiecePeople’s Democracy.‘Many betrayals’Mr. Yechury, in an editorial, said that the government could be judged on “the balance sheet of its betrayals alone”. He said the Constitutional guarantees were in danger because “institutions have been assaulted by the Modi government”.The primary task before India’s electorate is to ensure the defeat of the Modi government and give a mandate for the establishment of an alternative secular democratic government, Mr. Yechury said.He accused the Modi government of playing divisive politics, seeking to establish a “Hindu Rashtra”. “The sharpening of communal polarisation has created a pervasive atmosphere of hate and violence throughout the country,” he wrote."

Muraleedharan into the electoral scene, the Vadakara Lok Sabha constituency has become a prestigious battleground for both the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Malabar.After its initial indecision, the Congress chose Mr. Muraleedharan, the Vattiyoorkavu MLA, to take on former CPI(M) Kannur district secretary P. Jayarajan, who had launched his campaign even before the Election Commission announced the poll dates.The candidature of Mr. Muraleedharan has set the tone for a political fight between the Congress and the CPI(M) in the constituency spread across Kannur (Thalassery and Koothuparamba Assembly segments) and Kozhikdoe (Vadakara, Nadapuram, Kuttiyadi, Koyilandy and Perambra segments) districts.His selection has not only counterbalanced the groupism in the Congress party, but also galvanised activists of the UDF, especially the Indian Union Muslim League which has sizeable presence in the hilly regions of the constituency.The former KPCC president, who plans to launch his campaign from Vadakara on Thursday, termed his nomination as a fight against the politics of violence. The Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP), which holds sway in the some grama panchayats in Vadakara taluk, has extended support to the candidate.The Congress, which won the Vadakara seat in 2009 and 2014, has been struggling to find a suitable candidate after sitting MP Mullappally Ramachandran decided to opt out of the race following his elevation as KPCC president.Poll issuesWhile issues such as the Kasturirangan report, communal disharmony and political violence dominated the electioneering in 2014, UDF poll managers say they will focus on the issue of political violence this time.LJD factorHowever, the switching over of the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) to the LDF camp is another factor in the election. Though the party has been denied a seat, the district unit has decided to throw their weight behind the CPI(M) in the race."

Women find their feet at Sri Krishna Kattaikuttu Kuzhu near Kanchipuram
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The open sky. Stars are twinkling even as tube lights illuminate just the square where the koothu is taking place. It is 11.30 p.m., when the act begins. The entire village has had dinner and brought their mats to sit and watch ‘Saidavan Garvabhangam’ Kattaikuttu by Sri Krishna Kattaikuttu Kuzhu.First, the formalities. Every leader of the village must be honoured. Then the melam begins its prayer to the five Gods of learning and auspiciousness and play all the prescribed talas (rhythm units). What is interesting is that all the actors are standing behind the musicians in their ordinary clothing and playing the cymbals or singing as chorus. As the entry of the character they are playing nears, they hand over the cymbals to someone else and go backstage to put on make up and costume. There are always at least eight people behind the musicians to sing along, so the audience misses nothing. The speciality of Sri Krishna Kattaikuttu Kuzhu is that even a petite girl with a thin voice like Prabhavathi can lead the singing and reach high octaves. She can also play male roles. Prabhavathi, who trained to be a nurse has decided to be a full-time koothu artiste and use her nursing training to help the villagers.Sri Krishna Kattaikuttu Kuzhu was founded four years ago. Thilagavathi Palani became the youngest and the first woman to be a part-owner of a koothu group and the group prides itself on its young performers, who are also students in different colleges and schools. Some of the actors are graduates of Kattaikuttu Gurukulam of Punjarasanthangal and some are drop outs from there. The group is now performing almost 200 all-night shows in a year. They began performing the episodes from the Mahabharata they knew initially, but two years ago Thilagavathi took a sabbatical from the group for a year to work with Mandaiveliamman Koothu group to learn more plays and expand their repertoire.A new play they worked on was ‘Aravan Kalabali.’ The group worked for three months, learnt the dialogue and songs and performed the play full of pathos. ‘Saindavan Garvabhangam’ is a new play of the group. The story of Saindhavan or Jayatratha, who had kidnapped Draupadi and how he gets humiliated for his action provides enough space for plenty of humour and heroic scenes. Green Kumar as Saindhavan and KYC Murthy as Dharmaraja and Thilagavathi as Duchala stole the show.Koothu does not have a static microphone bound stand-and-deliver theatricality. It requires that the audience knows the play and can critique if the expectations are not met right then and there. There is an acute sense of habitation of the story in the audience and the actors beyond space and time. The clown narrators in Kattiakkarans (there were two in this play) with their humour show us that the secret is in laughter. They develop an intimacy, which is communicated to the audience. The grandiosity of the Kattai Vesham costumes and movements are matched by the bonhomie and heartiness of the Kattiakkarans, who are brimming with frenetic, inventive and whimsical energy.Just 25, Thilagavathi Palani has built a small space at Kalavai Kootroad village. This will be used for Koothu workshops, for village kids to come and study, host inspirational talks and also for young people of the village to be trained in the Koothu theatre form after school hours. This Dalit girl, who comes from a poor family, is doing it all from her own earnings as a professional koothu artiste.Thilagavathi has proved that determination, hard work and sincerity of purpose will win over all opposition. She remains unmarried — after convincing her parents — to be a travelling professional koothu artiste doing even male roles in all-night performances and educate her younger sisters.She says that one must go on with one’s work, whatever people might say. “They will get bored and look for something else to talk about when they see you are sincere in your work,” says Thilagavathi. “We must enter the grand space of this amazing form to succumb to it and create our own thinking, feeling, autonomous world. Working with an inspiring artiste like Sangeeta Isvaran and keeping an eye open for the many strands and making them available to my group is both enjoyable and energising. Access to this wealth of experiences impacts all our lives,” says Thilagavathi.The two women have looked at ways to foreground these strands, embellish hidden connectives, indulge in emphasising parody, and with a great generosity of spirit, peddle it with humour captivating the audience with its multi-dimensionality.Sangeeta IsvaranSangeeta Isvaran’s unique artistic vision“Some talk with eyes and a face sweet and bright, but me I converse with the wind in the night”Sangeeta Isvaran dances in a solid, flesh and blood human way. She uses her dance in a lonely desperation to make her art be relevant with social issues with no half measures or whispering or compromises. She uses the energy of her art bubbling over with enthusiasm to communicate something sublimely important like gender equality.In Sangeeta Isvaran’s world, the classical and folk are not two different entities but require the same persistence and earthly passion. She does not think that the hallowed performing spaces of Chennai sabha circles are any holier than the village earth open to the sky. This brilliant mathematics graduate from Madras Christian College, who learnt Bharatanatyam and Carnatic Music at Abhinayasudha run of Kalanidhi Narayanan decided to make her dance a tool for social activism. I remember the long talks we used to have when I taught dance theory to her three decades ago, that dance is not just for performance. After Sangeet Natak Academy’s Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar and travels around the world be it working in war zones in Indonesia, in the deep Amazon forests of South America or with sex workers in Cambodia, Sangeeta continues to amaze everyone with her striking artistic personality and her original ideas for using the arts for social and health issues.‘Lorry Lolakku’ was an idea born out of a necessity to tell different kinds of stories that are not generally told. Sangeeta founded ‘Wind Dancers’ and began the first year of her Katradi experiments to tell the stories of kuppams to clear misunderstandings about them. She went to the different kuppams and collected stories of how they came to be, what identities they have for themselves and told these to others through her collaborative theatre and dance. Every year she picked up one theme and worked on it.This year Sangeeta and her colleague Liz Haynes decided to look at gender. Sangeeta wrote a comic book in Tamil, called “Vetri” on women super heroes. It reached to over 40,000 children. She then decided to produce it as a performance with Bharatanatyam, Carnatic music and Therukoothu/Kattaikuttu as complementary forms. She roped in Sri Krishna Kattaikuttu Kuzhu of Kanchipuram, decided to get a lorry as a stage and perform in unlikely places like Kuppams and village crossroads.“The tagline for Vetri is that the smallest lamp can light up the darkest abyss. dispel the deepest darkness. Everyone has a light and that needs to shine. Gender stereotypes are so limiting and children make terrible choices devoid of mentoring. Girls get married off at the age of sixteen for fear of males lurking around. They are not given any choice by their families.”At a women’s college in rural Arcot, girls were embarrassed with the theme of menstruation and marriage in the beginning but went backstage and hugged Sangeeta and Thilagavathi after the show. Sangeeta has also started a programme called job readiness for girls looking at strategies to deal with the issues. Domestic violence comes down when the woman has worked even for two years. because the girl knows she can stand on her own two legs.“The Power of arts cannot be denied,” says Sangeeta. “The Koothu songs on these issues have an amazing aural ear wormness quality. We found several kids humming the songs long after the shows. It makes us happy that they are even thinking about it. I know that this is just a drop in the ocean. But this work is precious for me. The kind of affection we are given in the rural areas is unbelievable. Taking Bharatanatyam to the children kids in a small village and Koothu to cities is very satisfying. One can become a person of power if one has the will wills with confidence to deal with situations. Making eye contact with children and treating them as equals produces so much power. This is magic for me.”"

CDS survey exposes worrisome trend
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A study report brought out by the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) has thrown up a worrisome trend of normalisation of ‘joint stalking’ of women through local young men’s WhatsApp groups.These groups were found to help teenage males to attain the macho image necessary for patriarchal self-assertion, and ‘managing’ young women in their vicinity has emerged as one of their activities.The survey ‘Walking on Eggshells in Cyberspace: A Report on Gender Justice, Law Enforcement, and Women’s Struggles and Negotiations in Malayali Cyberspace’ was prepared by J. Devika, Chithira Vijayakumar, Darshana Sreedhar Mini, Resmi P.S., and Elizabeth Alexander as part of a research project coordinated by IT for Change, Bengaluru, and supported by the Web Foundation.“What seems evident is that young men do not realize that ‘checking out’ random women by sending them continuous messages constitutes harassment; instead they consider this part of ‘being male,” the report said.Drawing on the experience of a male student who was stamped a “sex trafficker” on account of his protests against normalised misogyny in young male groups eventually leading to his expulsion from the family, the researchers concluded that attacks against dissenting men too can be highly gendered.Call for supportWomen seeking to find a public voice through social media find it an uphill climb, especially because of mass attacks by cyber trolls. Securing online voices by women seems to call for strong offline support, of a political party, or pre-amassed social and cultural capital.“Given the strongly patriarchal nature of most political parties in Kerala, there is reason to believe that these voices are more likely than not to be submissive to, or echoing of, the patriarchal leadership to some degree at least,” said the report.The survey painted a dismal image of college authorities in their response to the Gender Based Cyber Violence Against Women stating that they were reluctant to complain for fear of ‘bad name’ and cited this as evidence for the extent to which institutions mandated with producing the liberal subject and the active citizen are in real terms still shaped by highly gendered and discriminatory familial discourses of honour.Distressingly, most of the students surveyed didn’t even know of the Internal Complaints Committee as a very large number of them asked for ‘friendly committees’ and ‘staff committees.’ While 89% of the respondents didn’t approach college authorities after being harassed online, nearly 75% cited lack of trust as the reason."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Filmmaker Richie Mehta was at first reluctant to make Netflix's latest series, documenting the aftermath of the notorious gang rape and murder of a Delhi student that made global headlines.A 23-year-old physiotherapy student, was violently raped and assaulted and left for dead by five men and a teenager on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012.The horrific crime shone an international spotlight on India's high levels of sexual violence, and sparked weeks of protests and eventually a change in the law to introduce the death penalty for rape.“Initially I was against the idea. I thought it was inappropriate for anyone to do it,” the Indian-Canadian director toldAFPduring an interview in Mumbai.“But after I read the verdict and met some of the officers involved, I was amazed. The verdict detailed the manhunt and who these people were and how they were found.“I realised that this analysis of hunting these guys is also a way of understanding why these things happen,” he added.Delhi Crime, a seven-part series written and directed by Mr. Mehta, will be released on Netflix worldwide on Friday.The thriller recreates the police investigation, tracing the pursuit of the six men behind the shocking crime.Four of the adults accused received death sentences, while one died in prison by a suspected suicide. The teenager was released after three years in a youth detention home.Mr. Mehta said Delhi's police commissioner at the time of the atrocity, Neeraj Kumar, had first suggested to him that the investigation would make a powerful film.The filmmaker disagreed at the outset. But gradually he changed his mind and went on to spend four years interviewing police officials involved in the case.'Too painful'It is their perspective on the case that he tells.“When the crime happened, there was a lot of anger pointed toward this institution. But when I got to know their point of view I realised the police were trying their best, especially given the statistics.“As we say at the start of the show: '11,000 heinous crimes are reported every year (in Delhi). Prevention is nearly impossible with half the police force stuck on traffic duty and VIP protection',” he added.The series, filmed in English and Hindi, was well received at its premier at the Sundance Film Festival this year.It stars Shefali Shah (Monsoon Wedding) as the lead investigating officer, and also features actors Adil Hussain (Life of Piand Denzil Smith (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel).Nearly 40,000 rape cases were reported in India in 2016.But activists say that is just the tip of the iceberg, with many victims too scared to come forward.Politicians and religious leaders initially blamed physiotherapy student for inciting her own murder, echoing prevailing attitudes in India where rape victims face overwhelming prejudice.Even one of the perpetrators blamed her, saying women who went out late at night attracted men.The authorities banned the broadcast of aBBCdocumentary by British film-maker Leslee Udwin calledIndia's Daughterbased on the victim in 2015, saying they would not allow anyone to use the incident for commercial purposes.Mr. Mehta said he spoke to the victim’s family to assure them their daughter's horrific murder would not be depicted in the drama.But her father said the series would still open too many old wounds.“We will not watch it because it will be too painful,” the victim’s father toldAFP.“Of course we can't ever forget what happened to our daughter but we don't want to be taken through the horror all over again. The pain will be too much to bear for my family.”"

Left-Congress split may polarise Bengal,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/left-congress-split-may-polarise-bengal/article26593508.ece,"
Trinamool, BJP expected to gain votes
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"West Bengal was gearing up for a three-cornered election with the Trinamool Congress, the BJP and the Left-Congress alliance competing for votes. With the collapse of the seat-sharing arrangement between the Left and the Congress, the contest is now a four-cornered battle, putting the Left and the Congress at a disadvantage.The split is likely to result in a sharp polarisation benefiting the Trinamool Congress and the BJP.Voting trendIn the past elections, the Left Front’s vote share — even at a time when they lost miserably in the Assembly election in 2011 — was high. To the Trinamool’s 38.93%, the Left Front got 39.68% of the votes polled. However, between 2011 and 2016, the Left’s share dropped by 14%, whereas the Trinamool Congress’s went up by 6% and the Congress’s by about 3%. In the Lok Sabha election of 2014 too, the Left Front failed to reach a vote share of 30%.The BJP’s vote share went up from a mere 4% in the 2011 Assembly election to 10% in 2016. The pattern indicates that the Left’s loss is the BJP’s gain.A further reduction in the Left’s vote, which is likely after the split, will only help the BJP, observers says. But not entirely.“A large section of Muslims are not very happy with the Trinamool. But, will they vote for the Congress and the Left Front knowing that they now have almost no chance of winning many seats after their split? I don’t think they will. Majority of them may now vote for the Trinamool, as no other party is in a position to resist the BJP,” said Abdul Matin, a faculty member in International Relations at Jadavpur University.Thus, in three Muslim-majority districts of central Bengal, where the Trinamool is weak, the ruling party is expected to do well. But in the Hindu- majority areas, the BJP is expected to gain. “Due to this break-up of the Congress and the Left, in Hindu areas, where the incumbency factor is setting in after a decade of Trinamool rule, the BJP will gain,” a Trinamool party source said.Party linesMaidul Islam, a political scientist, said, “In Bengal, the voting behaviour is not always on communal grounds. Rather it is on party lines because of the politically conscious electorate. So the lack of an electoral adjustment between the Left and Congress is going to benefit the Trinamool for consolidating the anti-BJP vote. On the other hand, the anti-Trinamool vote can go the BJP where the Left is weak.”Maidul Islam, a political scientist, says “The split will make the middle platform recede faster, fuelling a perception that two parties represent two communities, which is not good for the State and the country.” Two parties representing two communities “in a watertight manner is potentially dangerous”, he added.This phenomenon is particularly expected in pockets of some bordering districts, where Dalit community [who came from Bangladesh] are “enamoured by Narendra Modi’s rhetoric on citizenship and in areas where Bengali-speaking population is low,” the TMC insider said. He further added, on condition of anonymity, Left-Congress’ split will “hurt the social fabric as BJP will now have a better chance to divide the State on a Hindu-Muslim line.”Maidul Islam, a political scientist, says “There was already a perception that Hindus who are leaving the CPI(M) and Congress are voting for the BJP and Muslims [leaving CPI-M and Congress] for the TMC…the [Left-Congress] split will make the middle platform recede faster, fuelling a perception that two political parties represent two communities, which is not good for the State and the country,” Dr Islam said. Two parties representing two communities “in a watertight manner is potentially dangerous.”“With the weakening of the third force [Left-Congress] in the State, this can effectively turn political violence to communal ones, perhaps benefiting TMC in the short run and BJP in the long term,” Dr Islam said.The short-term benefit TMC was visible in the recent by-elections. In a 2018 by-poll in Uluberia Lok Sabha seat, TMC and BJP’s vote jointly jumped by a massive 25% while Congress and Left’s share dropped by 24%. Series of other recent Assembly by-polls that witnessed four-cornered contest produced near similar results.As of now, TMC is still protected, especially in south where 75% of Bengal’s seats are located.However, if the slide continues, TMC will be facing “very serious challenge” in 2021 Assembly poll, the party leaders acknowledge.For now, however, both TMC and the BJP are set to gain owing to a formal divorce of the Left and the Congress."

In that case, the CPI(M) was no different from the BJP, he alleged.‘A joke’IUML national general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty said the Left Democratic Front would be decimated in the Lok Sabha elections. The Communist parties had no role in the battle between the politics of hatred practised by the Modi government and the secular forces led by the Congress-led coalition in the country. The claim of the CPI(M) that it protected minorities was a joke, he said. Mr.Kunhalikutty said the replacement for Mr. Raghavan was Mr. Raghavan himself. The candidature of P.

Muraleedharan into the electoral scene, the Vadakara Lok Sabha constituency has become a prestigious battleground for both the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Malabar.After its initial indecision, the Congress chose Mr. Muraleedharan, the Vattiyoorkavu MLA, to take on former CPI(M) Kannur district secretary P. Jayarajan, who had launched his campaign even before the poll dates were announced. The candidature of Mr. Muraleedharan has set the tone for a political fight between the Congress and the CPI(M) in the constituency spread across Kannur (Thalassery and Koothuparamba Assembly segments) and Kozhikdoe (Vadakara, Nadapuram, Kuttiyadi, Koyilandy and Perambra segments) districts.His selection has not only counterbalanced the groupism in the Congress party, but also galvanised activists of the UDF, especially the Indian Union Muslim League which has sizeable presence in the hilly regions.The former KPCC president, who plans to launch his campaign from Vadakara on Thursday, termed his nomination as a fight against the politics of violence. The Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP), which holds sway in some grama panchayats, has extended support to the candidate. The Congress, which won the Vadakara seat in 2009 and 2014, has been struggling to find a suitable candidate after sitting MP Mullappally Ramachandran decided to opt out of the race following his elevation as KPCC president.Political violenceWhile the Kasturirangan report and communal and political violence dominated the electioneering in 2014, UDF poll managers say they will focus on the issue of political violence this time.However, the switching over of the Loktantrik Janata Dal to the LDF camp is another factor in the polls. Though the party has been denied a seat, the district unit has decided to throw their weight behind the CPI(M) in the race."

Ramachandran and later Jayalalithaa of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) — for over 40 years, Tamil Nadu is going into a major election on April 18 for the first time without a towering figure.This has triggered talk that the upcoming Lok Sabha poll may turn out to be a tame affair.But, the situation does not appear to be so, as there will be byelection to 18 Assembly constituencies which will take place simultaneously. The outcome of the bypoll will decide the fate of the AIADMK government led by Edappadi K. Palaniswami. In the present strength of 214 members in the Assembly that has 21 vacant seats, the government is surviving by a margin of 17 members over the DMK-led front.Naturally, the State’s principal political forces, the DMK and the AIADMK, are leaving no stone unturned to come up trumps. After putting in considerable efforts, they have stitched up alliances of diverse parties and gone out of the way in accommodating their allies in allocation of seats.Conscious that voters of the State do notice whether the major players have included the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in their alliances or not, the two Dravidian majors have ensured the inclusion of the national parties. This was in stark contrast to the 2014 situation when the DMK and the AIADMK chose to ignore the national parties. But, then, Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa were there at the helm of the two parties.This time, the two parties are fielding their core members in an equal number of constituencies — 20, even though they are allowing a few of their allies to use symbols of their parties in some constituencies. And what has not gone unnoticed is that the current elections are going to be an acid test, both for the DMK’s M.K. Stalin and AIADMK’s Edappadi Palaniswami and O. Panneerselvam, as they are under pressure to prove their mettle. Should they put up a poor show, there is a possibility of a breakout of power struggle inside their organisations. However, for the common man, the elections present an opportunity to make his or her choice, depending upon a number of factors such as social, political, local and livelihood issues.Caste equationIn the predominantly rural Harur Assembly seat (where a bypoll will be held) of the Dharmapuri parliamentary constituency in the western region where there has been a history of tense equations between the intermediary Vanniyars and Scheduled Castes, caste appears to hold sway. Scars left behind by the organised violence against the SCs in a few villages in November 2012, falling under the neighbouring Pappireddipatti Assembly segment, are yet to heal. Interestingly, Pappireddipatti too is facing a bypoll.If the alliance between the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and the AIADMK factors in their cadre base, it may also mean losing out on the AIADMK’s significant Dalit voter base, given the perception among sections of the Dalits in Harur that the PMK represents essentially the interests of the Vanniyars. This election, the average AIADMK Dalit voter may shift his loyalty.Cuddalore is another area where the ruling party’s alliance with the PMK plus the BJP has disturbed many a section. Needless to say, that is not the only issue. Sections of voters in this district, known for an intricate demographic mosaic of Vanniyars, Dalits, fishermen and minorities, have a long list of grievances against the AIADMK regime over a range of issues.K. Vallathan, a fisherman of Devanampattinam, one of the largest coastal hamlets in the State, recalls with a sense of hurt that at the time of the Gaja cyclone in November last year, “no one from the ruling dispensation even bothered to visit us. The community is only used as a vote bank and the political leaders forget us after the election.” To make matters worse for the AIADMK, there are signs of lack of cohesion within the party.Caste alone does not decide everything in the Thanjavur parliamentary constituency, known as the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu. Mukkulathors or Thevars, a social coalition of three sub-castes – Kallars, Maravars and Agamudiayars, constitute the major section of society. Yet, “it all depends on the contesting candidates,” says Palani of Peravurani in Thanjavur. The Maravars and the Agamudaiyars live in equal numbers and are known for their allegiance to the two different Dravidian parties. But when it comes to elections, individual profile of the candidate becomes the governing factor.V.R. Muthu Peyandi, a marginal farmer from Pullaneri village in the Madurai constituency of southern Tamil Nadu, captures the mood of agriculturists in his village. Shortage of money circulation since demonetisation and the introduction of a Rs. 6,000-a-year scheme in lieu of durable efforts to increase the income of farmers have caused him dissatisfaction against the Centre. Yet, “we are yet to decide whether we need a change,” Muthu Peyandi says.DhinakaranAbout 150 km further south lies Tirunelveli, where the factor of the AIADMK’s rebel and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK)’s founder, T.T.V. Dhinakaran, has become all pervasive. Almost every youth from the Mukkolathor community seems to be a vociferous Dhinakaran supporter.According to the youth, the rebel alone can provide the “much-needed political space” to their community.The situation is perceptibly different in the western region’s Coimbatore, once famous as the centre of textiles in southern India, where people are more concerned about economic aspects than others. Infrastructure development, closure of power loom units, unemployment, the apparently sagging economy and the efficacy of Ayushman Bharat, a health insurance scheme of the Central government, are among the issues that are bothering the people there with no clear tilt, as yet, in favour or against any major political formation.Having achieved stunning success in the only byelection (R.K. Nagar Assembly constituency in December 2017) held in the State since Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, Mr. Dhinakaran, as a third force, is widely expected to cut into AIADMK votes across constituencies. But, he does not seem to be content with that. He has begun assiduously wooing Muslims, who account for 5.86% of the State’s population and have been favouring the DMK generally. He has allotted the Central Chennai Lok Sabha seat to the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). Though the DMK has also not named any Muslim nominee, its ally, the Indian Union Muslim League, will put up one in Ramanathapuram. As of now, there is no Muslim contestant from the AIADMK-led front.The presence of the nascent Makkal Needhi Maiam, a party floated by veteran film actor Kamal Hassan, may also upset the calculations of the principal players in some constituencies.Given the poll arithmetic and the Dhinakaran factor, the DMK-led front appears to be enjoying an edge over the AIADMK’s “mega alliance.” But, one should also not forget that Tamil Nadu, known for giving decisive verdicts, has sprung a surprise even on seasoned pollsters on more than one occasion in the past 20 years.(With additional inputs from S.

Why Facebook didn't block live video of New Zealand shooting,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-facebook-didnt-block-live-new-zealand-shooting-video/article26587710.ece,"
None of the 200 or so people who watched the live video flagged it to moderators
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Why did Facebook air live video of the New Zealand mosque shooting for 17 minutes? Didn’t anyone alert the company while it was happening?Facebook says no. According to its deputy general counsel, Chris Sonderby, none of the 200 or so people who watched the live video flagged it to moderators. In a Tuesday blog post, Mr. Sonderby said the first user report didn’t come until 12 minutes after the broadcast ended.All of which raises additional questions among them, why so many people watched without saying anything, whether Facebook relies too much on outsiders and machines to report trouble, and whether users and law enforcement officials even know how to reach Facebook with concerns about what they’re seeing on the service.“When we see things through our phones, we imagine that they are like a television show,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia. “They are at a distance, and we have no power.”Facebook said it removed the video “within minutes” of being notified by New Zealand police. But since then, Facebook and other social media companies have had to contend with copies posted by others.Also ReadErdogan airs New Zealand attack video at campaign rallyThe shooting suspect carefully modelled his attack for an internet age, as he live-streamed the killing of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.Tim Cigelske, who teaches about social media at Marquette University in Milwaukee, said that while viewers have the same moral obligations to help as a bystander does in the physical world, people don’t necessarily know what to do.“It’s like calling 911 in an emergency,” he said. “We had to train people and make it easy for them. You have to train people in a new way if you see an emergency happening not in person but online.”Reporting live videoTo report live video, a user must know to click on a small set of three gray dots on the right side of the post. A user who clicks on “report live video” gets a choice of objectionable content types to select from, including violence, bullying and harassment. Users are also told to contact law enforcement if someone is in immediate danger.Also ReadNew Zealand mosque shooting: Controversial Australian lawmaker “egged” after commentsFacebook also doesn’t appear to post any public information instructing law enforcement how to report dangerous or criminal video. The company does have a page titled “information for law enforcement authorities”, but it merely outlines procedures for making legal requests for user account records. Facebook didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment and questions about its communications with police.Facebook uses artificial intelligence to detect objectionable material, while relying on the public to flag content that violates its standards. Those reports are then sent to human reviewers, the company said in a November video.The video also outlined how it uses “computer vision” to detect 97% of graphic violence before anyone reports it. However, it’s less clear how these systems apply to Facebook’s live streaming.Unique challengesExperts say live video poses unique challenges, and complaints about live streaming suicides, murders and beatings regularly come up. Nonetheless, they say Facebook cannot deflect responsibility.Also ReadNew Zealand cabinet agrees on tougher gun laws in ‘principle’“If they cannot handle the responsibility, then it’s their fault for continuing to provide that service,” said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami.She calls it “incredibly offensive and inappropriate” to pin responsibility on users subjected to traumatic video.In some cases, it’s not clear at the outset whether a video or other post violates Facebook’s standards, especially on a service with a range of languages and cultural norms. Indecision didn’t seem to be the case here, though. Facebook simply didn’t know about it in time.2.3 billion usersFacebook’s Mr. Sonderby said in March 19 blog post that the company “designated both shootings as terror attacks, meaning that any praise, support and representation of the events” are violations.Also ReadSuspect had run-ins with the Dutch police: mediaProfessor Vaidhyanathan said Facebook’s live video feature has turned into a beast that Facebook can do little about “short of flipping the switch.” Though Facebook has hired more moderators to supplement its machine detection and user reports, “you cannot hire enough people” to police a service with 2.3 billion users.“People will always find new ways to express hatred and instigate violence,” he said.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern expressed frustration that the footage remained online four days after the massacre.Banned videos repostedMachines can detect when users try to repost banned videos by matching patterns, or digital fingerprints, in the files. But users determined to get around these checks can make small alterations, such as tweaking the colour or the video speed.The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a group of global internet companies led by Facebook, YouTube, Microsoft and Twitter, said it has identified 800 different versions and added them to a shared database used to block violent terrorist images and videos.Mr. Sonderby said some variants are tough to detect and that Facebook has “expanded to additional detection systems including the use of audio technology.”In a series of tweets a day after the shootings, Facebook’s former chief security officer, Alex Stamos, laid out the challenge for tech companies as they raced to keep up with new versions of the video.“What you are seeing on the major platforms is the water leaking around thousands of fingers poked in a dam,” he said.Mr. Stamos estimated the big tech companies are blocking more than 99% of the videos from being uploaded, “which is not enough to make it impossible to find.”"

Says alliance with LJD brightens LDF prospects
",,"The fielding of K. Muraleedharan by the Congress will not impact the victory chances of LDF nominee P. Jayarajan in Vadakara, CPI(M) Kozhikode district secretary P. Mohanan and party Central Committee member Elamaram Karim claimed on Tuesday .They told the media that the nomination of Mr. Muraleedharan posed no threat to the CPI(M). Mr. Karim pointed out that Mr. Muraleedharan had tasted defeat in various Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.Reacting to Mr. Muraleedhran’s reported remarks that his fight was against political violence, Mr. Karim referred to the alleged role of K. Sudhakaran, the Congress candidate in Kannur, in many incidents of violence in Malabar.On the support extended by the Revolutionary Marxist Party ( RMP) to the UDF candidate in Vadakara, he said that this “local outfit” had been doing this for a long time as was evident in the grama panchayats at Chorode, Eramala, Azhiyur, and Onchiyam. The CPI(M) leaders claimed their party nominees would easily sail through in the Kozhikode and Vadakara seats as the sitting MPs, M.K. Raghavan and Mullappally Ramachandran, had no achievements to their credit.Mr. Mohanan said the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front had won hands down in the Assembly segments in Kozhikode district in the 2011 and 2016 polls. But for various reasons the CPI(M) lost the Lok Sabha polls in 2009 and 2014.Now with the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) joining the Left coalition the CPI(M) would have better chances of winning the elections from Kozhikode and Vadakara. The LJD had a significant presence in Kozhikode district that would help the LDF gain more votes, Mr. Karim said.He also accused the Congress sitting MPs of adopting a soft stand towards the Sangh Parivar agenda of Hindutva. Only the CPI(M) could take on the communal politics of the BJP, he claimed."

At a joint press conference on Tuesday after concluding the first Pakistan-China foreign ministerial dialogue, visiting Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that the world should make a “new assessment” of the situation in Kashmir, especially after the Pulwama attack.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Pakistan on Tuesday pressed China to focus on alleged human rights violations in Kashmir as Beijing prepares to play an active diplomatic role in defusing Indo-Pak tensions following last month’s Pulwama terror attack.At a joint press conference on Tuesday after concluding the first Pakistan-China foreign ministerial dialogue, visiting Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that the world should make a “new assessment” of the situation in Kashmir, especially after the Pulwama attack.Mr. Qureshi asserted that he had briefed his Chinese counterpart and state councilor Wang Yi about “the rapidly deteriorating situation on the Indian side of the Kashmir,” especially the “human rights violations” following the Pulwama suicide bombing, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.“This is a concern because that leads to a reaction, and that reaction at times creates tension in the region, which must be avoided,” he said, referring to Islamabad’s position that violence in Kashmir has indigenous roots, and is not the result of cross-border terrorism.India, on its part has been engaged in lobbying world capitals against radiation of terrorism from Pakistan, especially after the Pakistan based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed took responsibility for the Pulwama attack.“I think there is a need for a new assessment of how the situation on the Indian side of Kashmir should be handled by the Indians. There are voices within India that are questioning the efficacy of the policy that they [Indians] have followed for the last many years now,” Pakistan’s top diplomat said.But during the press conference, Mr. Wang made no direct or indirect references to the Kashmir issue, though he praised Pakistan for exercising restraint to de-escalate the post-Pulwama situation.Instead, the Chinese side reinforced its stated position that Beijing firmly upheld the maintenance of status quo along the borders — a stance it had adopted on February 27, after sections of the establishment in Islamabad raised the alarm apprehending Indian missile strikes on Pakistani targets.“No matter how things change in the world and the region, China will firmly support Pakistan in upholding its independence and territorial integrity and dignity…,” Mr. Wang said.“The purpose and principles of the UN charter and international norms must be observed in earnest,” he added.The Chinese foreign minister stressed that “a peaceful and stable South Asia is in the common interest of regional countries and meets the expectations of the world. China commends the constructive effortstaken by Pakistan to ease the situation. We call Pakistan and India to exercise restraint and peacefully resolve their differences.”On the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Mr. Wang said that Beijing and Islamabad will “take strong measures to insure a safe and secure environment for CPEC,” and “step up counterterrorism cooperation”.Mr. Wang elevated Pakistan’s role in promoting an “Afghan owned and Afghan led inclusive reconciliation process,” and invited the Afghan Taliban to join the talks. “We commend the important role played by Pakistan in this process and its unique role in this process,” the Chinese foreign minister observed.“Our two sides will strengthen the China Afghanistan Pakistan trilateral foreign ministers dialogue mechanism, fully tap its potential and engage more exchanges and cooperation with Afghanistan,” Mr. Wang said."

Jayarajan, strongman of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), in Kannur in the coming Lok Sabha election.They are likely to contest from the Vadakara constituency in north Kerala.Setting the stage for a sharply bipolar and highly charged electoral battle in a political turf that witnessed internecine strife between the Congress, the BJP and the CPI(M) workers recently, Mr. Muraleedharan said democracy would defeat the abhorrent subculture of political violence institutionalised by the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the State.""I am ready to give a strong fight now that the party has asked me to do so. It does not matter who my opponent is. Only the ideological alignment of the candidates' matter. The Congress strongly condemns the use of assassination as a political tool to eliminate dissenters. That is going to be the central plank of the electoral battle against the CPI(M) in Vadakara"", he said.Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee(KPCC) president Mullapally Ramachandran told reporters in New Delhi that he had broached Mr. Muraleedharan's name with senior party leaders and the party president was scheduled to announce his decision soon.Incriminated in political killingsMr. Ramachandran attempted to typecast Mr. Jayarajan as the archetype of the ''brutal politics of annihilation practised by the CPI(M)'' in Kerala. He claimed that the CPI(M) in Vadakara was opposed to Jayarajan's candidature because of his violent past.CPI(M) Leader P.

Mr. Jayarajan has protested his innocence and slammed both accusations as politically motivated ones and that they would have no bearing on the general election.Mr. Jayarajan represented Koothuparamba as its MLA in 2001 and 2006. He served as the Kannur district secretary of the party since 2010 till stepping down to fight the Lok Sabha election from Vadakara. He is known for his strong grass roots level association with party workers and left fellow travellers.Support of RMPMr. Muraleedharan, in contrast, brings to the polls his strength as an adroit politician who was elected thrice to the Lok Sabha from Kozhikode in 1989, 1991 and 1999. He has strong political roots in Vadakara, and had served as KPCC president between 2001 and 2004.The Congress has reckoned that Mr. Muraleedharan stood a good chance of trouncing Mr. Jayarajan owing to the support of the Revolutionary Marxist Party(RMP).K. K. Rema, wife of slain RMP leader T. P. Chandrasekharan, has stated that her party would campaign against Mr. Jayarajan and his brand of ""violent politics"" with the support of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Vadakara. The RMP has accused the CPI(M) of orchestrating Chandrasekharan's murder in 2012 in retaliation for his defection from the party to form the RMP.The BJP is reportedly set to field V.K.

Stage set for straight fight in Vadakara
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Congress high command on Tuesday named former Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president and Vattiyoorkavu MLA K. Muraleedharan for the Vadakkara constituency, ending the uncertainty during the last few days over the selection of candidates for the remaining four of the 16 seats that the party will contest in the April 23 Lok Sabha elections.Mr. Muraleedharan’s entry into the fray has virtually changed the complexion of the electoral fight for the Congress party, making Vadakara the centre of attraction this time.Mr. Muraleedharan’s candidature has helped the party neutralise the possible negative impact of faction struggles witnessed in the nomination of T. Siddiqque for the Wayanad seat. The stage has been virtually set for a direct fight between the United Democratic Front and the Left Democratic Front in the State.Selecting a candidate for Vadakara became a challenge for the Congress leadership especially after KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran stuck to his stand to keep off electoral politics. Malabar leaders expressed their apprehension at the overall impact on the region if the Congress party failed to field a strong candidate against CPI(M) leader P. Jayarajan, who has been a bete noire for the party.By roping in Mr. Muraleedharan, Mr. Chennithala has succeeded in making up for the factional setback had he received when he had to give in to Oommen Chandy’s pressure for the Wayanad seat. Overall, the Chandy faction has got several prime seats, including Chalakudy, Wayanad and Idukki. The Chennithala faction has got seats that would be tight, but it could still pull off a victory in the backdrop of the Vadakara “formula” it is now experimenting.Mr. Muraleedharan, reacting to mediapersons questions, said he was not concerned about who his opponent was. For him, the contest was between secular democratic forces and perpetrators of the cult of political, he said.Having represented Kozhikode Lok Sabha seat earlier, Mr. Muraleedharan would find it much easier to navigate the peculiar social, religious and political dynamics that work in Malabar constituencies. He has always pitched himself on the side of secular democratic forces even when he was in political wilderness for some time, making him acceptable to various social groups.Congress leaders, even those who were once Mr. Muraleedharan’s arch enemies, say that his presence in the fray will have a positive impact on other constituencies will be benefited and enable the party to confront the CPI(M) on the issue of political violence.The Vadakara contest also affords an opportunity for Mr. Murleedharan to replant himself in Malabar politics, which was his domain once."

Widespread violence, commercialisation of health and education and selfishness in general had been accepted as the norm. Besides, anyone who spoke for the environment was dubbed as anti-development conspirator, he said.Mr. Jayakumar said that Gandhism had the key to most of our problems at a time when all Gods had failed; it is only that Gandhi’s views needed to be interpreted in a way suitable to the time."

It was not immediately clear who were behind the attacks.Authorities increased security in the region after the violence, he said.Voting was held in Rangamati to elect local government officials, but some candidates boycotted, citing irregularities.Several armed tribal groups are still active in the district, which shares borders with India and Myanmar. The district is famous for lakes, forested hills and tribal life, and thousands of tourists, mostly Bangladeshi, visit each year.While a 1997 peace treaty between the government and armed tribal group Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti, ended an insurgency allegedly backed by India, the region remained chaotic because of other groups that live on extortion and control of government contracts.

Thereafter, the government has tried to make this a khaki election, a national security-based election, Mr. Tharoor told PTI in an interview.They are trying to hype their nationalist message that they were trying to protect the nation at the time of danger which, to my mind and my party’s view, has not been the principle challenge facing the country,” said the former diplomat and author who is aiming for a hattrick from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat this time.In his view, a daily terror of hunger, poverty and disease strikes the hearts of millions of India and the government must deal with that too.“I am not minimising national security, but I am saying that the election has to be fought on perennial issues and not on a tragedy of one moment. That tragedy will be dealt with, has been dealt with and should be dealt with.“But there is a daily tragedy, the daily terror of hunger, poverty, disease that is also a terror that strikes the hearts of millions of our fellow Indians and that too needs to be dealt with by the government,” he said.Agreeing that some surveys have suggested the BJP’s chances have improved after the terror strike, Mr. Tharoor said it was the job of his party to remind people of the real issues.According to the Thiruvananthapuram MP, there has been a dramatic change in the character of India under BJP rule.An estimated 97 per cent of all communal violent incidents relating to cow vigilantism have happened in last four years, Tharoor said.And those are figures issued by the Home Ministry of Rajnath Singh. Not by Congress, not by any NGO. These are government figures. These are very serious crises,” he said.Lashing out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said “triumphant majoritarianism celebrates violence” and the “prime minister stays silent”.So the condoning of this kind of thing is a deep assault on the very foundations of our democracy,” the former Union minister said.He said there are attempts by the centre to undermine the Constitutional arrangement that India was a country for all religions.“That’s being undermined in the ruling party’s language and rhetoric and is also undermined by steps like the citizenship amendment Bill which will allow every citizen of a neighbouring country except Muslims to settle here. That kind of bigotry was never part of Indian nationhood,” he said.Tharoor also expressed the hope that the people of India will vote out the BJP as the party doesn’t deserve a second chance.Addressing the issue of farmer distress, he said, “Sadly, more farmers are committing suicide than there are victims of terrorism in India. I am not saying we should minimise... we should also keep our country safe, but we want the people to address the existing real problems which includes major levels of agrarian distress. For the first time in history, we have eight farmer suicides in Kerala.”The former UN diplomat also mocked the claims of the BJP government over job creation and said the saffron party was only interested in keeping its own job in Delhi.The Congress wants every person in India to have a job, he said.Due to the failed employment policies of the BJP government, skill development has not taken off effectively in the last five “wasted” years, Tharoor said, alleging that the exports and manufacturing sectors had taken a beating.“Thanks to demonetisation, not only the GDP growth got hit of 2 per cent, but small and micro enterprises have shut down across the country.Asked whether the Congress was ready to take on the BJP, he said it was “absolutely” ready.Common people, the Congress leader said, were suffering under NDA rule.An LPG cooking gas cylinder, which cost Rs 390 under the UPA regime, was priced Rs 975 under the BJP government for no good reason, he said.Excise duties for petrol have gone up to Rs 19.48 under BJP rule even when the world prices are dropping, he added.

Deputy Speaker says he is ready to accept any punishment if found guilty
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Insisting that his family is prepared for any probe in connection with the Pollachi sexual abuse case, Tamil Nadu Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman has reiterated his charge that the DMK is politicising the issue.“Just look at the sequence of events in the whole issue. It is clear that it is the DMK’s agenda. The party president M.K. Stalin and former Minister K. Ponmudy have said that this case will be beneficial for the DMK in the elections,” he toldThe Hindu.“I was the first person who said that the case can be investigated by the CB-CID, the CBI. If our family is found guilty, my family and I are ready to stand before the public and accept any punishment they give us,” he said.Charge against mediaStating that he had helped the affected girl lodge a police complaint when they were traumatised, he accused the media of trying to portray him as a culprit.“Has anyone asked for proof fromNakkheeranGopal (editor ofNakkheeran) or Stalin or Kanimozhi, who are fanning the controversy, about the involvement of the AIADMK? Mr. Gopal has put out photos of my sons declaring that they were involved and that they should be shot. Isn’t he inciting violence? How will the girl’s family feel about this [videos leaked byNakkheeran],” he asked. Mr. Jayaraman questioned why no Opposition leader, especially Ms. Kanimozhi, visited and supported the affected girl. “The Opposition will run away from the issue after the Lok Sabha elections. But I will remain with her family. I am still insisting that all those affected should come forward and lodge complaints,” he said.The police, according to him, arrested the key accused Thirunavukkarasu only after Pollachi AIADMK MP Mahendran and “my son submitted a representation to the police.” The girl and her brother have said “I supported them but the media blacked out even her lawyer’s statements.”As for expelled AIADMK functionary ‘Bar’ Nagarajan’s role in assaulting the girl’s brother, Mr. Jayaraman countered, “Everyone is talking about him but why is no one speaking about the first accused Senthil, who is a close friend of the son of a local DMK leader.”"
A prayer for our times,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-prayer-for-our-times/article26572299.ece,"
Unsound judgments and faulty moral reasoning are not the lot of leaders alone — but also of those who support them ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"As all of us ordinary citizens recovered from the carnage in Pulwama, and wondered how the government would respond to this latest instance of cross-border terrorism, one television channel showed us poignant images of grieving relatives of the fallen soldiers. While a few, driven by moral hatred for the perpetrators, were understandably crying for revenge, others, even at this moment of utmost suffering, spoke of the futility of retaliation. “It would only bring similar suffering to fellow humans,” said one widow from the rural hinterland. Hers was a cry for peace, not for vengeful violence. “War can only be the last resort, after everything else has failed,” she wisely counselled.War and patriotismYes, war is sometimes necessary, especially in self-defence. But one doesn’t have to be an unconditional pacifist to acknowledge the misfortunes it begets or to decry war mongering. Nor is readiness to go to war the only indicator of patriotism. True, patriots must be prepared to die in defence of their ‘patria’, their mother or fatherland. But one is not any less a patriot if one strives for everyone in his country living peacefully, happily, flourishing, leading life to its fullness. Fighting the daily challenges faced by their countrymen, seeking to improve their lot, always loving them and their habitat, and expressing this love in word or deed as the occasion demands is the everyday vocation of a patriot.A country at war is different. War is disruptive, and because it is lethal and involves human sacrifice, a patriot must eschew any bravado about it. This is particularly expected from contemporary leaders, patriots who never themselves go to war; quite unlike the past where the ruler who declared war was expected to always lead from the front on the battlefield. After all, it is our Army officers and jawans who die, not the ones who call for and support war. Our rulers move about with elaborate security to protect their own lives. If they don’t allow others to play with their lives, they must ensure that no one plays with the life of their countrymen, most of all our soldiers. Decisions on war must then be taken responsibly, without haste, not for spectacular effect or as tactical ploys in a game.The inner workings of the human mind are mysterious, however. For it is not these thoughts that crossed my mind when I saw those moving images on television. This reasoning is retrospective; thoughts that have occurred to me now, post-facto. At that time, a strange melange of emotions — feelings of grief, despair, shame, nostalgia — curdled up and then suddenly, from nowhere, the lyrics of an immortal song by Sahir Ludhianvi, set to tune by Jaidev and sung melodiously by Lata Mangeshkar in the 1961 Dev Anand classicHum Dono, came unbidden to mind: “Maangon ka sindoor na chhutey, maa behenon ki aas naa tootey(may no one be widowed; may no mother or sister lose hope of their loved one returning).”Prayer for peace and wisdomIn the film, these lines are part of a prayer for peace led by the wife and mother of a Major of the Indian Army missing in action — a prayer not only that their own loved one returns home safe but that no wife, mother or sister may lose loved ones in war. Death in war is an interruption, an anomaly. It takes away from us young, active, lively persons who have not yet lived their full life. When a soldier dies in the prime of life, he leaves many tasks unfinished, many relationships incomplete, millions of desires unfulfilled. And according to popular belief, when a person at the height of his powers meets a bloody, violent, untimely end, hispranaoratmanremains in limbo, trapped in no man’s land; it leaves the body without reaching wherever it is meant to go and keeps hovering around us. May this never happen to anyone, says the poet. “Deh bina bhatke na praan(may the spirit not abruptly detach from the body and wander restlessly).”But this mellifluous song is more than a comforting prayer for peace. It subtly points fingers at those who injudiciously push us into war, at the economically strong and politically powerful who bring war upon us for their own benefit, to serve their own nefarious purpose. “O saare jag ke rakhawaale, nirbal ko bal dene waale, balwaanon ko de de gyaan (jnana)(you, who watch over the entire universe, you who empower the weak, may you also grant wisdom to the mighty).”Jnanahere refers not simply to knowledge, but to wisdom, moral insight, indeed to conscience. May the rulers rule with a conscience! May they be able to distinguish right conduct from wrong. Really, only such people should guide us when we are faced with the dilemma of whether or not to undertake morally retributive action.And this is not all. The prayer then becomes a plea that we all be endowed withsanmati— to put our intelligence to good use, to have sound judgments, that all have a conscience. Why? Because unsound judgments, faulty moral reasoning and suspension of good sense are not the lot of leaders alone but also of those who support them and legitimise their actions. It is after all we, ordinary folks, who are swayed by war hysteria. Those without good sense get the leaders they deserve. May the gift ofsanmatibe bestowed on us. For only people withsanmatican rein in leaders who have lost all sense of good and bad, right and wrong.A civilisational anchorBut who is this prayer addressed to? “Allahtero naam, Ishwar tero naam(You, whose name is both Allah and Ishwar). In this, his masterstroke, Sahir invokes not only Gandhi, but an entire, centuries-old religio-philosophical legacy of the subcontinent in which all traditions are believed to share the same semantic universe that enables the god of one religion to be translated into the god of another. This is inclusive monotheism at its best, where god is one but referred to in different traditions by different names. And so, the prayer is addressed to Allah, Ishwar, and implicitly to the god of every religion.With men spewing venom, not satisfied with fighting a war with their own fellow countrymen, itching to go to war with others, nothing (empathy, reason, dialogue) seems to work. Helpless spectators, no longer in control of their collective life, in sight of a looming disaster on the horizon, often break into a prayer. What else can those stripped of agency do but hope that somehow good sense may prevail, that all of us be delivered from the collective insanity that shows no sign of loosening its grip? Thus, those who believe in one god, invoke him; those who believe in gods and goddesses, invoke them; and those who believe in neither, hope for some good fortune to fall in their lap! This is why this is a prayer for our times: we offer this prayer to you, Allah to some, Ishwar to others, that you miraculously bring an end to needless killings, wisdom and conscience to the rich and powerful, and peace and good sense to everyone.Rajeev Bhargava is Professor, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi"
Tram shooting in Dutch city Utrecht: police arrest Turkish suspect,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dutch-police-arrest-turkish-man-suspected-of-killing-three-in-tram-shooting/article26575809.ece,"
Three people were killed in the incident that occured on Monday. ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Police have arrested a Turkish man suspected of shooting dead three people and wounding five on a tram in the Dutch city of Utrecht on Monday.Police said 37-year-old Gokmen Tanis had been taken into custody after an hours-long manhunt. He had had earlier run-ins with the authorities in the Netherlands.The city was put into lockdown after the shooting, shortly after the morning rush hour, which the authorities initially said was an apparent terrorist attack. Police conducted raids in several locations after issuing an image of Tanis and warning the public not to approach him.But hours after the shooting, the gunman's motive remained unclear. A prosecutor said it could be for “family reasons” and Turkey's state-runAnadolunews agency, quoting relatives of the gunman, said he had fired at a relative on the tram and then shot at others who tried to help her.Also ReadSuspect had run-ins with the Dutch police: mediaThe Turkish intelligence agency said it was investigating whether the attack was personally motivated or an act of terrorism, President Tayyip Erdogan said.Earlier, on Wednesday, the authorities had raised the terrorism threat in Utrecht province to its highest level; schools were told to shut their doors and paramilitary police increased security at airports, other vital infrastructure and at mosques.The threat level was reduced by one notch to where it had been after the suspect was arrested, the National Counter-Terrorism Agency said.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte convened crisis talks immediately after the incident, which came three days after a lone gunman killed 50 people in mass shootings at two mosques in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand.“Our country has today been shocked by an attack in Utrecht... A terrorist motive cannot be excluded,” Mr. Rutte said. “The first reports have led to disbelief and disgust. Innocent people have been struck by violence.”The Mayor of Utrecht, Jan van Zanen, said three people had been killed and five injured, three of them critically.Criminal recordThe suspect had previously been arrested, regional prosecutor Rutger Jeuken told reporters, without giving further details.Also ReadGunman kills 3 on Dutch tram; Mayor suspects terror motiveThe shooting took place in Kanaleneiland, a quiet residential district on the outskirts of Utrecht with a large immigrant population.“It's frightening that something like this can happen so close to home,” said Omar Rahhou, who said his parents lived on a street cordoned off by police. “These things normally happen far away but this brings it very close, awful.”Witness Daan Molenaar, who said he had been sitting at the front of the tram when the shooting started, told national broadcaster NOS he did not believe it was a terrorist attack.“The first thing I thought was, this is some kind of revenge or something, or somebody who's really mad and grabbed a pistol,” he said.Utrecht, the Netherlands' fourth largest city with a population of around 3,40,000, is known for its picturesque canals and large student population. Gun killings are rare in Utrecht, as elsewhere in the Netherlands."
U.S. human rights report flags curbs on Indian media,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-human-rights-report-flags-curbs-on-indian-media/article26583665.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Thecountry Human Rights reports for 2018were released last week as part of an annual exercise in which the U.S. State Department submits its assessment of such rights as per the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international agreements to the U.S. Congress.The2018 India reportcovers a range of issues including press and media freedoms, forced disappearances, custodial deaths and the NGO clampdown — which became an issue between the U.S. and India, after the NDA government cancelled licenses of some 15,000 NGOs under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act.In 2016, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had taken up the issue of the Christian charity, Compassion International, with Minister for External Affairs Sushma Swaraj.“The government imposed restrictions on foreign funding of some nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including those with views the government stated were not in the ‘national interest’, thereby curtailing the work of these NGO,” the report said.In terms of custodial deaths, the Report cites official (Indian) figures of 1,674 cases of such death between August 2017 and February 2018, with 1,530 occurring in judicial custody and 144 in police custody.The report, in a separate section, Role of the Police and Security Apparatus , says, “Police continue to be underpaid, overworked, and subject to political pressure, in some cases contributing to corruption.”Regarding data from the Home Ministry in response to an RTI request on the 2016 NGO Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative report regarding human rights violations committed under the AFSPA (the report said just under half of the cases reported were from Jammu and Kashmir in the 2012-2016 period), the State Department report says, “The data supplied by the Ministry of Home Affairs under the Right to Information Act did not indicate, however, whether complaints were deemed to have merit.”Civilian deathsThe report also cites figures from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on alleged violation of human rights by security forces in Kashmir. It says 130-145 civilian deaths by security forces in Jammu & Kashmir occurred between June 2016 and April 2018.The report however also adds that, “Non-governmental forces, including organized insurgents and terrorists, committed numerous killings and bombings in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the northeastern States, and Maoist-affected areas.”“Maoists in Jharkhand and Bihar continued to attack security forces and key infrastructure facilities such as roads, railways, and communication towers,” it said.Taking note of undertrials, the report, based on National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) data, says just over 2,93,000 individuals were awaiting trial at the end of 2016. It also cites a 2017 Amnesty International report saying that Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis comprised a disproportionate number (53%) of pre-trial detainees,Press attackedRegarding press freedom and the safety of journalists, the report says , “There were numerous instances of journalists and members of media being threatened or killed in response to their reporting. Police rarely identified suspects involved in the killing of journalists.” It cites a 2017 Press Council of India report saying at least 80 journalists were killed since 1990 but only one conviction had occurred thus far.In terms of editorial freedoms, the report says, “The Editors Guild of India claimed the government limited press freedom by exerting political pressure and blocking television transmissions.” It cited the firing ofThe Tribune’sEditor-in-Chief Harish Khare after reported government pressure on the newspaper following its report on privacy and security flaws in the Aadhaar program.The report quotes the 2018 World Press Freedom Index as saying online trolling and attacks on journalists was a major issue. “With Hindu nationalists trying to purge all manifestations of ‘anti-national’ thought from the national debate, self-censorship is growing in the mainstream media and journalists are increasingly the targets of online smear campaigns by the most radical nationalists, who vilify and even threaten physical reprisals,” the report said.The report draws particular attention to the trolling of women, saying, “Online and mobile harassment was especially prevalent…journalists were threatened with violence and, in the case of female journalists, rape.”The government also made an increasing number of requests for data from internet companies as per the report. 22,024 requests were made in 2017, according to Facebook data, a 61.7% rise from 2016.SurveillanceThe Central Monitoring System (CMS) of the government, could, without informing the subject or a judge, monitor electronic communication in real time, the report says."

At an election debate, they question parties’ ‘duplicity’ and ‘hollow promises’

At least, this is the impression generated at an election debate organised by Pathanamthitta Press Club, in which a cross-section of new voters and youth wing leaders of various parties took part.A group of students from the Pathanamthitta Catholicate College and from the Mannam Memorial NSS College at Konni, along with P.B. Satheeshkumar, Democratic Youth Federation of India district secretary; Aneesh Varikkannamala, Youth Congress State general secretary; and Vishnu Mohan, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha district president, participated in the debate.A good number of new voters saw a “duplicity being pursued by various parties while vocally supporting secularism and then adopting caste and religion as the key criterion in candidate selection.”Campus violenceA few said t they could never accept violence on campuses and in public places in the name of politics. “Violence, killings, clashes, and the hartals that follow make the common people treat politics contemptuously. The incidents have created a sort of disgust towards politicians,” they said.A degree student from Catholicate College took strong exception to the “practice of political parties giving hollow promises to the public during election campaigning and in the poll manifesto.”“Though I am for ousting the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, on what grounds shall I vote for the Left parties who will support the Congress after the election,” asked Sandeep from Catholicate College.Rejo from the same college alleged that the election promises made by parties had been proved hollow and the people had lost faith in them. The student community at large criticised the violence, instigated by certain political parties, on college campuses, he said. Abhijith from NSS College said certain qualifications should be set for politicians too.Youth leaders unitedMeanwhile, the leaders of all the three mainstream youth organisations, DYFI, Youth Congress, and BJYM, were united in countering the criticisms against politics and politicians.They stated in one voice that violence had no place in politics and their organisations never supported it. The leaders said they could not agree with the arguments raised by the new voters against politics."

The United Democratic Front (UDF) is sure to highlight political violence during the campaigning.After a rousing reception given to him by the UDF workers at the Kasaragod railway station and at the District Congress Committee (DCC) office on Monday morning, Mr. Unnithan went straight to Kallyot to lay wreaths at the spot where the youths were cremated near the place where they were hacked to death by alleged Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers.“The entire party machinery in the district is now poised to work for the victory of Mr. Unnithan,” said DCC president Hakkim Kunnil.

Many thought that young party leader B. Subbayya Rai, who has Kannadiga background, would be the Congress candidate. A section of the Congress leaders even blamed the DCC president after the announcement of the candidate on March 16. “I am confident of winning as the people of Kasaragod are outraged by the murders of Kripesh and Sarath Lal,” said Mr. Unnithan. He said he had gone to Bandadka and Cheemeni from Kallyot to “pay homage to those killed by the CPI(M) in the past.”The 63-year-old Congress leader, a familiar face for voters because of his appearance on TV channels as the Congress spokesman in the State, will secure votes of people who are angry over the twin murders and the government’s handling of the Sabarimala issue, among others, local leaders of the party say."

Vadakara proves a tough call for Cong.

Siddique for the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat.Yet, selecting a candidate for Vadakara turned out to be a challenge, especially in the context of the strong presence of Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidate P. Jayarajan and the kind of electoral fight that is shaping up for the seat.Mr. Siddique’s name was cleared but only after factionalism touched a new low. Mr. Chandy had thrown his weight behind Mr. Siddique at the Congress Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting on Saturday and returned home before the meeting concluded.Four seatsThe CEC referred the decision on four seats — Wayanad, Vadakara, Attingal and Alappuzha — to Congress president Rahul Gandhi for a final resolution.On Monday, the factional tussle continued behind the scenes with Mr. Chandy refusing to budge.The Congress president reportedly asked the Kerala leaders to arrive at a consensus. Subsequently, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala acceded to Mr. Chandy’s pressure since he felt he had a higher stake in a United Democratic Front victory as Leader of the Opposition.An understanding on Wayanad paved the way for Adoor Prakash’s candidature from Attingal and Shanimol Usman’s from Alappuzha. This is not for the first time that Vadakara is posing a challenge to the Congress.Crisis timeIn 2009, the party had to grapple with candidate selection at a time when the CPI(M) was on the back foot after the Janata Dal (S) headed by M.P. Veerendra Kumar had quit the Left Democratic Front (LDF).The choice finally fell on Mullappally Ramachandran, who went on to win the seat for two consecutive terms.In the upcoming election, the Congress has the onerous task of fielding a candidate against a candidate who has been branded by the party as the face of political violence.The Congress leaders will also have to examine the undercurrent that the CPI(M) candidate might trigger because of what his party says is his strident stand against majority and minority fundamentalism and its impact on some of the Malabar constituencies.Strong candidateThe AICC was reportedly flooded with e-mail and fax messages urging it to field a strong candidate in Vadakara. It was not surprising that the Congress candidates from Malabar constituencies too shared the view that Mr. Ramachandran should be in the fray.Till late in the evening, Mr. Ramachandran held out refusing to enter the electoral fray from Vadakara."

Hunt on for Turkish-born man; security tightened ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A gunman killed three people and wounded nine on a streetcar in the Dutch city of Utrecht on Monday morning in what the Mayor said appeared to be a terror attack, touching off a manhunt.Authorities immediately raised the terror alert for the area to the highest level. Security at airports and key buildings were tightened.The Utrecht police later released a photo of 37-year-old Turkish-born man Gokmen Tanis and said he was “associated with the attack.”The incident came three days after 50 people were killed by a white supremacist at two mosques in New Zealand. There was no immediate indication of any link between the two events.Utrecht Mayor Jan van Zanen said three people were killed and nine wounded, three of them seriously.“We cannot exclude, even stronger, we assume a terror motive,” Mayor van Zanen said.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that “a terror motive is not excluded” and that the attack was met throughout the country with “a mix of disbelief and disgust.”“If it is a terror attack, then we have only one answer — our nation, democracy, must be stronger that fanaticism and violence,” he added.The shooting took place at a busy intersection in a residential neighborhood. Police erected a white tent over an area where a body appeared to be lying next to the tram.Anti-terror officers gathered in front of an apartment building close to the scene. A dog wearing a vest with a camera mounted on it was also seen outside the building.Police spokesman Bernhard Jens said one person might have fled by car, and he did not rule out the possibility that more than one shooter was involved.The Netherlands’ anti-terror coordinator, Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, raised the threat alert to its highest level, 5, around Utrecht, a city of nearly 350,000.Political parties halted campaigning ahead of provincial elections scheduled for Wednesday that will also determine the makeup of Parliament’s upper house.In neighboring Germany, police said they stepped up surveillance of the Dutch border, watching not only major highways but also minor crossings and train routes.German authorities said they were initially told to look out for a red Renault Clio compact car but were later informed it had been found abandoned in Utrecht."

Nitrazepam tablets are not allowed to be sold without prescriptions
",,"About a month ago a few drunken youngsters beat up a chemist at a medical shop in Kollam after he denied them nitrazepam tablets without a prescription. The All Kerala Chemists and Druggists Association (AKCDA) is now set to lodge a police complaint.The incident indicates the soaring demand for hypnotic drug among youngsters looking to hit a high cheaply. Included in Schedule H1 as per the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, nitrazepam tablets are not allowed to be sold by medical shops without prescriptions and they should maintain records of its sale.In Ernakulam, excise officials are seizing it at an alarming rate. As many as 150 nitrazepam tablets were seized from two youngsters last week alone.Slack enforcement‘‘Thanks to slack enforcement, medical shops in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka sell them quite liberally unlike the ones here, which don't sell them without prescription. While they charge an inflated price, it hardly makes a dent in the profit margin of those looking to make a quick buck,’’ an Excise intelligence official toldThe Hindu.Nitrazepam sold in 5 mg and 10 mg are priced between Rs. 2.50-Rs. 3 and Rs. 4-Rs. 5.15 a tablet respectively in the State. However, the drug smuggled in from outside are sold for as high as Rs. 100 a tablet, bringing a windfall to the peddler.‘‘Those aged between 15 and 30 years are the targeted consumers, who, once they become addicts, are turned into carriers for a negligible fee with a strip or two thrown in. Easy to access and consume makes it a favourite and its tough for enforcement officials to detect it, as every tablet cannot be seized and tested,’’ the official said.Manoj G. Panicker, head of the department (medicines), Government General Hospital, Ernakulam, said the drug usually prescribed for the aged suffering from anxiety and sleeplessness is addictive in nature. ‘‘Addicts denied it will show withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, violence and sleeplessness,’’ he said.A.N. Mohan, State president, AKCDA, said by not issuing prescriptions in a legible manner in capital letters, as required under the Professional Conduct Etiquette and Ethics Regulations framed by the Indian Medical Council, many medical professionals cause needless arguments between chemists and consumers at medical shops about the veracity of prescriptions."

Jayaraman has reiterated his charge that the DMK was politicising the issue.“Just look at the sequence of events in the whole issue. It is clear that it is the DMK’s agenda. The party president M.K. Stalin and former Minister K. Ponmudy have said that this case will be beneficial for the DMK in the elections,” he toldThe Hindu.“I was the first person who said that the case can be investigated by the CB-CID, the CBI or even Interpol. If our family is found guilty, my family and I are ready to stand before the public and accept any punishment they give us,” he said.Charge against mediaStating that he had helped the affected girl lodge a police complaint when they were traumatised, he accused the media of trying to portray him as a culprit.“Has anyone asked for proof fromNakkheeranGopal (editor ofNakkheeran) or Stalin or Kanimozhi, who are fanning the controversy, about the involvement of the AIADMK? Mr. Gopal has put out photos of my sons declaring that they were involved and that they should be shot. Isn’t he inciting violence? How will the girl’s family feel about this [videos leaked byNakkheeran],” he asked. Mr. Jayaraman questioned why no Opposition leader, especially Ms. Kanimozhi, visited and supported the affected girl.“The Opposition will run away from the issue after the Lok Sabha elections. But I will remain with her family. I am still insisting that all those affected should come forward and lodge complaints,” he said.ArrestedThe police, according to him, arrested the key accused Thirunavukkarasu only after Pollachi AIADMK MP Mahendran and “my son submitted a representation to the police.”The girl and her brother have said “I supported them but the media blacked out even her lawyer’s statements.”As for expelled AIADMK functionary ‘Bar’ Nagarajan’s role in assaulting the girl’s brother, Mr. Jayaraman countered, “Everyone is talking about him but why is no one speaking about the first accused Senthil, who is a close friend of the son of a local DMK leader.”"

‘Party practising politics of hate, mistrust’ ",,"National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Sunday said the BJP was creating a fear psychosis across the country “by crying hoarse over the nation being in danger”.“India is not in danger, it is the BJP that is in danger due to rug slipping from under the feet of the Prime Minister ahead of general election,” said Dr. Abdullah in his public address in Jammu.He said the politics of hate and mistrust was being perpetrated and practised by the BJP. “This is against the very idea of India. Instead of dividing the people in the name of religion, caste and region, everyone should be treated as a compatriot, which alone can lead the country to progress and harmony,” he added.Referring to air strikes, Dr. Abdullah said: “It was a selective outrage. Similar concern and anguish should have been demonstrated over the killing of security forces in Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh and elsewhere. Nobody from the Centre even visited those martyrs.”He said Mr. Modi used to censure the Centre as the Chief Minister of Gujarat on the rising prices and growing unemployment, “but now he has no answers or explanations to offer to the people”."

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Sunday said the Janmabhoomi committees constituted by the TDP government would be disbanded right on the first day of his party forming the government if they were given an opportunity to serve the people.The Opposition party leader took part in his first public meeting at Narsipatnam in Visakhapatnam district here hours after releasing the list of candidates in Kadapa district.Addressing the large gathering, Mr. Jagan said law and order had deteriorated a lot under the ‘corrupt’ TDP rule citing his uncle Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy’s brutal murder in his house. He said education, employment for locals, water for irrigation fields and a few others would be his top priority. He also assured that the party would strive hard to get the Special Category Status.Most part of his speech was devoted to lashing out at Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu while not making much criticism on the NDA government. He also did not mention anything on the formation of the South Coast Railway with headquarters in Visakhapatnam and by merging parts of the Waltair division in the Vijayawada and the Rayagada divisions.‘Do not accept money’He said his party would would focus on improving quality of education in the government schools in all the districts and public could compare the difference within the next two years.He took strong exception to the failure of the TDP Government in not filling about 2.3 lakh vacant posts in the State.The YSRCP leader also appealed to public not to believe in the words and assurances of Mr. Chandrababu Naidu. He said TDP men would be busy now sending money to villages and lure voters. He asked public not to take money from the TDP.‘Vizianagaram ignored’Mr. Jagan said the TDP government had absolutely ignored the development of the backward Vizianagaram district. At an election campaign in Denkada of the Nellimarla constituency, he charged the TDP government with failing to establish medical and degree colleges and release funds for the development of Vizianagaram as smart city. He also said the TDP government had indulged in malpractices in finalising tenders in the Bhogapuram airport while not allowing the Airport Authority of India to participate in the process. “Hundreds of farmers and others are migrating from Vizianagaram due to lack of livelihood. The linkage of rivers, modernisation of projects, completion of existing projects were ignored. All round development became a dream due to poor administration.”A few people received injuries when a portion of wall collapsed at the venue. One of them who received serious injuries was shifted to the government hospital. Mr. Jagan asked the local YSRCP leaders to ensure proper medical treatment to all the victims.‘Corruption at its peak’In Kakinada, terming the elections as a war between the righteousness and unrighteousness, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy called upon the party workers to take the party’s manifesto to each and every household.Addressing people at Ambajipeta in P. Gannavaram Assembly constituency, Mr. Reddy said he knew about the problems of all the sections and decided to address them soon after being voted to power.“Farmers are not getting price for their produce and the poor are unable to bear the medical expenses. Students are not getting scholarship and fee reimbursement and the unemployed are given a raw deal,” he said.“Though the Godavari is flowing here, farmers are not getting water for the second crop. Though oil companies are exploring oil and natural gas, there are no jobs to the local people and no benefit to the local industries. This is nothing but the result of the lopsided policies of the government,” he said.‘Anti-people policies’Accusing the State government of taking corruption to its peaks in the last five years, Mr. Jagan said law and order in the State was at question now.“The government is sponsoring violence and levelling baseless allegations against the Opposition,” he said, adding that people were observing the words and deeds of the ruling party leaders and they were fed up with the anti-people policies of the TDP."

Ex-President’s brother emerges as a possible candidate for presidential poll
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Following months of speculation, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s political camp appears to have come closer to finalising the candidate for the presidential race later this year. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Defence Secretary and a younger brother of the ex-President, is very likely to represent the clan and its followers, political sources toldThe Hindu.Though there has been no official announcement in this regard, a top political source said the family has now come to an understanding on the matter. “A decision was reached at a recent dinner meeting held at the former President’s residence last week,” the source said on Monday. “They think it is premature to name the candidate now since we have at least a few months until elections,” the source familiar with the discussions said, requesting anonymity.Mr. Gotabaya’s potential candidature signals the family’s comeback bid in the country’s national politics, after losing the presidential poll in 2015. The former Defence Secretary has applied to denounce his U.S. citizenship, as Sri Lankan law prevents dual citizens from contesting. Mr. Rajapaksa cannot contest elections to the top office, as a 2015 legislation disallows a third term.Mr. Gotabaya has been focussing on strengthening his own political base over the last two years. Meanwhile, Basil Rajapaksa, another brother of the former President, has been working on building a new party — the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or People’s Front.The party, with Mr. Rajapaksa as itsde factoleader, made significant gains in the local authority elections held in early 2018. The polls saw the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), one of the two traditional mainstream parties of the country in which the former President began and built his political career, pushed to a distant third position. Subsequently, the fragmented SLFP weakened further, with a some of its members defecting to the new party.SLFP-SLPP alliance?The SLPP and the SLFP are currently exploring a possible alliance in the presidential poll, but with the SLFP maintaining that it would field President Maithripala Sirisena, it remains to be seen if the party will back Mr. Gotabaya.Mr. Gotabaya, 69, remains a controversial figure in Sri Lankan politics, especially among minority Tamils and Muslims. He is currently fighting multiple court cases in which he is charged with large-scale corruption. In March 2017, Sri Lanka’s Criminal Investigations Department (CID) told a magistrate court in March 2017 that Mr. Gotabaya directed a top-secret death squad which targeted journalists and dissidents, news agency AFP reported. He has denied the allegations. The media and civil society have in the past accused him of overseeing the infamous ‘white-van abductions’ during the war and soon after. The former defence secretary has denied having a role in the enforced disappearances.Further, Mr. Gotabaya has in the past been associated with hard-line Buddhist group Bodu Bala Sena that is notorious for inciting anti-Muslim violence.His supporters, on the other hand, see him as a ‘doer’ and ‘strong leader’ , often pointing to his role in “ending the war”, and efforts in urban development, which was subsumed into the Defence Ministry during his time as secretary. Expressing his interest in entering politics earlier, Mr. Gotabaya once remarked that he was studying Donald Trump as a model."

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to hold Cabinet meeting on gun laws today
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"New Zealanders flocked to pay tribute on Sunday to the 50 worshippers slain in a twin mosque attack, as families clamoured for the return of their dead.Coroners said they hoped to let grieving relatives fulfil Islamic burial customs soon, but insisted they had to move carefully through their investigation into the horrific multiple murder.As New Zealand grappled to come to terms with the slaughter — the worst attack on Muslims in a Western country — tales of heroism, suffering and incredible grace began to emerge.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her office and some 30 other officials had received attacker Brenton Tarrant’s lengthy, meandering “manifesto” by email about nine minutes before the attack. “It did not include a location, it did not include specific details,” she said, adding that it was sent to security services within two minutes of receipt.Unidentified packageThe country remained on high alert on Sunday, with police closing an airport in the southern city of Dunedin — where Tarrant had lived — after an unidentified package was spotted on the airfield. The dead from Friday’s attack span generations, aged between three and 77, according to a sombre list circulated among relatives.Some victims came from the neighbourhood, others from as far afield as Egypt or Fiji. At least two of the dead — a father and son — came from the same family. Authorities said 34 people remained in hospital.Among those fighting for their lives is four-year-old Alin Alsati. The pre-schooler was praying alongside her father Wasseim at the Al Noor mosque when she was shot at least three times.Her father, who was also shot at, recently emigrated to New Zealand from Jordan.Heroic rescueThe number of dead and injured could have been higher, were it not for people like Afghan refugee Abdul Aziz.Mr. Aziz was at the Linwood mosque with his four sons when he rushed the attacker armed with the only weapon he could find — a hand-held credit card machine. When Mr. Aziz heard one of his four sons cry “Daddy, please come back inside!” he picked up an empty shotgun discarded by the gunman and shouted “come on here” repeatedly in an effort to draw him away from his sons and the other worshippers. “I just wanted to save as much lives as I could, even if I lose my life,” said Mr. Aziz.The mosque attacks have shaken the usually peaceful country, which prides itself on welcoming refugees fleeing violence or persecution.On Monday, Ms. Ardern — who spent Sunday morning with the Muslim community of Wellington — will gather her Cabinet to discuss changing the country’s gun laws.That could include a ban on semi-automatic weapons of the type used by Tarrant.Ms. Ardern also wants answers from social media giants over the livestreaming of the carnage. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack around the world in the first 24 hours."

Former detainees, however, said they were held in abusive conditions, forced to renounce Islam and swear allegiance to China’s ruling Communist Party.The lengthy report issued on Monday also said the “law-based de-radicalisation” in Xinjiang has curbed the rise and spread of religious extremism.It said 1,588 terrorist gangs have been crushed and 12,995 terrorists seized since 2014. Over that time, 2,052 explosive devices were seized and more than 30,000 people punished for taking part in almost 5,000 “illegal religious activities,” the report said. It added that 345,229 copies of “illegal religious publicity materials,” were also seized.It has spent decades trying to suppress pro-independence sentiment fueled in part by frustration about an influx of migrants from China’s Han majority. Beijing Authorities said extremists there have ties to foreign terror groups but have given little evidence to support that.Despite the region’s religious, linguistic and cultural differences with the rest of country, China says Xinjiang has been Chinese territory since ancient times.In addition to their answering concerns about violence, experts and Uighur activists believe the camps are part of an aggressive government campaign to erode the identities of the Central Asian groups who called the region home long before waves of Han migrants arrived in recent decades.Monday’s paper sought to underplay Islam’s role in the region’s historical makeup, saying that while it “cannot be denied that Xinjiang received the influence of Islamic culture,” that did not change the “objective fact” that Xinjiang’s culture is merely a facet of Chinese culture.“Islam is not the natural faith of the Uighurs and other ethnicities, nor is it their only faith,” the report said."

Aijaz Khan and Rasika Dugal talk about making a film in a conflict zone
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Kashmir inhabits your being. All it takes is one visit or maybe, one film. Filmmaker Aijaz Khan and actor Rasika Dugal, sound overwhelmed, nervous and excited, as they talk about makingHamid.Hamidcomes at a crucial time in terms of the political situation and the ongoing discourse in the country. The Indian film industry’s contribution to conversations about Kashmir has been rather significant this year with the success ofUri. Amidst, the recent incidents of violence against Kashmiri traders and students in India and the perpetual strife that people live through in Kashmir, what would Khan and Dugal want a film likeHamidattempts to convey.The director of the film speaks about honesty and innocence that only children can have, and how that virtue is what theHamidis trying to convey. He says, “What media portrays of that place, what you hear about it is completely different from what you see when you land there.”One-line inspirationThe film is about a young boy, Hamid (Talha Arshad Reshi), who assumes that 786 is a direct phone line to Allah. When he calls the number, hoping to reach his untraceable father, a CRPF soldier posted in the State is on the other end instead.Hamidwas born out of a chance conversation between Khan and a friend from Srinagar. The latter talked about a play he saw the previous night, in which a boy dials 786 and gets connected to a Kashmiri Pandit. It was this single line which intrigued Khan enough to decide that the Mohammed Amin Bhat play had to be adapted into a film. The research that followed through several visits to Kashmir and conversations opened new boxes and doors. The director credits his writer Ravinder Randhawa for achieving this goal. “A one-line idea was given to him and he fleshed out these characters, details and their world,” says Khan. He shares how choosing the profession Hamid’s father as a boat-maker was an intentional one. “Boat-making is somehow a coastal imagery. It was the contrast that caught our eye,” says Khan while reminiscing about the locations that led them to the artisans who buildshikaras.Khan was clear from the beginning that he wanted to cast Dugal as Hamid’s mother. Says Dugal, “I told him, I think you should cast a Kashmiri actor because I was nervous about whether I would be able to do justice to this. I didn’t want to do injustice to the story of Kashmiri people because they’ve already been through too much. I felt that no matter how much I prepare, I will always be an outsider to that grief, to that story,” shares Dugal. It was Khan’s conviction that convinced Dugal to take on the role. Khan admires Dugal’s work to develop her character – a woman whose husband has vanished. “She came to Kashmir two weeks in advance to prepare for the role and get the accent right. It’s lovely to work with actors who come with more than 100%,” he says.An actor preparesSo how does an actor understand a character set in this context? “There is tons of material on Kashmir. I didn’t know which would be the one that would move beyond a political connection or even just an empathetic connection…,” says Dugal. The actor hoped her character Ishrat, at least, was able to truly inhabit that world. The research led Dugal to several books and documentaries and one that stood out most was Iffat Fatima’sWhere Have You Hidden My New Moon Crescent.The documentary features the activist and founder-chairperson of APDP (Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons), Parveena Ahanger. The film draws attention to disappearances in the State through Mughal Masi’s story, who eventually died after waiting 20 long years for her son to return. “Of all the material I read and accessed, this film really became my central piece.” says Dugal who highlights a moving moment in the documentary where Ahanger and Masi talk matter-of-factly about their missing children. “It’s the most chilling thing that I had seen. It moved me in a different way… I cannot put words to it and belittle that experience,” she says. Dugal went on to see several interviews by Ahanger, to find herself further surprised. “To have that kind of strength in spite of that kind of grief. Overcoming that grief and helping people who are in a similar situation is something that I still can’t wrap my head around,” she says about Ahanger.Perhaps this what cinema does to our lives. It brings us conversations outside of what we see through other platforms and stories. Dugal feels the same for hernew film, “I’m hoping thatHamidwill be that gentle conversation which I haven’t heard up till now,” she asserts.It’s lovely to work with actors who come with more than 100%Aijaz KhanDirector"

Long after the reporters and workers have left for the day, robust newsrooms and union offices have compelling tales to tell. Noel Bowler travels the world photographing the unvarnished truth about these spaces
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The conference room atThe Hinduheadquarters in Chennai echoes to the sound of Noel Bowler’s rich Irish brogue. The 41-year-old from England has spent nearly a decade hearing his voice echo in uninhabited rooms around the world. The lecturer in Photography at University Campus Suffolk trains his camera on an unusual subject — dormant spaces that until a few hours ago were alive with conversation and creativity.“Spaces with no people — that’s the kind of photography I’m interested in. I like the idea that when someone looks at the picture of an empty room, they imagine the people. Every person brings his own ideals and prejudices to it. If you have a person seated at the desk, I think they would examine it less critically. If all the information is there, there is nothing to challenge you,” says Bowler, who was in India recently as part of a four-year project capturing newsrooms across the world. This is Bowler’s second such venture. His earlier work, published as a bookUnionin 2015, is a portrait of union offices redolent with the air of animated conversation. Drawn from 14 countries, from the US and Poland to his native Ireland, it was an attempt to capture beleaguered centuries-old organisations founded at a time when the idea of work was different.Criss-crossing the globe“I began with a trilogy of ideas — union, newsrooms and finance. I have long been interested in the labour market. For the current project,The Hinduis one of the few newspapers I could access in South Asia,” says Bowler, adding, “I started where I lived, in Dublin, withThe Irish Times. During the course of my research, I read an article inThe New York Timesabout the paper moving online and I thought it fascinating to capture print newsrooms before they disappear. When I moved to England, I photographed atThe Independent, The Sun, theFinancial TimesandThe Telegraph. In the US, it wasThe New York Times, The Washington Post, and thePittsburgh Post-Gazette.In Japan, I visitedThe Asahi ShimbunandThe Yomiuri Shimbunand in Paris,Le Monde. I look at large circulated papers representative of an ethos. And since I can’t afford to fly everywhere, it is also dictated by budget.” With a rare interest that straddles the worlds of photography and travel, Bowler feels that projects have to crystallise despite a time frame. “A project is finished when it is finished. I have a general idea of a newsroom, but I’m not a journalist; neither have I worked with a newspaper. I have to learn from everyone I meet and allow the project to change slightly. I have a set pattern of how I approach it, the logistics of how I organise it and how I get to it.I keep an open mind on the narrative.” Each of his pictures begs to tell a story. Bowler’s newsrooms capture reporters’ desks crowded with leaning stacks of books and sheaves of paper, the odd one filled with curios from around the world and family photographs, and corridors with potted plants that lead to rooms where stories of shifting geopolitics are written.Mirroring societyThere is both hubris and history in the union rooms filled with plaques and worn-out jackets; the stillness of the space lends it a sensory air and a voice despite the absence of people.Bowler’s portraits are a microcosm of the world inhabited by people, through their articles of faith, half-written notes, empty water bottles and stationery. “I don’t clean up. The idea of photography is truth. I’m interested in the evidence of people than the people themselves.” It is an interest that Bowler has pursued since he first fell in love with photography as a pre-teen. “I had a Yashica and I took pictures of clichéd images like sunsets. I found it therapeutic. I loved the process.”Manual labourBowler also has a Canon DSLR 5D Mark III, but it “doesn’t see the room in the same way. It’s way more elongated. For the projects, I use a Mamiya RB67, a fully manual camera. I use medium format film; it’s a slow process with 10 frames per roll. I have to wait till I process the film in England to see the results.”Does he capture life beyond newsrooms as he travels the world? “I do, but I use my phone for social media. Every city reminds you of somewhere else. Chennai is much like Bangkok but crazier, as far as traffic goes,” says Bowler. “I love photographing architecture in general, interiors in particular. I like the ordinary and the everyday, more than the spectacular. I love the idea that the dirt on the walls lends it character.”Bowler, whose work has been exhibited worldwide, including at The New York Photo Festival and Les Rencontres d’Arles, says his place of passion is Italy. “The narrow streets, the buildings, it’s a very Instagramable country.”At the University, the photograher teaches Critical Theory and Ambition. “It’s a difficult thing to teach; I try and inspire students to drive themselves. It’s hard because it isn’t in a book, so you set an example. I’d like to come back to India. Working in Afghanistan was a challenge. I didn’t photograph the war but women’s football. It was more interesting than the bombs. That’s where we should be looking. We have to show the violence, but also that life goes on.”All by itselfTristan da Cunha is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, lying approximately 2,432 km off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa."

The attack on mosques is a wake-up call on the anti-immigration, white supremacist cult
",,"New Zealand was shaken to its core on Friday when at least 49 people were killed by a gunman in two mosques in Christchurch. Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the suspect, livestreamed the massacre on social media after releasing a white supremacist manifesto that called for removing the “invaders” and “retaking” Europe. The 27-year-old Australian, who the authorities said was not on any intelligence watch list, apparently travelled to New Zealand to carry out the attack. His targets were clearly Muslims, who make up less than 1% of New Zealand’s population. The manifesto and the symbols he carried suggest that he was influenced by far-right terrorists and their anti-Muslim, anti-immigration and anti-Semite ideology. He came in military fatigues, wore neo-Nazi emblems and was listening in his car to a song devoted to Bosnian war criminal Radovan Karadžić. The manifesto lauds Anders Breivik, the Norwegian far-right terrorist who killed 77 people in 2011 and released a 1,518-page racist manifesto. He saw President Donald Trump as a “symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose”.Right-wing racist terror, which has largely been on the fringes in the post-War world, is emerging as a major political and security threat, especially in white-majority societies. In recent years, mosques in Germany and France have been targeted; in Britain an MP was stabbed to death; and in the U.S. a synagogue was attacked, leaving 11 people dead. In most cases, the attackers were obsessed with immigration and the far-right ideas of Euro-Christian white racial purity, which is fundamentally not different from the ideology of the Nazis. The language these attackers use resembles that of mainstream anti-immigrant politicians in Western countries, such as Mr. Trump, who wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.; Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, who wants to defend “Christian Europe”; or Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, known for his hardline views on migrants. Besides, a number of far-right parties known for their Islamophobic, white nationalist views are either in power in Europe or are on the rise, be it the Freedom Party of Austria, the AfD of Germany or the National Front of France. While they and their leaders set the broad contours of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic politics as part of their nationalist narrative, neo-Nazis such as Breivik and the Christchurch shooter are killing common people. Societies worldwide should wake up to the growing danger right-wing racist terrorism poses, and not view it as mere isolated, irrational responses to Islamist terror. It has to be fought politically, by driving a counter-narrative to white supremacism, and by using the security apparatus, through allocation of enough resources to tackle all threats of violence."

Aijaz Khan and Rasika Dugal talk about making a film in a conflict zone
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Kashmir inhabits your being. All it takes is one visit or maybe, one film. Filmmaker Aijaz Khan and actor Rasika Dugal, sound overwhelmed, nervous and excited, as they talk about makingHamidwhich is in theatres.When a film is placed in a conflict zone ridden with political complexities and emotional casualties, much likeHamidis, it’s inevitable that the process will be more complicated.Hamidcomes at a crucial time in terms of the political situation and the ongoing discourse in the country. The Indian film industry’s contribution to conversations about Kashmir has been rather significant this year with the success ofUri. Amidst, the recent incidents of violence against Kashmiri traders and students in India and the perpetual strife that people live through in Kashmir, what would Khan and Rasika want a film likeHamidattempts to convey.The director of the film speaks about honesty and innocence that only children can have, and how that virtue is what theHamidis trying to convey. He says, “What media portrays of that place, what you hear about it is completely different from what you see when you land there.”One-line inspirationThe film is about a young boy, Hamid (Talha Arshad Reshi), who assumes that 786 is a direct phone line to Allah. When he calls the number, hoping to reach his untraceable father, a CRPF soldier posted in the State is on the other end instead.Hamidwas born out of a chance conversation between Khan and a friend from Srinagar. The latter talked about a play he saw the previous night, in which a boy dials 786 and gets connected to a Kashmiri Pandit. It was this single line which intrigued Khan enough to decide that the Mohammed Amin Bhat play had to be adapted into a film. The research that followed through several visits to Kashmir and conversations opened new boxes and doors. Khan shares that understanding life in Kashmir, and ensuring that the locale didn’t become a mere backdrop was always the core focus. The director credits his writer Ravinder Randhawa for achieving this goal. “A one-line idea was given to him and he fleshed out these characters, details and their world,” says Khan. Talking about the nuances they have layered the film with, he shares how choosing the profession Hamid’s father as a boat-maker was an intentional one. “Boat-making is somehow a coastal imagery. It was the contrast that caught our eye,” says Khan while reminiscing about the locations that led them to the artisans who buildshikaras.An actor preparesKhan was clear from the beginning that he wanted to cast Rasika as Hamid’s mother. “I told him, I think you should cast a Kashmiri actor because I was nervous about whether I would be able to do justice to this. I didn’t want to do injustice to the story of Kashmiri people because they’ve already been through too much. I felt that no matter how much I prepare, I will always be an outsider to that grief, to that story,” says Rasika. It was Khan’s conviction that convinced Rasika to take on the role. Khan admires Rasika’s work to develop her character – a woman whose husband has vanished. “She came to Kashmir two weeks in advance to prepare for the role and get the accent right. It’s lovely to work with actors who come with more than 100%,” he says.Over the years, thousands of men in the State have gone missing and the endless wait for them is a reality lived by several Kashmiri women. So how does an actor understand a character set in this context? “There is so much material on Kashmir. I didn’t know which would be the one that would move beyond a political connection or even just an empathetic connection…,” says Rasika. The actor hoped her character Ishrat, at least, was able to truly inhabit that world. The research led Rasika to several books and documentaries and one that stood out most was Iffat Fatima’sWhere Have You Hidden My New Moon Crescent.The documentary features the activist and founder-chairperson of APDP (Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons), Parveena Ahanger.The film draws attention to disappearances in the State through Mughal Masi’s story, who eventually died after waiting 20 long years for her son to return.“Of all the material I read and accessed, this film really became my central piece.” says Rasika who highlights a moving moment in the documentary where Ahanger and Masi talk matter-of-factly about their missing children. “It’s the most chilling thing that I had seen.

Deadlock over 4 Cong. seats continues,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/deadlock-over-4-cong-seats-continues/article26564547.ece,"
Wayanad continues to be bone of contention, Chandy to rejoin talks today
",,"The Congress high command continues to grapple with factional tussle over the selection of candidates for the Wayanad, Vadakara, Alappuzha and Attingal Lok Sabha constituencies. AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy will rejoin the discussion on Monday after returning to Delhi.Wayanad continues to be the bone of contention between the factions led by Mr. Chandy and Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala. Mr. Chandy has put his foot down for the Wayanad seat for his close aide T. Siddique, who is currently Kozhikode DCC president. Mr. Chandy had returned to Kerala on Saturday even before the Congress central election committee completed its discu- ssion on the list, clearly indicating his mind. Mr. Chennithala has nominated Shanimol Usman. It has almost become certain that Adoor Prakash, MLA, will contest the Attingal seat, though a formal announcement will be made only on the basis of the Wayanad outcome.Mr. Chennithala has ruled out the question of letting go Wayanad seat, which is reckoned as a bastion of the Congress and had been contested by his faction in 2009 and 2014, since it would lead to an imbalance in the factional computations. Mr. Chandy, however, underplayed his Delhi visit by stating that it had no connection with the candidate selection of the four seats.His visit was in connection with the candidate selection for Andhra Pradesh, where he is in charge as AICC general secretary.Vadakara seatThe party high command has the task of making a fair selection for the Vadakara seat, especially in the context of the fact that the CPI(M) has fielded P. Jayarajan, who has always been targeted by Congress leaders for allegedly promoting the cult of political violence.The party leaders are also examining the undercurrents triggered off by the calculated risk the CPI(M) appears to have taken in the constituency located in Malabar, where majority and minority communalism are dominant electoral issue.The selection of candidates for the four seats are interlinked because Mr. Siddique and Ms. Usman are being considered for either of these seats. Another active name doing the rounds is that of V.V. Prakash, DCC president of Malappuram."

In a democracy, we need a PM who listens to everybody, consults everyone, then takes a decision, the RLD chief says.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Moving away from his traditional seat of Bhagpat where he was trounced in 2014, veteran Jat leader and Rashtriya Lok Dal president Ajit Singh (80) says he is contesting from Muzaffarnagar to heal the violent communal divide.How important is this election for you, especially after a string of defeats?How important this election is for me, that’s not the question. [The question is] how important it is for the country, for democracy, for keeping our Constitution and saving all our constitutional bodies. If people lose faith in constitutional bodies, there is no democracy. Therefore, this is a very important election. And like Mr. [Amit] Shah said, if Modi wins this time he will be Prime Minister for 50 years. That means there will be no democracy.You think it’s a greater challenge than RLD, SP or BSP...Than me or who is winning... And one thing is very clear as far as U.P. is concerned, this combination, nobody can beat.Why do you think so?Look at the arithmetic.Just arithmetic or is there anything else to the alliance?Every part of society, be it farmers, youth, minority or Dalits — everybody is angry with the government. See, election in a democracy is all about what they have done in the five years; whether to give them another chance . If you look at it, they have not done anything, except a lot of promises of which they haven’t kept a single one. To farmers, they said they will give 150 times the cost, not done. For the youth, two crore jobs per year, now they are saying ‘makepakoras’. And clean Ganga... nothing has happened. Made in India, nothing. Smart cities, not there. So what has he done? Those are the questions and as the campaign progresses, all these questions will come up again. See, all the TV and newspapers are now saying that because of what happened [in Balakot]... but these are the issues on which people will decide. As far as that issue [Balakot air strike] is concerned, everybody is with the army.You have contested many times from Baghpat. But in 2014, not only did you lose, you stood a surprise third. So this time...The last election, at least in this part of India, was not normal because of those riots in Muzaffarnagar.Why did you choose to contest from Muzaffarnagar?Because the riot started from here. Muzaffarnagar’s message went to the whole country. And this was the reason why the BJP won.So you want to uproot the BJP from here?Yes.But isn’t this a big risk for you, since Muzaffarnagar was the hotbed of that violence and communal divide?On February 13 last year, I went to Muzaffarnagar. February 12 was my birthday, I completed 79 years. So I said, the 80th year I will spend on getting rid of that communal divide. I called itbhaichara(brotherhood). And for the last one year, I have been to at least 10 districts, two or three times and stayed there overnight, talking to different groups. So that thing is gone now. The communal divide is not there. And the Kairana election cemented the bonding together of vote banks... our votebank.Jats and Muslims are coming together like before?Yes, yes! In Kairana, not only that, our core voter voted, farmers of all castes and religions voted. Another big issue here is the cow. Cows are worshipped and they forever have been. As far as the farmers are concerned their livestock was their ATM; you need money, you go sell some cattle. Now they didn’t get their price for the sugar cane — this area depends on sugar cane for its economic survival — and then these animals are eating up their other crops. So there is a great deal of anger. That’s a very big issue here.Is that going to be a part of your campaign?I watched a lot of social media and YouTube videos in which farmers are saying, ‘Look what Yogi is doing, eating the crops.’ They call them [stray cows] Yogi and Modi.But the BJP is projecting it like they are actually protecting cows from being slaughtered...Everybody can see what the situation is; they are worse off than they were earlier.Apart from sugar cane, cows, and communal divide that you want to heal, anything else that will be an important issue?Unemployment is a very big issue.Notebandidestroyed the informal economy. And then look at GST, look at farmers, first they declare MSP, then they import all the commodities from abroad. Last year, was there a need to import sugar? Three years ago, they imported wheat when there was a bumper crop. Two years ago, they imported lentils when there was an oversupply of it.They declared MSP but depressed the market price. So farmer doesn’t get the MSP. Then the electricity prices have gone up, double. Tractors used to be tax-free but now been declared commercial vehicles and every year they have to pay tax. Now there is GST too if you are buying a tractor or its parts. Now they are saying, every 10 years you have to buy a new tractor. No farmer can afford it. They run them for 40 years. They have no idea of the rural economy. This has not only affected the farmers. That money circulated in the area. I tell these small businessmen and traders, if ₹10,000 crore is given as farmers’ sugar cane dues, in three months this will be all in your pockets. Everybody is affected right now.Have the dues been paid back to the sugar cane farmers?Mr. Modi has been saying that we have done so and we will pay in 14 days and he would not accept whatever the [actual] figures are. But it’s a plain and simple lie.RSS and BJP say other governments were corrupt and they are not...Ask any person in a village or town, ‘Has corruption increased?’ They all stand up and say ‘yes’. Forget everything, we need a PM in a democracy, who listens to everybody, consults everyone and then takes a decision. He [Mr Modi] doesn’t listen to anyone, doesn’t consult anyone or answer any questions or any press conference. We need a PM...chappan inch ki chaati theek hai, lekin dil bada hona chaiye(a 56-inch chest is fine but one must also be big-hearted). But Modi has no concern for the poor, oppressed, farmers and the unemployed.Are you happy with the three seats that have been given to you as part of the alliance (Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Mathura)?In a combination or seat adjustment, no party is ever happy. Therefore, the question is not that. It is larger. There may be all these seat differences, but in U.P., we didn’t take too much time to discuss and bicker about it... because everybody realises that it is not important.You expect that your core voter will stick with you in Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar. But in other seats where the SP and BSP are contesting, will your voters transfer to them?Yes, yes. As I said, I had gone to 10 districts...with those bhaichara meetings, so they understand.So Jats are also angry with the BJP?They are basically farmers and aggressive farmers. The farmer’s situation and the farming community feels they are being left out.On April 7, you, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati will hold a rally in Saharanpur, kicking off your joint campaign. How important is it for U.P. that you three have come together?Let me put it this way, in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana, the combination already existed. Now we have formalised it."

Mr. Chennithala has nominated Shanimol Usman. It has almost become certain that Adoor Prakash, MLA, will contest the Attingal seat, though a formal announcement will be made only on the basis of the Wayanad outcome.Mr. Chennithala has ruled out the question of letting go Wayanad seat, which is reckoned as a bastion of the Congress and had been contested by his faction in 2009 and 2014, since it would lead to an imbalance in the factional computations. Mr. Chandy, however, underplayed his Delhi visit by stating that it had no connection with the candidate selection of the four seats. His visit was in connection with the candidate selection for Andhra Pradesh, where he is in charge as AICC general secretary.The party high command has a task of making a fair selection for the Vadakara seat, especially in the context of the fact that the CPI(M) has field P. Jayarajan, who has always been targeted by the Congress leaders for allegedly promoting the cult of political violence. The party leaders are also examining the undercurrents triggered off by the calculated risk the CPI(M) appears to have taken in the constituency located in Malabar, where majority and minority communalism have been a dominant electoral issue.The selection of candidates for the four seats are interlinked because Mr. Siddique and Ms. Usman are being considered for either of these seats. Another active name doing the rounds is that of V.V. Prakash, DCC president of Malappuram, but he will get the ticket depending on a final solution that the party leaders may arrive at."

Zoya Akhtar’sMade In Heavengets flashy, obnoxious, wedding-mad Delhi just right
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Everyone onMade In Heavenis so rich! And they’re all terrible. One worse than the other. But that’s rich people for you. They’re so weird. With all their money and property and egos and sparkly shoes. But they’re also fascinating for exactly the same reasons. They are, to use a millennial term that’s as cringy as it is effective, so very extra. The new, wildly discussed Amazon Prime show lays bare the absolute worst excesses of urban upper-class India and its fixation on gloriously turbulent weddings.The whole thing is a trainwreck in slow-motion, the kind you cannot help but watch even as the world around you disintegrates. To quote but one splendid example: as thebaraatrages on at a wedding, there are frantic negotiations between the two sets of in-laws over how much dowry — or, as it’s so shiftily euphemised these days, ‘gift’ — to pay. One party wants to shell out Rs. 2 crore (only). The recipient demands twice that. Yes.Loud, bright but rightBut let’s back up a little.Made In Heaven, while not without its problems, is really quite good, hence all the buzz. Amazon brings out the big guns in this nine-episode web series created by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti, done on a scale that I, for one, am not used to seeing on a laptop. Everything is loud and colourful and bright and elaborate and breathtaking. The story goes thus: Tara and Karan (both impressively played by Sobhita Dhulipala and Arjun Mathur) run an ambitious young wedding planning company calledMade In Heaven, while maintaining an understated but powerful friendship.(Some friendly advice: if you’re planning a wedding, pleasedon’thire these chumps; a. they’re fictional, and b. wherever they go, a whole bucketload of trouble invariably follows. They’re a disaster-in-waiting, a two-headed agent of utter chaos and destruction.)Each episode tracks a new wedding, as the show zooms out to the lives of its two protagonists and their staff, as well as a revolving and revolting cavalcade of entitled rich people who are extra-insufferable on account of the impending wedding. And then everything goes wrong. Every single time.All through, Arjun faces plenty of hardship, and the show maps his journey, patiently and with care, as a young gay man in 21st century India, with its implicit and explicit homophobia. Tara, on the other hand, has had to mould her personality, coming from humble beginnings and marrying a rich industrialist. It shines a light on the inner conflict tugging at Tara in her inability to reconcile the shift in personality that she has manufactured to fit into this world. She’s steely and poker-faced, but the façade crumbles at times.What else does this absolute tornado of a series offer? Dowry, affairs, sex-tape scandals (plural), references to a saffron Ruling Party that are a total cop-out, celebrity gossip, arrests, violence, abusive kings, intimidating loan sharks, swayamvars, drug ODs, politicians with a penchant for honour killings. Oh and at one point, a woman marries a tree.This sounds larger-than-life. But is it really? The central character ofMade In Heavenis New Delhi. And I, as a not-proud, born-and-reared Delhi person, can attest that, generally, we people don’t do understated, modest, restrained anything. We are flashy and obnoxious, and doubly so at weddings. The show does falter in its visual depiction of the city — when I close my eyes and think of New Delhi,Made In Heaven’sversion is not what I see. Instead we get a Mumbai-gaze version of Delhi. Which is jarring.Behind the glitterBut that’s neither here nor there. See,Made In Heavenuses the city as a starting point to expose the roly-poly underbelly that rests contemptuously beneath the country’s wealthy elite. The fancy clothes, the constant classism, the heightened reality of the bubble these folks live in (we’re talking Rs. 5,000-crore empires, a hotel-chain named, curiously, Five Seasons, etc) , the patriarchy and misogyny, the pettiness and drama. The show doesn’t hide these realities behind a visually outsize presentation. Nor does it go overboard. It tries to provide human motivations, feelings and faces behind the evil. There’s a lot of grey, a lot of context, a lot of furious finger-pointing that this exists everywhere. It doesn’t outright satirise or demonise its characters. Though perhaps it should have.Each episode tracks a new wedding, as the show zooms out to capture the lives of its two protagonists and their staff"

"Brexit, what next?",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/brexit-what-next/article26557837.ece,"
Weeks before U.K.’s scheduled departure from the EU,there are many questions forPrime Minister Theresa May
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The story so far: British Prime Minister Theresa May has just had one of the most tumultuous weeks in her political career. With just two weeks to go before Britain’s scheduled departure from the European Union, MPs voted against her Brexit agreement, for a second time, on Tuesday. The next day, they voted to reject a no-deal exit.On Thursday, lawmakers voted against holding a second referendum on Brexit, and for seeking an extension for the departure. This means a majority of MPs want an orderly divorce with the EU, but not on the withdrawal agreement Ms. May has reached with European leaders.What’s the withdrawal agreement?It sets the terms on which a member country will leave the EU. According to the agreement reached between the U.K. and the EU, the transition period (the time to implement it) begins on March 29 and lasts till December 31, 2020. The U.K. will lose membership in the EU institutions as soon as the transition period kicks in, but will need to abide by EU rules till the transition is over. According to Ms. May’s deal, the U.K. will have to pay about £39 billion to the EU in instalments to settle all its financial obligations. It also states that U.K. citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the U.K. will retain their residency and social security rights. On the Northern Ireland border, the agreement has proposed a backstop of a single customs territory between the EU and the U.K., in case no trade deal is reached at the end of the transition period.What’s the backstop?Even when Brexit talks were under way, many had warned that the Irish border — between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member — would be the thorniest issue. In northern Ireland, decades of sectarian violence between protestants, who wanted to remain with the U.K. and Catholics, who wanted join Ireland, came to an end after the 1998 Good Friday agreement.Open border was a major part of the peace agreement. But if the U.K. leaves the EU without a proper agreement, there will be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The backstop intends to avoid such a scenario. According to Ms. May’s deal, the British government would seek to reach a trade agreement with the EU that would avoid a hard border between the Irelands. But if no trade agreement is reached between the U.K. and the EU by the end of the transition period, the backstop will come into force — a single customs territory between the EU and the U.K. In that case, Northern Ireland will be bound by many EU rules, and the U.K. cannot leave the backstop without the EU’s approval.Why did MPs oppose the deal?The central issue of the opposition is the backstop. Conservative MPs who voted twice against their Prime Minister’s deal say the backstop would permanently entrap the U.K. within the customs union and the single market. Within the customs union, individual members do not have the powers to impose tariffs on goods they import. Instead, the customs duty is fixed by the EU. So if the U.K. fails to reach a trade agreement with the EU during the transition period and the backstop comes into effect, the U.K. will effectively continue within the customs union. It will have to abide by the EU trade rules without having a say in EU decision-making as it would not be a member. Hard-Brexiteers call it a trap. And they oppose the present deal, while Ms. May says backstop is only an insurance and the current deal is the best the U.K. could get from the EU. The Labour Party, the main Opposition, wants a permanent customs union with the EU, but with rights to decide the U.K.’s trade policy. “Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe, and help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland,” the party said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for Ms. May’s resignation and fresh election and promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU.What is the way out?A possible scenario is the government seeking an extension to Brexit, and the EU is likely to take a decision on March 21. If the EU rejects the request, Britain will crash out on March 29. In the event of an extension, the question is how long it will be. If it’s beyond May 23, the day of elections to the European Parliament, the U.K. will have to take part in it. If the extra time is only a few weeks, the challenge is to come up with another deal acceptable to both British lawmakers and the EU.Conservative MPssay the backstop will permanently entrap the U.K.; Labour wants to renegotiate a new deal withthe EU"

The police responded with teargas and water cannon.After weeks of declining participation, France's ""yellow vest"" protest movement attempted to rebound with a major rally in Paris which quickly turned violent.A large crowd gathered on the Champs-Elysees avenue for the 18th straight week of anti-government protests which initially rocked President Emmanuel Macron's administration, forcing him to adopt more anti-poverty measures, but had appeared to fizzle in recent weeks.Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who erected barricades near the Champs-Elysees in scenes reminiscent of some of the most tense “yellow vest” rallies.Saturday's attempted reboot coincides with the end of two months of public debates called by Mr. Macron to take the heat out of the protests, which repeatedly ended in rioting in December and January.The level of participation will be seen as a bellwether of support for the movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes but quickly ballooned into an anti-Macron revolt.Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17.The organisers of Saturday's protest presented it as an “ultimatum” to Mr. Macron, prompting fears of a return to the violence that characterised earlier rallies.Over 5,000 police were deployed.A large security cordon had been thrown up around the Champs-Elysees, where the Arc de Triomphe war memorial was sacked and stores looted and vandalised by protesters on December 1 in images that caused shock worldwide.In December, Mr. Macron attempted to stopper the movement by pledging €10 billion ($11.2 billion) in tax cuts and benefits for the low paid and pensioners.He also launched a “grand national debate” on the internet and town hall meetings to gather opinions on how the country could be reformed.Laurent Casanova, an engineer who was among the protesters, toldAFPhe had come to mark the end of the consultations.“We have been patient but now we want results,” he said.The protest is one of several planned in Paris on Saturday, where French climate campaigners are also planning a “March of The Century”."

Get set for a bit of absurd realism in Eugene Ionesco’s ‘The Lesson’, presented by DCH this weekend
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Theatre of the Absurd is a moniker given to a genre of post World War-II plays where the premise is a man’s reaction to a world controlled by outside forces.Eugene Ionesco’sThe Lesson, considered one of the classic plays of our times is also one of the most celebrated under the theatre of Absurd. While the play has been performed countless times across the world, Dramatic Circle Hyderabad is bringing this masterpiece to the city which is being helmed by veteran theatre director Pranava Singhal.“While the play was written initially in the context of Nazi Fascism, we have deleted the reference of fascism in this retelling.” notes Singhal and adds, “Our fixed views are generally passed on to the younger generation without giving them a choice of free thought. There is no change of message. There is a lot of bullying of young minds — from the intellectual to the religious which is where this play holds relevance.”While the Dramatic Circle Hyderabad has performed this play in the city nearly 40 years ago, this is the first time that Singhal is captaining the ship and he shares that he hasn’t seen it being performed earlier. Remarking that the genre in which it is set is challenging, the veteran director adds, “The challenge which one faces while doing something like this is that absurd drama by definition itself is not logical. You can lose an audience easily. The trick is to make sense within nonsense, so to speak. Within the absurdity unfolding you have to make sense, so that the message won’t get lost in the absurdity.”For a play under this genre to succeed, the director feels that the onus is on the actors. He explains, “There needs to be strong understanding of the concept not only by the director but also by the actors, only then can the message be conveyed to the audience. The format makes it very interesting as it’s not just another sequential events at play, and the difficult part for the actors is that when the lines are non-sequential they have to work all the more harder. They have to get the lines precisely right.” Singhal has previously worked on other plays under this genre, including another famous play,Waiting for Godotby Samuel Beckett which he acted and co-directed a long time ago.With a run time of 80 minutes,The Lessonchecks all the boxes of an engrossing play, and Singhal says that it is relevant in today’s times. As it has a message for young people, students over 18 years can have a free entry, provided they furnish their ID proof.“The play has a mix of many emotions – sex, violence and humour, and in spite of being an Absurd play, it has a message for everyone watching. It’s very entertaining and of course, being one of the forerunners of the avante garde movement, one of the great classics of our time,” he shares.(Dramatic Circle Hyderabad (DCH) performs Eugene Ionesco’s ‘The Lesson’ at Phoenix Arenaon Sunday March 17 at 7 30 pm; Tickets bookmyshow.com)"

The rally was called to coincide with the end of two months of public debates called by President Emmanuel Macron to give voters a forum to air their grievances and propose policy changes.The protesters have dismissed the debates as a smoke-screen.Focal pointThousands of people converged on the Champs-Elysees — focal point of the Paris protests over the past four months — for “Act XVIII” of a movement which had appeared to be running out of steam but whose core demands still enjoy broad public support. The Arc de Triomphe, which was sacked by protesters on December 1, was again the focal point of the unrest.Black-clad demonstrators encircled the square surrounding the arch, pelting the police with stones. “Macron, we’re coming to get you at home,” some of the protesters chanted, referring to the presidential palace near the Champs-Elysees. Thirty-one people had been arrested by mid-morning, the police said.Interior Minister Christophe Castaner condemned the violence as the work of “professional trouble-makers” who had “infiltrated” the march and said he had ordered police to “react with the greatest firmness to these unacceptable attacks.”Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17."

Vivekananda Reddy and opening of fire by the supporters of YSR Congress MLA Bala Nagi Reddy during a scuffle with TDP candidate Tikka Reddy and his followers at Kaggal village in Mantralayam Assembly constituency.Mr. Dwivedi instructed them to take the necessary action for smooth conduct of elections, in view of the likely impact of the incidents which vitiated the peaceful atmosphere.The CEO was learnt to have told the officials to deal with any situation firmly and enquired about the poll preparedness and conditions prevalent in other districts.TDP complaintMeanwhile, Rajya Sabha member and TDP State legal cell president Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar submitted a memorandum to the CEO to take action against Sakshi newspaper and television channel for publishing/telecasting reports that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his son and Minister Lokesh were involved in Vivekananda Reddy’s murder following the making of a wild allegation by MP V. Vijayasai Reddy.These defamatory and derogatory statements were intended to incite violence and such biased comments should be dealt with an iron hand. More importantly, the reports in Sakshi media amounted violating the Model Code of Conduct in vogue for the general elections as they (Sakshi newspaper and TV channel) were promoting the poll prospects of their owner Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.In another petition to the CEO, Mr. Ravindra Kumar requested the Election Commission of India to restrict the movements of Mr. Bala Nagi Reddy accusing him and his supporters of causing bullet injuries to Mr. Tikka Reddy and some police personnel while obstructing their entry into Kaggal in Kosigi mandal of Kurnool district for campaigning."
Lure of cheap hypnotic drug high among youth,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lure-of-cheap-hypnotic-drug-high-among-youth/article26555051.ece,"
Nitrazepam tablets are not allowed to be sold by medical shops without prescriptions ",,"About a month ago a few drunken youngsters beat up a chemist at a medical shop in Kollam after he denied them nitrazepam tablets without a prescription. The All Kerala Chemists and Druggists Association (AKCDA) is now set to lodge a police complaint.The incident indicates the soaring demand for hypnotic drug among youngsters looking to hit a high cheaply. Included in Schedule H1 as per the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, nitrazepam tablets are not allowed to be sold by medical shops without prescriptions and they should maintain records of its sale.In Ernakulam, excise officials are seizing it at an alarming rate. As many as 150 nitrazepam tablets were seized from two youngsters last week alone.‘‘Thanks to slack enforcement, medical shops in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka sell them quite liberally unlike the ones here, which don't sell them without prescription. While they charge an inflated price, it hardly makes a dent in the profit margin of those looking to make a quick buck,’’ an Excise intelligence official toldThe Hindu.Nitrazepam sold in 5 mg and 10 mg are priced between ₹2.50-₹3 and ₹4-₹5.15 a tablet respectively in the State. However, the drug smuggled in from outside are sold for as high as ₹100 a tablet, bringing a windfall to the peddler.‘‘Those aged between 15 and 30 years are the targeted consumers, who, once they become addicts, are turned into carriers for a negligible fee with a strip or two thrown in. Easy to access and consume makes it a favourite and its tough for enforcement officials to detect it, as every tablet cannot be seized and tested,’’ the official said.Manoj G. Panicker, head of the department (medicines), Government General Hospital, Ernakulam, said the drug usually prescribed for the aged suffering from anxiety and sleeplessness is addictive in nature. ‘‘Addicts denied it will show withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, violence and sleeplessness,’’ he said.A.N. Mohan, State president, AKCDA, said by not issuing prescriptions in a legible manner in capital letters, as required under the Professional Conduct Etiquette and Ethics Regulations framed by the Indian Medical Council, many medical professionals cause needless arguments between chemists and consumers at medical shops about the veracity of prescriptions. ‘‘Denial of drugs over suspicion of dubious prescriptions can invite action for refusal of sale under the Drugs and Cosmetic Rules,’’ he said."

Zoya Akhtar’s ‘Made In Heaven’ gets flashy, obnoxious, wedding-mad Delhi just right ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Everyone onMade In Heavenis so rich! And they’re all terrible. One worse than the other. But that’s rich people for you. They’re so weird. With all their money and property and egos and sparkly shoes. But they’re also fascinating for exactly the same reasons. They are, to use a millennial term that’s as cringy as it is effective, so very extra. The new, wildly discussed Amazon Prime show lays bare the absolute worst excesses of urban upper-class India and its fixation on gloriously turbulent weddings.The whole thing is a trainwreck in slow-motion, the kind you cannot help but watch even as the world around you disintegrates. To quote but one splendid example: as thebaraatrages on at a wedding, there are frantic negotiations between the two sets of in-laws over how much dowry — or, as it’s so shiftily euphemised these days, ‘gift’ — to pay. One party wants to shell out ₹2 crore (only). The recipient demands twice that. Yes.Loud, bright but rightBut let’s back up a little.Made In Heaven, while not without its problems, is really quite good, hence all the buzz. Amazon brings out the big guns in this nine-episode web series created by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti, done on a scale that I, for one, am not used to seeing on a laptop. Everything is loud and colourful and bright and elaborate and breathtaking. The story goes thus: Tara and Karan (both impressively played by Sobhita Dhulipala and Arjun Mathur) run an ambitious young wedding planning company calledMade In Heaven, while maintaining an understated but powerful friendship.(Some friendly advice: if you’re planning a wedding, pleasedon’thire these chumps; a. they’re fictional, and b. wherever they go, a whole bucketload of trouble invariably follows. They’re a disaster-in-waiting, a two-headed agent of utter chaos and destruction.)Each episode tracks a new wedding, as the show zooms out to the lives of its two protagonists and their staff, as well as a revolving and revolting cavalcade of entitled rich people who are extra-insufferable on account of the impending wedding. And then everything goes wrong. Every single time.All through, Arjun faces plenty of hardship, and the show maps his journey, patiently and with care, as a young gay man in 21st century India, with its implicit and explicit homophobia. Tara, on the other hand, has had to mould her personality, coming from humble beginnings and marrying a rich industrialist. It shines a light on the inner conflict tugging at Tara in her inability to reconcile the shift in personality that she has manufactured to fit into this world. She’s steely and poker-faced, but the façade crumbles at times.What else does this absolute tornado of a series offer? Dowry, affairs, sex-tape scandals (plural), references to a saffron Ruling Party that are a total cop-out, celebrity gossip, arrests, violence, abusive kings, intimidating loan sharks, swayamvars, drug ODs, politicians with a penchant for honour killings. Oh and at one point, a woman marries a tree.This sounds larger-than-life. But is it really? The central character ofMade In Heavenis New Delhi. And I, as a not-proud, born-and-reared Delhi person, can attest that, generally, we people don’t do understated, modest, restrained anything. We are flashy and obnoxious, and doubly so at weddings. The show does falter in its visual depiction of the city — when I close my eyes and think of New Delhi,Made In Heaven’sversion is not what I see. Instead we get a Mumbai-gaze version of Delhi. Which is jarring.Behind the glitterBut that’s neither here nor there. See,Made In Heavenuses the city as a starting point to expose the roly-poly underbelly that rests contemptuously beneath the country’s wealthy elite. The fancy clothes, the constant classism, the heightened reality of the bubble these folks live in (we’re talking ₹5,000-crore empires, a hotel-chain named, curiously, Five Seasons, etc) , the patriarchy and misogyny, the pettiness and drama. The show doesn’t hide these realities behind a visually outsize presentation. Nor does it go overboard. It tries to provide human motivations, feelings and faces behind the evil. There’s a lot of grey, a lot of context, a lot of furious finger-pointing that this exists everywhere. It doesn’t outright satirise or demonise its characters. Though perhaps it should have.Akhil Sood is an author and a freelance culture writer from New Delhi who wishes he’d studied engineering instead."

He has been identified as a suspected white supremacist, based on his social media activity.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The main suspect in the shootings at two New Zealand mosques was charged with one count of murder,a day after the attacks that killed 49 people and wounded dozens, prompting the Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to vow reform of the country's gun laws.Brenton Harrison Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian citizen, appeared in the Christchurch District Court on Saturday and was remanded without a plea until his next scheduled appearance in the South Island city's High Court on April 5.Handcuffed and wearing a white prison suit, Tarrant did not speak. His court-appointed lawyer made no application for bail or name suppression.He was likely to face further charges, police said.PM Ardern terms it terrorismThe attack, which Ms. Ardern labelled as terrorism, was the worst-ever peacetime mass killing in New Zealand and the country raised its security threat level to the highest.Tarrant has been identified as a suspected white supremacist, based on his social media activity.Footage of the attack on one of the mosqueswas broadcast live on Facebook, anda “manifesto” denouncing immigrants as “invaders”was also posted online via links to related social media accounts.The video showed a man driving to the Al Noor mosque, entering it and shooting randomly at people with a semi-automatic rifle with high-capacity magazines. Worshippers, possibly dead or wounded, lay on the floor, the video showed.At one stage, the shooter returns to his car, changes weapons, re-enters the mosque and again begins shooting. The camera attached to his head follows the barrel of his weapon like some macabre video game.Forty-one people were killed at the mosque, seven at a mosque in the Linwood neighbourhood and one died in hospital, police said. Hospital officials said some of the wounded were in a critical condition.‘Shooting everyone in the mosque’One man who said he was at the mosque told media the gunman burst in as worshippers were kneeling for prayers. “He had a big gun... He came and started shooting everyone in the mosque, everywhere,” said Ahmad Al-Mahmoud. He said he and others escaped by breaking through a glass door.Police said the shooter took seven minutes to travel to the second mosque in the suburb of Linwood, where seven people were killed. No images have emerged from the second mosque.Tarrant was arrested in a car which, police said, was carrying improvised explosive devices, 36 minutes after they were first called.“The offender was mobile, there were two other firearms in the vehicle that the offender was in, and it absolutely was his intention to continue with his attack,” Ms. Ardern told reporters in Christchurch on Saturday.It was still unclear whether any other shooters were involved in the attacks.Two other people were in custody and police said they were working to understand their involvement. None of those arrested had a criminal history or were on watch lists in New Zealand or Australia.Armed police were deployed at several locations in all cities, unusual in a country that has had low levels of gun violence.Gun laws to be changedMs. Ardern said the main suspect was a licenced gun owner, who used five weapons during his rampage, including two semi-automatic weapons and two shotguns.The authorities were working to find out how he had obtained the weapons and a licence, and how he was able to enter the country to carry out the attacks, she said.“I can tell you one thing right now,our gun laws will change,” Ms. Ardern told reporters. A ban on semi-automatic weapons would be considered, she said.Sorrow, SympathyThere was heavy police presence at the hospital where the families of the more than 40 wounded had gathered. Eleven people remained in intensive care, hospital authorities said.Funerals were planned on Saturday for some of the victims, several of whom were born overseas.Dozens of people laid flowers at cordons near both mosques in the city, which is still rebuilding after a devastating earthquake in 2011 killed almost 200 people.Leaders around the world expressed sorrow and disgust at the attacks, with some deploring the demonisation of Muslims.U.S. President Donald Trump, who condemned the attacks as a “horrible massacre”, was praised by the accused gunman in a manifesto posted online as “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose”.Asked by a reporter in Washington if he thought white nationalism is a rising threat around the world, Mr. Trump said: “I don’t really. I think its a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess if you look at what happened in New Zealand perhaps that’s a case, I don’t know enough about it yet.”Ms. Ardern, who flew to Christchurch on Saturday, said she had spoken to Mr. Trump, who had asked how he could help.“My message was sympathy and love for all Muslim communities,” she said she told him.Concern over targeting of MuslimsPolitical and Islamic leaders across Asia and Middle East voiced concern over the targeting of Muslims.“I blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9/11,” Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan posted on social media. “1.3 billion Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror.”Facebook said that having been alerted by police it had deleted the gunman's accounts “shortly after the live-stream commenced”. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all said they had taken steps to remove copies of the videos.Ms. Ardern said she had asked the authorities to look into whether there was any activity on social media or elsewhere that could have alerted them ahead of the attack.Thevisiting Bangladesh cricket team was arriving for prayers at one of the mosqueswhen the shooting started but all members were safe, a team coach toldReuters.Muslims account for just over 1% of New Zealand's population, a 2013 census showed, most of whom were born overseas.Portal raises NZ$1 millionA website set up for victims had raised more than NZ$1 million ($684,000) in less than a day, and social media was flooded with messages of shock, sympathy and solidarity.One image shared widely was of a cartoon kiwi, the country's national bird, weeping. Another showed a pair of figures, one in a headscarf, embracing. “This is your home and you should have been safe here” the caption read."

The minor told DCW officials that her uncle and father frequently touched her private parts and threatened her against telling about that to anyone. After Reena came to know about the same, she decided to file a case against her husband,” a DCW official said.The women’s commission also said that an FIR has been registered against both the accused at the New Usmanpur police station.DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal said, “Sexual crime against minors is on a rise and strongest action should be taken against the father and the uncle. Systems need to be created to ensure stringent and timely punishments to sexual predators who target minors so that adequate deterrence is ensured against such crimes.”"

Roots of the India-Pakistan conflict can be found in a shared attitude of derision towards the past
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Had Krishna Sobti, the eminent Hindi novelist, not died this January, she would have renovated our appreciation of the truth about freedom and Partition occurring together. We habitually forget this truth each time we learn it. An interview she gave to Partition scholar Alok Bhalla is one among many repositories of the insight she brought to this subject. Through her fiction too, Sobti tested the strength of the social fabric that Partition shook and tried to tear apart. Why it didn’t tear completely is a question she helps us to answer.Krishna Sobti’s workSix weeks afterher death, a violent conflict broke out between India and Pakistan. The immediate, ostensible causes of the outbreak are terrorism and Kashmir. Real sources lie deeper. Reading Sobti’s works reminds you that the deeper roots of the India-Pakistan conflict can be found in a shared attitude of derision towards the past. Public mood shifts between indifference and disdain for the past. There is little genuine interest in the past or curiosity to figure it out. Politicians feel free and tempted to use the past to manipulate the collective mind.As the single most important event of our modern history, Partition illustrates the general attitude I am talking about. Across the three nations produced by Partition, there is little consensus over what it means to live with Partition. But there is a shared feeling that Partition is at the heart of many problems and behavioural reflexes. Each country looks at Partition from the perspective that the state apparatus has assiduously developed over time. The term commonly used these days is ‘narrative’. It comes in handy. It is a post-modern invention signalling the decline of interest in objectivity. The relatively better educated politicians often use it tactfully to debunk serious commentary, calling it just another narrative. So, why the different nations that constitute the South Asian region bring sharply divergent perspectives to matters of shared interest is explained in terms of diversity of narratives. Are these narratives incompatible? No one seems curious to find out. Nor is anyone actively conscious that the acceptance of incompatibility means granting permanence to intra-regional conflicts. One clear reason why no one is worried is because a feeling of permanent conflict seems to offer unlimited political capital.When SAARC was established in 1985, it created the hope that mutual understanding would be pursued as a regional political goal. For all seven members, but especially India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, mutual understanding would have meant recognising the importance of acceptable portraits of the past. Such portraits exist in literature, but historical awareness requires more than a literary portrait. It means providing reliable resources to validate a view about what happened so that we feel more comfortable with where we are in the present. This awareness is crucial to avoid a feeling among the young that they live in a dark, noisy tunnel with no known exits. An ominous uncertainty hangs over the subcontinent, best expressed by the availability of nuclear weapons to end potential conflicts.Partition’s emotional contentSobti had hoped that people could now recognise the complications arising out of history. In her interview with Professor Bhalla, she expressed the view that the emotional content of Partition had run out. This is not true. Though seven decades have passed, there is no sign that Partition is devoid of emotional content in India or in Pakistan. In a study of history textbooks used in the two countries, I found that in Pakistan, Partition is presented as unfinished business, while in India it is still viewed as a wound inflicted by Muslims and the British. In both nations, Partition continues to serve as an inflammable memory account. The toll it took on the two nations has not sufficed to cool the coals buried under the ashes of time. Apart from the destruction and violence suffered by common men, women and children on both sides of the border, the post-Partition suspension of reason cost India the life of its greatest leader. That injury has not healed, and the ideological divide it signified continues to grow. Sobti had assumed that the Constitution would unite Indian society around its core values. That did happen to an extent, but words and statements alone don’t safeguard values. Freedom and a sense of fraternity are among the values sculpted into the structure of the Constitution. Truth is not mentioned as such, but one assumes that it has an assured place in the edifice of law.Truth and warIn this context, it may be useful to recall Mahatma Gandhi’s dual commitments: truth and non-violence. The pairing of truth with non-violence suggests that truth and war are not compatible. This is why the threat of war at election time is not good news for the practice of constitutional democracy. For now, the threat of war seems to have passed, but it could easily be made to linger as a memory relevant for voting day. In this sense, the brief outbreak of armed attacks is an ominous reminder of the fragility of the equilibrium that permits us to practice democracy. In Pakistan, democracy is even more fragile. There, it barely survives under the direct shadow of modern weaponry.The India-Pakistan hostility is richly intersected by bad memories. It has perennial potential for shaping politics. Moreover, an activated conflict invites everyone to play politics. This kind of politics is necessarily manipulative. It helps to bypass more earthy questions which ought to be central to any election. These are questions like why economic growth offers little relief from unemployment, why the village languishes when the city prospers. One can add many more issues to this list. To call them peace-time issues or to designate them as being secondary in comparison to security will be to surrender to history, that too a history soaked in emotions. It is true that politics is a game played in the shadow of history. However, if it is dominated by history, then democracy can hardly serve the cause of progress, howsoever defined. It will always remain stuck in history.Krishna Kumar is a former director of the NCERT"

He picks a fight with her a few minutes into seeing her for the first time and drops her into a swimming pool.A little later, she’s in trouble, and he has to save her from some rowdy elements. Ironically, a few months later, when they get to know each other, she saves his number as ‘Rowdy’ on her phone.There’s another nice little scene in the first half, and that’s when the two of them are just getting comfortable with each other. She’s wearing his jacket and bidding him goodbye. He pulls her over for what you think will turn into a ‘moment’. But he says: “Give me back my jacket.” Like he doesn’t care much about her.He soon will –Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum, as the title suggests, pretty much revolves around the dynamics between the two. It’s a format that Kollywood has done before – in films likeVinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa,Neethaane En PonvasanthamandKaatru Veliyidaias well – and Ranjit Jeyakodi’s latest offering is let down by lack of clarity about the complications in the romance.The male lead, Gautham, a veryArjun Reddy-like character, is well performed by Harish Kalyan, but its writing is quite one-dimensional. Gautham is always one to pick up a fight, irrespective of the situation he’s in. He’s surrounded by a group of friends (Bala Saravanan and Ma Ka Pa Anand, whose funny lines don’t create any kind of stir) who make no attempt to stop him from all the violence.Any cinematic attempt at chronicling a complicated relationship, like the one tried here, needs strong leads. It looks like director Ranjit Jeyakodi was quite content with Harish and didn’t bother much about Tara (the female lead, played by Shilpa Manjunath). Tara is a wannabe-Jessie (what Trisha played inVinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa) – but the performance is nowhere near, lacking the different dimensions needed to play the complicated, indecisive female protagonist. Her take on the romance is relatable, but that doesn’t make this insipid romance attractable. The quote that kick-starts the film is: ‘The hottest love has the coldest end’. InIspade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum, the beginning itself is cold... a character is pushed into a swimming pool. The rest of the film is in troubled waters."

AfterPuriyatha Puthirreleased and wasn’t received well at the box office, Ranjit was planning to make a crime-thriller, for which he had the story ready. However, he was apprehensive that he would be perceived as a ‘dark’ filmmaker. “I didn’t want to be boxed into one category. Which is why I wantedIspade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyumto be my second film,” he adds.Ranjit says he formulated the skeleton of the story even before he made his début. Does the filmmaker decide the genre before sitting at the writing table? He laughs it off, “You can’t write a film based on its genre. The story has to take shape, which itself is a tedious process.”Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyumis an odd-yet-intriguing title to begin with.

In fact, the title is inspired from one of Jayakanthan’s short stories.” He adds, “The Spade and Queen are essential in the game of cards. Which is to say that ‘love’ itself is a gamble of sorts.” The director was irked by the romanticism of the falling-in-love template, and had questions about the concept of love, which he says, prompted him to writeIRIR. “Sometimes, people tend to use love as an excuse to hurt each other. How can you hurt somebody you love? When you do, is it love at all? These are some of the questions that bothered me. How can we romanticise love in films, when the reality is far different?”When the trailer forIRIRwas out, there were obvious comparisons to Telugu blockbusterArjun Reddy. However, Ranjit considers himself fortunate that people are comparing his film to a ‘cult movie’. He adds, “You’ll feel inferior only when they compare it with a bad product. Otherwise, it’s good that people are talking about my film. Invariably, there’s a reference for every movie and that’s how we have been tuned. My film has nothing to do withArjun Reddy.”Ranjit describesIRIRas a violent love story. He elaborates, “Violent... in the sense of dominance. More than physical, it’s about the psychological violence that leads to certain unwarranted situations. The hero is violent by nature, while the heroine is kind-hearted. We wanted to show the dichotomy between the characters.” Toxic masculinity has been a recurring phenomenon in films such asArjun Reddy. How has Ranjit handled this factor? “I don’t consider these things while I’m writing. If I start thinking about the critics, I would be failing as a writer. So, they don’t bother me much.”There’s a certain stereotyping when it comes to depicting self-inflicting, sober heroes. Invariably, he sports a bearded look and wears dull shirts. “Beard doesn’t signify ruggedness. The character (Harish Kalyan) doesn’t care about himself and is detached from the world. He is someone who doesn’t even know he has a beard. That was the idea.” From the trailer, the heroine comes across as a bold, independent woman who doesn’t shy away from expressing her sexual feelings. Recently,90MLinvited criticisms for showing women in a poor light. Was Ranjit worried about the socialimpact while etching out the female character? “Not at all.IRIRis more about love than the person. It’s a not a love story, but a story about love. So, there’s no question of gender here.”Even thoughIRIRis his second release, Ranjit believes he has become more mature after what he went through forPuriyatha Puthir, which landed in a financial soup and released after three years in 2017. “When things are beyond your control, you have no other option but to accept them. When the film released, Tamil Nadu was in a state of mourning because of the suicide of Anitha over NEET. After a week, it was removed from theatres,” he says, adding, “Nevertheless, I will be working with Vijay Sethupathi again next year.”You can’t write a film based on its genre. The story has to take shape, which itself is a tedious process"

Can a granular Opposition response be a counter to Prime Minister Modi’s overarching nationalist script, post-Pulwama?
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"So game, set and match to Prime Minister Narendra Modi? With just over two months left for the general election verdict to come in, the predominant sense, whether in the stock market,satta bazaar, street conversations or among pollsters, appears to be that it is all over, bar the shouting. What apparently remains to be seen is whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would breach the majority mark on its own or with the support of its alliance partners.The difference a month makesIt was not like this a month ago. The buzz at the time was that a second term for Mr. Modi was far from being certain. With the Opposition giving the impression of nimble-footed alliances in different States, Mr. Modi and BJP president Amit Shah for once looked beaten in their own ‘always one step ahead’ department.And then the Pulwama suicide terror ambush on Indian soldiers happened, followed by India’s retaliatory bombing of Jaish-e-Mohammad terror base in Balakot in Pakistan, followed in turn by the latter capturing and then returning an Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot. The script changed many times in the stressful days after Pulwama, but at the end of it India had two heroes. One, Abhinandan Varthaman, the captured Wing Commander who returned home to rousing war cries and tales of stellar bravery while in the ‘enemy’ country’s custody. Two, Prime Minister Modi, who, in the words of his fawning followers, among them TV journalists, had done the “unthinkable” and “undoable” in ordering air strikes deep into Pakistan’s territory. In this narration, the last time action had been undertaken targeting Pakistani territory was during the 1971 war, after which a succession of lily-livered Prime Ministers had allowed Pakistan-sponsored terror a free run. A TV anchor gushed that it took just “one man” to shed the pusillanimity of past regimes and show Pakistan its place.Mr. Modi’s daring seemed perfectly timed to take advantage of a slogan the government had coined to advertise its accomplishments:Na mumkin ab mumkin hai(the impossible is possible now). In the hands of Mr. Modi’s adoring party, the slogan transformed into “Modi hai to mumkin hai(if Modi is there, it is possible)”. To nobody’s surprise, the slogan found pride of place on billboards and on the social media timelines of the Prime Minister’s flag-waving fans, some of whom even ensured Twitter trended #SayYesToWar. Mr. Modi’s ‘56-inch chest’, which had receded from sight in the days after the BJP’s defeat in the November 2018 round of State elections, also made a triumphant return while the BJP and the Prime Minister himself blurred the line between the armed forces and the executive.On BJP hoardings, the Prime Minister was featured alongside IAF fighter jets and Wing Commander Varthaman. At a rally in Greater Noida on March 9, Mr. Modi pilloried the “tukde tukde gang” (euphemism for civil society and liberals) for doubting the Balakot air attacks when Pakistan was crying that “Modi aa kar ke maar ke chala gaya(Modi came here and hit us)”. The Election Commission of India has ordered the removal of the offending hoardings, but who will expunge the Prime Minister’s words or stop them from being circulated?That the Prime Minister has a plethora of ways to lampoon his opponents is known, of course. In one of his jibes, he gave a spin to the terms BC and AD, saying these must now be understood as “Before Congress” and “After Dynasty”. By the same token, the BJP’s prospects in 2019 can probably be divided into before and after Pulwama. If preceding the Pulwama attack, the BJP seemed a little lost in contrast to the Opposition’s gung-ho form, the reverse has happened after the terror attack. The BJP has appropriated the nationalist plank, all cylinders firing, leaving the Opposition looking confused and unpatriotic.The BJP has specified the no-go areas: no doubts on the Balakot air strikes, no mention of the intelligence failure that led to the Pulwama massacre, no questions to the Prime Minister or the government, even on the Rafale deal. In a much-publicised interaction with a TV journalist, senior Cabinet Minister Piyush Goyal made it clear that the government, the armed forces and the country were to be accorded the same respect and treated as an indistinguishable whole. And anyone breaching the red lines would be treated as a friend of Pakistan.Adversity to advantageMr. Modi’s record shows an uncanny ability to turn adversity to advantage. He took charge as Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 to almost no indication of the superstardom awaiting him. He scraped through his first ever election held on February 24, 2002 to Rajkot-II, while the BJP lost other byelections held simultaneously. This was three days before the Godhra train carnage. The rest, as they say, is history. All questions on intelligence failure were buried as the State plunged into violence against Muslims. With that Mr. Modi became Gujarat’s Hindu Hriday Samrat, and his career scaled spectacular milestones, paving the way for his eventual rise to Prime Minister.Likewise with the November 8, 2016 demonetisation. The policy was a disaster in the making. Yet in Mr. Modi’s mesmerising words, it became all about sacrifice, valour and nation-building. The crackdown on black money would succeed only with the sacrifice and cooperation of the people, he said, even as he drew a parallel with the “jawan on the border” who took bullets for the nation. The response to this was electric as people standing in queues to exchange their devalued currency parroted the “jawan on the border” line. By the time the severe downside of demonetisation kicked in, the BJP had won its biggest Assembly victory in U.P.Today, the “jawan on the border” is no longer a metaphorical invocation. He is a flesh and blood figure who has shown that he will die for his country. And the BJP is once again calling upon people to rise up and support the armed forces and the government. The election-eve political messaging, conveyed by Mr. Shah and others, is that the country’s security will be in peril if Mr. Modi is defeated.Issues versus slogansThis is not an easy script to counter. From the Opposition, Congress president Rahul Gandhi has shown an unflagging ability to engage with critical issues. He has raised the Rafale deal and hinted at intelligence failure, refusing to be deterred by the government’s faux-nationalist sabre-rattling. But it is clear that the Balakot air strikes have energised the BJP cadre and changed the overall political mood to an extent where defectors to the BJP are positing Mr. Modi’s ‘courage’ against the Opposition’s ‘cowardice'.It seems the BJP’s dismal record on all fronts — sinking economy, debilitating unemployment, farm distress and deepening social fissures — will be forgotten, as the party stitches up smart alliances and wins over estranged partners to deafening drum-beats of nationalism. And yet, the BJP has some hard realities to confront. In U.P. the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, now allies, have each a base vote which adds up to about 40% of the electorate. This has held through ups and downs even in the 2014 election. The same is the case in Karnataka, with the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) now in a pre-poll alliance. The BJP has reached saturation performance in as many as 10 States, and there is only so much it can do to in other States. Can it pull off an encore to the roll of the war drum?Vidya Subrahmaniam is Senior Fellow at The Hindu Centre for Politics and Public Policy"
A classic comes to town,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/a-classic-comes-to-town/article26550265.ece,"
Get set for a bit of absurd realism in Eugene Ionesco’s The Lesson’, presented by DCH this weekend
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Theatre of the Absurd is a moniker given to a genre of post World War-II plays where the premise is a man’s reaction to a world controlled by outside forces.Eugene Ionesco’sThe Lesson, considered one of the classic plays of our times is also one of the most celebrated under the theatre of Absurd. While the play has been performed countless times across the world, Dramatic Circle Hyderabad is bringing this masterpiece to the city which is being helmed by veteran theatre director Pranava Singhal.“While the play was written initially in the context of Nazi Fascism, we have deleted the reference of fascism in this retelling.” notes Singhal and adds, “Our fixed views are generally passed on to the younger generation without giving them a choice of free thought. There is no change of message. There is a lot of bullying of young minds — from the intellectual to the religious which is where this play holds relevance.”While the Dramatic Circle Hyderabad has performed this play in the city nearly 40 years ago, this is the first time that Singhal is captaining the ship and he shares that he hasn’t seen it being performed earlier. Remarking that the genre in which it is set is challenging, the veteran director adds, “The challenge which one faces while doing something like this is that absurd drama by definition itself is not logical. You can lose an audience easily. The trick is to make sense within nonsense, so to speak. Within the absurdity unfolding you have to make sense, so that the message won’t get lost in the absurdity.”For a play under this genre to succeed, the director feels that the onus is on the actors. He explains, “There needs to be strong understanding of the concept not only by the director but also by the actors, only then can the message be conveyed to the audience. The format makes it very interesting as it’s not just another sequential events at play, and the difficult part for the actors is that when the lines are non-sequential they have to work all the more harder. They have to get the lines precisely right.” Singhal has previously worked on other plays under this genre, including another famous play,Waiting for Godotby Samuel Beckett which he acted and co-directed a long time ago.With a run time of 80 minutes,The Lessonchecks all the boxes of an engrossing play, and Singhal says that it is relevant in today’s times. As it has a message for young people, students over 18 years can have a free entry, provided they furnish their ID proof.“The play has a mix of many emotions – sex, violence and humour, and in spite of being an Absurd play, it has a message for everyone watching. It’s very entertaining and of course, being one of the forerunners of the avante garde movement, one of the great classics of our time,” he shares."

Here is a look at other instances when sport, often a tool to propagate the idea of world peace, found itself caught in the crossfire.1972 Munich Olympics: The most gruesome incident of targetted violence against sportsperons happened on September 5, 1972. Eleven Israeli athletes and coaches were taken hostage and eventually murdered by terrorists during a 16-hour ordeal, during which the world was witness to chilling images of athletes held captive on gunpoint.1987 New Zealand cricket tour of Sri Lanka:It was to be a three-Test tour but New Zealand abandoned it after just the first match when a bomb planted by separatists exploded near the team hotel in Colombo, killing 113 civilians.2002 New Zealand cricket tour of Pakistan:New Zealand’s cricket team was touring Pakistan in 2002 when a bomb went off outside their hotel, killing 12 people. The players were unscathed but the Black Caps’ Board decided to call back the team. A year before this, New Zealand was on its way to Pakistan for a series before heading back midway owing to the September 11 terror attack in the USA. The series was eventually abandoned.2009 Sri Lanka cricket tour of Pakistan:The Sri Lankan team was on its way to play what was to be the third day of the second Test against Pakistan at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The team bus was, however, intercepted by at least a dozen terrorists who fired at the bus, resulting in injuries to six Sri Lankan players and the death of the bus driver. Six policemen died protecting the players while two civillians were also killed. The Lankan team returned home and Pakistan has not hosted an international match since then.2010 African Nations Cup Football Tournament:Togo’s national football side was travelling through the Angolan province of Cabinda for the African Nations Cup when the team bus came under gun fire from separatists.

Relatives seek clues by starting informal conversation
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With a zip line, clowns and acrobats, the Missing Persons Search Brigade has turned this gray basketball court into a circus in Escuchapa, in the violent Mexican state of Guerrero.The village is on the long list of places in Mexico that have been devastated by the wave of violence engulfing the country since the government declared war on drug cartels in 2006 and sent the army into the streets. Since then, nearly 2,50,000 people have been murdered. Another 40,000 are missing.There is a bleak objective beneath the colours, laughter and magic of this impromptu circus: persuade elementary school children to share any secrets they might know about where the bodies of the missing are buried around their hometown.Some of its clowns and acrobats are in reality relatives of the “disappeared,” desperately seeking clues about what happened to their loved ones.That means digging through the dirt to find mass graves, but also visiting churches and schools to plead for help from locals — including children, in a part of the country where drug cartels are known to recruit children as lookouts.School children in villages like this are typically all too aware of the violence around them, says Maria Herrera, one of the leaders of the search brigade.‘Very receptive’Children “are very receptive, and have the information we’re looking for,” says Ms. Herrera, 70, who is searching for four missing sons. The circus opens with nearly an hour of jokes and gags. But then it segues into a bitter, inevitable contrast: using pictures of their search sites, the clowns explain why they are there and their work seeking clandestine graves.“We explain how we excavate, and that we are looking for clues,” says Airam Lopez, 29, whose clown make-up hides her pain: she is searching for her husband, who disappeared in 2011.There is a “Peace Box” nearby where the children can leave anonymous drawings or messages with anything they want to tell the clowns."

Signs point to a gunman steeped in far-right Internet culture,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/signs-point-to-a-gunman-steeped-in-far-right-internet-culture/article26550604.ece,"
A white nationalist manifesto believed to have been posted online by the gunman refers to non-whites as ‘invaders’ who threaten to ‘replace’ white people
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A camera mounted to his head, the gunman who livestreamed part of his savage attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday began his video by casually making reference to a current Internet meme.He appeared to be steeped in the culture of the extreme-right Internet. And in the terrible minutes of video that followed, he proved to be a nonchalant, unrepentant killer.As of Friday night, the gunman had not been identified by the authorities. But just before the attack began, a man who said he was a 28-year-old from Australia published a link on a right-wing forum to an 87-page manifesto, and another link on the same forum to a personal Facebook page with the video that would soon document the slaughter.Based on the video, the manifesto and social media posts, a picture has begun to emerge of a man primarily driven by white nationalism and a desire to drive cultural, political and racial wedges between people across the globe. That, he hoped, would stoke discord and, eventually, more violence between races.Australia’s main public broadcaster reported that the Facebook user worked as a personal trainer at a gym in the city of Grafton after finishing school in 2009 until 2011, when he left to travel overseas. Where exactly his travels took him was not immediately known, but the manifesto’s author wrote that he explored much of Europe in the spring of 2017.And a man using the same name visited Gilgit-Baltistan in October, people at two hotels there confirmed.Asghar Khan, the manager of operations at the Serena Hotel there, said the man seemed like a “nature-loving” traveller.Trolling tacticsThe gunman appeared to pair the shooting with the typical trolling tactics of the Internet’s most far-right instigators, playing to a community of like-minded supporters online who cheered him on in real time as they watched bodies pile up.And the manifesto states plainly what usually goes unstated by Internet trolls: by design, its author wanted to get everyone upset and arguing with each other.One of the goals of his bloodshed, he wrote, was to “agitate the political enemies of my people into action, to cause them to overextend their own hand and experience the eventual and inevitable backlash as a result.” He said he wanted to “incite violence, retaliation and further divide”.The manifesto, the video and what appear to be the gunman’s social media posts feature typical white nationalist rhetoric. The gunman seems to have a significant interest in history — at least, the parts that fit into a white nationalist narrative. On his weapons, he wrote the names of centuries-old military leaders who led battles against largely non-white forces, along with the names of men who recently carried out mass shootings of Jews and Muslims.The manifesto refers to non-whites as “invaders” who threaten to “replace” white people.The author says he used guns instead of other weapons because he wanted the U.S. to tear itself apart arguing over gun laws.His choice of language, and the specific memes he referred to, suggest a deep connection to the far-right online community. The link to the livestreamed video was first posted to a forum of 8chan, a notorious far-right space, where the gunman was hailed as a hero after the shooting. Some of his references were subtle. As he drove to the mosque, he listened to a song associated with a 1995 Serbian nationalist video, which has recently been co-opted as a racist meme.NY Times"
‘Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum’ review: disorderly romance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ispade-rajavum-idhaya-raniyum-review-disorderly-romance/article26545729.ece,"
A film that’s just as confused and complicated as the love story it portrays
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The first meeting between Gautham (Harish Kalyan) and Tara (Shilpa Manjunath) isn’t the sort that one would expect after seeing the cutely-in-love kind of posters of the two in the promotional material. He picks a fight with her a few minutes into seeing her for the first time, and drops her into a swimming pool. A little later, she’s in trouble, and he has to save her from some rowdy elements. Ironically, a few months later, when they get to know each other, she saves his number as ‘Rowdy’ on her phone.There’s another nice little scene in the first half, and that’s when the two of them are just getting comfortable with each other. She’s wearing his jacket and bidding him goodbye. He pulls her over for what you think will turn into a ‘moment’. But he says: “Give me back my jacket.” Like he doesn’t care much about her.Ispade Rajavum Idhaya RaniyumGenre: RomanceCast: Harish Kalyan, Shilpa Manjunath, PonvannanStoryline: The romance between a short-tempered guy and an indecisive girlHe soon will –Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum, as the title suggests, pretty much revolves around the dynamics between the two. It’s a format that Kollywood has done before – in films likeVinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa,Neethaane En PonvasanthamandKaatru Veliyidaias well – and Ranjit Jeyakodi’s latest offering is let down by lack of clarity about the complications in the romance.The male lead, Gautham, a veryArjun Reddy-like character, is well performed by Harish Kalyan, but its writing is quite one-dimensional. Gautham is always one to pick up a fight, irrespective of the situation he’s in. He’s surrounded by a group of friends (Bala Saravanan and Ma Ka Pa Anand, whose funny lines don’t create any kind of stir) who make no attempt to stop him from all the violence.Any cinematic attempt at chronicling a complicated relationship, like the one tried here, needs strong leads. It looks like director Ranjit Jeyakodi was quite content with Harish and didn’t bother much about Tara (the female lead, played by Shilpa Manjunath). Tara is a wannabe-Jessie (what Trisha played inVinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa) – but the performance is nowhere near, lacking the different dimensions needed to play the complicated, indecisive female protagonist. Her take on the romance is relatable, but that doesn’t make this insipid romance attractable. The quote that kick-starts the film is: ‘The hottest love has the coldest end’. InIspade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum, the beginning itself is cold... a character is pushed into a swimming pool. The rest of the film is in troubled waters."
The rise of the performance art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/between-the-playful-and-the-political/article26546295.ece,"
Going beyond gallery spaces, the rise of performance art indicates the changing relationship between the spectator and artist ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A crossover genre with multiple influences, performance art continues to be intriguing, strange and full of surprises as it increasingly occupies more space in the arts arena in the country. Often immersive, amusing and rooted in radical acts, performance art is still considered relatively nascent in the Indian contemporary art scene. It eludes definition and sometimes baffles the public, leaving them wondering about what can really be called art. It also indicates the changing relationship between the spectator and artist into a participative and interactive one, going beyond gallery spaces and seeking new venues.Challenging conventionsAt a recent event in Delhi, the first performance art work of the Shalini Passi Art Foundation, curated by Arshiya Lokhandwala, was hosted at the home of the founder – Shalini Passi, over lunch. A gathering of guests waited and watched as the banner switched, declaring:Lunch is Cancelled. After a short while, accompanied by a band of servers, performance artist Mithu Sen marched out of the house, announcing instructions in gibberish. All were dressed in uniforms matched with a protective pet cone around the neck. The host’s pet, a black pug, was also part of the procession, elaborately adorned with ornaments and settled in a baby carriage. As an act of ‘radical hospitality’, the servers settled at the table and proceeded to feed themselves awkwardly through the cones, while the guests watched.Artist Mithu Sen  
| Photo Credit:S_Subramanium“For me, it is important to poke and disturb conventional power structures in my performances,” reflects the artist, “the concept of radical hospitality exposes the relationship between the host and guests as one that is farcical and stems from the power dynamic at play.” Radical hospitality has emerged as a powerful trope in Sen’s work over the years. It initially sparked up as a theme at a residency in New York where she invited people to visit her while she was making art, put up the show in her apartment and disappeared on the opening day, squarely challenging the institution of hospitality and the artifice it involves.ForLunch is Cancelled, Sen noticed that the dog is an important member of the Passi household, and decided to use the dog collar as a metaphor for the irony of social relationships. “It is not just lunch that is cancelled, but the guest-host relationship, tolerance level, and hospitality all get troubled in the performance. The human beings at the table attempt to eat with a dog collar, foregoing their table manners, and the irony is that the collar is actually used to prevent dogs from eating!”Sen’s works include paintings, performance art, and installations, exploring themes around social and cultural identities. Though an accomplished poet, Sen has chosen to use ‘non-language’ as a powerful and recurring tool in her performance works. “The act of un-languaging is a way for me to undo myself and avoid being bracketed into a system or identity. People don’t understand what I am saying, but I am still engaging people and challenging them to look at meaning in various ways.”Radical movesThe innate ambiguity of what has alternately been termed performance art, conceptual art, and live art, is a characteristic feature of the genre. The absence of a specific structure and the ability to move across artistic medium has made performance art an open yet challenging experience to engage with. Emphasising the intense experience of the live presence of the artist, Sen reflects, “The body is where physical life and identities are experienced. In performance, there is a risk, and there is freedom.” Moving away from structures of the visual art gallery, performance art has emerged as a radical practice of pain, protest, and politics in a post-studio scenario. “It is a medium where the artist can be critical of the art market and also elude it,” says Sen.On the other hand, unlike the narrative structures of drama and theatre, the unpredictability of performance largely lies in its aversion to script and rehearsal. Improvisation and participation emerge as pivotal elements leading a performance work. Renowned performance artist Inder Salim says, “Performance art is a term that keeps on revealing but does not tell us exactly what it is. It is open to different interpretations – constantly opening up to newer possibilities and ideas. It is never a single, monochromatic brush stroke. Performance art can be seen as a haze, mixing different dust, through which we see a fraction; a state where we constantly confuse ourselves.”The artist adopted his performance pseudonym ‘Inder Salim’ to reflect a hybrid cultural identity. He uses the term ‘harkat’ for his performance art pieces. The term literally means ‘act’ or ‘escapade’. He points out that the term is culture-specific, it adds up to indicate a “little action, something mischievous, an act that has the potential to dislodge, that can outwit, that can arrive at an intervention, pass by silently or in an unpredictable way.” The artist’s interpretation focuses on the two cornerstones of performance art—play and politics.Moving the audiencePerformance art seeks to effectively transform the dynamics between the artist and the audience. From passive viewers in an art gallery or spectators in a theatre show, the audience become active participants or collaborators in most performance art works. The works are usually engaging, interactive, often meant to disturb people to come out of their comfort zones to think, act and explore their own mind.In a recent performance at the India Art Fair, artist Amol K. Patil’s work challenged social discrimination. Curated by Sitara Chowfla, his performance involved street sweepers and other workers from Dalit communities. The artist says, “I chose to invite them because the people who do these jobs are mostly regarded as untouchable.” The participants blew soap bubbles in the open-air space, while the attendees mostly played with the bubbles without paying attention to the caste identities of the performers who were blowing the bubbles. “The performance was intended to be welcoming, extending an invitation to the bystanders to join and enjoy playing with the bubbles, at the same time it addressed issues of untouchability and social hierarchy. The art world is not just for one particular class and should encourage diversity and tolerance.”Patil, a trained visual artist from Mumbai, decided to explore the genre of performance art after being deeply moved as a participant in a series of workshop sessions by renowned performance artist Nikhil Chopra a few years ago. He searched out the old Marathi scripts written by his late father, an activist and theatre artist, moulding them as material for his performance art work, aligning personal memories with larger political questions.The connections between theatre and performance art are finely balanced yet divergent. While both are anchored in the live presence of the performer, drama finds its source in a script while performance art negates the idea of a rehearsed narrative altogether. Drawn into this dilemma between the two genres, Patil recalls a period when he stopped performing for a while since he was torn about his approach to the work. For him, “theatre is about story-telling, while performance art is about creating situations.” Reflecting on the process of creating a performance art work he says, “I have a basic concept and structure in mind but I never practice or rehearse my performances. The body adapts itself into different public spaces and this has to be spontaneous, it cannot be determined earlier.”Challenging identitiesArts patron Shalini Passi on supporting performance artMost artists believe that the ‘realness’ of performance art works can address concerns about daily life issues that we often avoid talking about as a community. Nagpur-based Shweta Bhattad is known for taking up themes related to gender violence and abuse. Her performance art work series titledFaithwas staged at inconceivable venues ranging from garbage dumps and iron mines to construction sites and in-the-air hoardings. Reflecting on her work on female foeticide she says, “I did this performance for each girl child who is murdered, dumped in landfills, drains, garbage and hence I decided to do this performance in a garbage space at Nagpur in a large clear bag full of air, which was in the form of chocolate wrapping to make the statement that the female body is not a product of sale like goods or entertainment. There is ‘faith’ that one-day people will change their perception of women and this world will become a better place for a woman to live freely, with all the respect, individuality, equality that a human being deserves.” In this performance, Bhattad remained inside the bag as the perplexed bystanders were invited to watch or join her in writing the word ‘faith’ on the walls of the bag.In another work, she revisited the image of ‘Bharat Mata’ and addressed the issue of fear that resides in a woman’s body as she moves around the city. “We need to think about why women are still so scared in public spaces in cities and the causes of gender violence. As a woman, I feel this fear in my body and I want people to think about what it would take for an Indian woman to feel fearless and free on the streets.”The disruptive, dramatic and chronic state of confusion produced by performance art is creating new equations between the artists and viewers. The artistic explorations are led by a search for new idioms of expression that would question, challenge, and open up dialogues on politics, society, and culture.What is the significance of performance work being the first one for the Foundation?The Foundation is poised to articulate the avant-garde as a trope to critically look at emergent new practices within art, fashion, design, craft, architecture and jewellery. The performance perfectly fit to question the ideas with the spectrum of hospitality that disrupts the relationship between the guest and host. Therefore,Lunch is Cencelledserved as a suitable opening for the Foundation and what it aspires to do.What kind of performance art works can we look forward to at the Foundation in the future?The whole beauty of performance art is exploring the interaction between artist and audience – then the response of the viewer becomes critical to the piece, causing it to take on unexpected new forms, which, of course, causes the audience to react further. Prior to Mithu's performance, we revealed very little about what it would entail; it was so fun to watch the reactions of the guests as Mithu led this marching band of performers around them!What, in your opinion, is the importance of performance art within the larger framework of contemporary art in India?Performance is a particularly interesting subject to explore in India, given that the systematic performance of rituals is so deeply embedded in our culture. But I would say that the idea of performance as art is not yet widely understood or acknowledged. That's not to say it's new – Bhupen Khakhar was challenging the conventional interaction between artist and audience in the early 1970s! However, it is something that has developed on wider scale in more recent years, and I hope it will continue to do so. It was great to see performances by artists such as Amol Patil at India Art Fair; I’m so pleased the Fair used this platform to showcase more subversive and unexpected work like this."

New Zealand mosque shooter a white supremacist angry at immigrants,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-zealand-mosque-shooter-a-white-supremacist-angry-at-immigrants/article26548247.ece,"
That rampage killed at least 41 people, while an attack on a second mosque in the city not long after killed several more.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The gunman behind at least one of the mosque shootings in New Zealand that left 49 people dead on Friday tried to make a few things clear in the manifesto he left behind — He is a 28-year-old Australian white nationalist who hates immigrants. He was angry about attacks in Europe that were perpetrated by Muslims. He wanted revenge, and he wanted to create fear.Though he claimed not to covet fame, the gunman whose name was not immediately released by police left behind a 74-page document posted on social media under the name Brenton Tarrant in which he said he hoped to survive the attack to better spread his views in the media.That rampage killed at least 41 people, while an attack on a second mosque in the city not long after killed several more. Police did not say whether the same person was responsible for both shootings.While his manifesto and video were an obvious and contemptuous ploy for infamy, they do contain important clues for a public trying to understand why anyone would target dozens of innocent people who were simply spending an afternoon engaged in prayer.There could be no more perplexing a setting for a mass slaughter than New Zealand, a nation so placid and so isolated from the mass shootings that plague the U.S. that police officers rarely carry guns.Yet the gunman himself highlighted New Zealand’s remoteness as a reason he chose it. He wrote that an attack in New Zealand would show that no place on earth was safe and that even a country as far away as New Zealand is subject to mass immigration.“I can’t ... believe that somebody I’ve probably had daily dealings with and had shared conversations and interacted with would be able of something to this extreme,” Tracey Gray told theAustralian Broadcasting Corp.The rambling manifesto is filled with confusing and seemingly contradictory assertions about his beliefs.Beyond his white nationalistic ideals, he claimed to be an environmentalist and said he is a fascist who believes China is the nation that most aligns with his political and social values. He said he has contempt for the wealthiest 1 percent. And he singled out American conservative commentator Candace Owens as the person who had influenced him the most, while saying “the extreme actions she calls for are too much, even for my tastes.”In a tweet, Owens responded by saying that if the media portrayed her as the inspiration for the attack, it had better hire lawyers.The manifesto also included a single reference to President Donald Trump in which the author asked and answered the question of whether he was a Trump supporter: “As a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure. As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no.”Throughout the manifesto, the theme he returns to most often is conflict between people of European descent and Muslims, often framing it in terms of the Crusades.Among his hate-filled statements is a claim that he was motivated toward violence by an episode that occurred in 2017 while he was touring through Western Europe. That was when an Uzbek man drove a truck into a crowd of people in Stockholm, killing five.Three months ago, he said, he started planning to target Christchurch. He said he has donated to many nationalist groups, but claimed not to be a direct member of any organization. However, he admitted contacts with an anti-immigration group called the reborn Knights Templar and said he got the approval of Anders Breivik for the attack, a claim that has not been verified.The gunman rambled on about the supposed aims for the attack, which included reducing immigration by intimidating immigrants and driving a wedge between NATO and the Turkish people. He also said he hoped to further polarize and destabilize the West, and spark a civil war in the United States that would ultimately result in a separation of races. The attack has had the opposite impact, with condemnation of the bloodshed pouring in from all quarters of the globe, and calls for unity against hatred and violence.The gunman used various hate symbols associated with the Nazis and white supremacy. For instance, the number 14 is seen on his rifle, a possible reference to the “14 Words,” a white supremacist slogan attributed in part to Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf,” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also used the symbol of the Schwarze Sonne, or black sun, which “has become synonymous with myriad far-right groups who traffic in neo-Nazi,” according to the center."
"'Aamis' is about restrictions imposed on love, says Bhaskar Hazarika",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-two-deadly-sins/article26543714.ece,"
Love and food, lust and gluttony become intertwined themes in this disturbing and tender Assamese film
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"At first glance, Bhaskar Hazarika’s second feature film,Aamis(Ravening), is nothing like his debutKothanodi.While he drew from Assamese folk tales (Burhi AairSadhuor Grandma’s Tales, a compendium of 20-odd stories by Rasaraj Lakshminath Bezbaroa) for his first film, which was shot in rural Majuli,Aamisis his own script andset in contemporary, urban Guwahati. But both films are similar in their complex and thought-provoking portrayal of unusual, almost forbidden, relationships and fallible individuals — especially women — struggling with their personal demons.Out of the blueHazarika tells us there is nothing planned about the subjects he picks for his films. The idea forAamiscame to him, out of the blue, when he saw a couple in a food court sharing a plate of fried chicken. “They were deeply engrossed in the food. They were connected not because they were talking but because they were eating together. It made me think of this crazy plot,” he says. What has emerged is a unique film. It is in the realm of horror, is bizarre, shocking and subversive. It is ominously genteel when it comes to the world it is located in, disturbingly gentle in its telling, and menacingly mellow in its narrative.All of this only accentuates the violence and the violations embedded deep within the seemingly regular, possibly sinister, situation.Aamiswill have its world première at the upcoming Tribeca Film Festival.Director Bhaskar HazarikaAamisis about restrictions imposed on love and how it can lead to people embracing their darker side. “Love is the central pillar holding up the experience of being human. Yet, whom you can love is limited by bewildering range of boundaries — class, caste, religion, age, nationality and gender,” reads the director’s statement. So we have Nirmali, a doctor, and Sumon, a Ph.D. student, bonding over food — a variety of fresh, organic and exotic meat that he introduces her to. Their passion deepens in their discovery of food but the possibility of togetherness eludes them; she is older, married and the mother of a child.A proxy for desireFrom playing Cupid, food turns into a proxy for desire. Making food for a beloved, a lover relishing it, become expressions of longing. Eating together is a rebellion of sorts and also a consummation. Lust and hunger are basic instincts. So gluttony runs parallel to the immense craving for love. Everything gets centred on a mundane lunchbox.A denial of the fundamental flavours of life only leads to perverse addictions. “It’s how you often end up eating a lot if you can’t have the one you love… Repression finds a way out. It could be alcohol, cocaine,” says Hazarika. From the everyday to the exotic to the taboo — it’s a journey to transgression and depravity when it comes to both food and desire. And food that nurtures and fills the many voids in life also eventually becomes a font of nihilism and transgressions. He says he did not want the film to provoke, but neither is the film about ultra beautified food a la Instagram.Universal themeThen there is the anthropology of food, food histories and tradition — the unusual variety of meats people eat the world over. How one man’s basic diet can seem abnormal to another. But can any food be ‘abnormal’? Can any love be ‘illicit’? “Aamisis not designed to carry any message other than empathy for those who make terrible choices in the pursuit of love,” says Hazarika. There is something universal in the theme of food. As Hazarika says, around the world, cities have begun to resemble each other and offer a similar anonymity when it comes to love, food or sexting.He then talks about cinema in Assam. The only way it can survive, he says, is by looking beyond the 40-odd halls in the State to a bigger market. “The films need to be made locally but on global themes.” He wants filmmaking in the Northeast to break out of the ‘insurgency’ paradigm.His first film was made with ₹21.5 lakh raised from crowd funding. This time he has two producers and co-producer. “We left no place untouched in Guwahati. It must be the first film shot in sync sound in the noisy city,” he says.Hazarika picked an interesting assortment for the cast. Lead actor Lima Das, who plays Nirmali, is a dentist in real life and a proponent of the Assamese dance form Sattriya. The male lead Arghadeep Barua (who has an uncanny resemblance to Hazarika ) is a popular musician with the group Bottle Rockets in Gurgaon; he was discovered just a couple of weeks before the shoot. All the actors were put through their paces in an intensive acting workshop held by actor Seema Biswas.The film has been at the 2017 Asian Cinema Fund’s co-production market in Busan and at the 2017 NFDC Film Bazaar. Hazarika tells us about the programmer of a big festival who had read his proposal and expected a harsher, darker film. But Hazarika has always believed in the power of the oblique. “I think the more you show, the less provocative things become,” he says. He found his unit, cast and crew responding to the story with sympathy rather than with disgust. Tenderness and transgressions get curiously entwined. “I had initially titled itBeautiful Sick… there’s something beautiful around even the shittiest gutter in the world.”[email protected]"

The response from some Muslim countries went further, blaming politicians and the media for stoking that hatred.“I blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9/11 (where) 1.3 billion Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror,” Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan wrote on social media.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said the attack was a result of Muslims being demonised. “Not only the perpetrators, but also politicians & media that fuel the already escalated Islamophobia and hate in the West are equally responsible for this heinous attack,” he tweeted.Protests in DhakaHundreds of angry protesters in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, chantedAllahu akbar!(God is Greatest) after Friday prayers.“We will not let the blood of Muslims go in vain,” said one protester. Members of the Bangladesh national cricket team, in Christchurch for a match against New Zealand, had arrived for Friday prayers as the shooting started but were not injured.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said some of the victims may have been new immigrants or refugees. “They are us,” she said. “The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand.”Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, who is New Zealand’s head of state, said she was “deeply saddened by the appalling events”. Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim Mayor of London, said Londoners stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of Christchurch. He also pointed his finger at those who promote religious hatred. The Palestinian chief peace negotiator, Saeb Erekat, called the attack a “consequence of racist ideologies that continue trying to promote religious wars”."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Bangladesh cricket team escaped unhurt and was not even the target but violence has been specifically directed at sportspersons in the past, leading to bloody repercussions. Here is a look at instances when sport, often a tool to propagate the idea of world peace, found itself caught in the crossfire.1972 Munich OlympicsThe most gruesome incident of targetted violence against sportsperons happened onSeptember 5, 1972.Eleven Israeli athletes and coaches were taken hostage and eventually murdered by terrorists during a 16-hour ordeal, during which the world was witness to chilling images of athletes held captive on gunpoint.1987 New Zealand tour of Sri Lanka (cricket)It was to be a three-Test tour but New Zealand abandoned it after just the first match when a bomb planted by separatists exploded near theteam hotel in Colombo, killing 113 civilians.2002 New Zealand tour of Pakistan (cricket)New Zealand’s cricket team was touringPakistan in 2002when a bomb went off outside their hotel, killing 12 people. The players were unscathed but the Black Caps’ Board decided to call back the team. A year before this, New Zealand were on their way to Pakistan for a series before heading back midway owing to the September 11 terror attack in the USA. The series was eventually abandoned.2009 Sri Lanka tour of Pakistan (cricket)The Sri Lankan team was on its way to play what was to be the third day of the second Test against Pakistan at theGaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The team bus was, however, intercepted by at least a dozen terrorists who fired at the bus, resulting in injuries to six Sri Lankan players and the death of the bus driver. Six policemen died protecting the players while two civillians were also killed. The Lankan team returned home and Pakistan has not hosted an international match since then.2010 African Nations Cup Football TournamentTogo’s national football side was travelling through theAngolan province of Cabindafor the African Nations Cup when the team bus came under gun fire from separatists. The side’s assistant manager and media officer were killed in the attack.2019 Bangladesh tour of New Zealand (cricket)A day before the start of what was to be the third and final Test of the tour,Bangladesh’s cricket team was on its way for Friday prayers at the Masjid Al Noor mosquein Christchurch, which was to be followed by a practice session. The mosque came under attack from a gunman, identified as an Australian extremist, and led to the killing 49 people. The players remained safe but the tour was called off."
From revolutions to roses: on Women's Day,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/from-revolutions-to-roses/article26537197.ece,"
Women’s Day should be an occasion to ponder over how much more is to be done for gender justice ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"OnWomen’s Daythis year, messages clogged my inbox. They offered tempting discounts in salons, on shoes, clothes and cosmetics, and even complimentary cocktails. Despite women organising seminars on finance, sexual harassment and health problems across the country, tokenistic marketing threatened to reduce the day to hashtags and discounts.The irony and historyOn the International Women’s Day 2019 website, the partners included McDonald’s, Amazon and Oracle. McDonald’s is facing flak in the U.S. for failing to pay its largely female workforce the minimum wage, Amazon is reported to have a huge gender diversity problem, and Oracle is facing a civil rights suit that alleges female employees were paid on average $13,000 less per year than men doing similar work. All three were apparently in support of the 2019 campaign theme, ‘Better the balance, better the world’.The irony of all this is particularly rich given that International Women’s Day has its origins in socialism. German socialist and feminist Clara Zetkin, who organised the first International Women’s Day, was a socialist first and a feminist next. In the magazineDie Gleichheit(Equality), Zetkin wrote in 1894: “Bourgeois feminism and the movement of proletarian women are two fundamentally different social movements.” Zetkin held that “bourgeois feminists” were not concerned with the conditions of working class women who were fighting not only against men who sought to suppress them, but also with men against a common oppressor, capitalism. She believed that as white, upper class feminists would only fight to better their own conditions, socialism was the only way to serve the needs of working class women.Also ReadStop celebrating Women’s DayZetkin suggested in the Second International Conference of Socialist Women at Copenhagen in 1910 that Women’s Day be celebrated each year, the foremost purpose of which would be “to aid the attainment of women’s suffrage”. The timing for the proposal was ideal — a year earlier, the Socialist Party in the U.S. had also suggested that a National Women’s Day be observed, in honour of a strike that took place in 1908. More than 15,000 women garment workers fought for higher wages and shorter working hours in that strike.Following Zetkin’s proposal, International Women’s Day was observed in a few European countries on March 19, commemorating the 1848 Revolution in Prussia when a people’s uprising had forced the king to promise women the right to vote, which he later failed to keep.But the day became truly revolutionary only later. In Russia, protests erupted on March 8, 1917, against World War I and brought down the Tsarist Empire. The new government gave the women the right to vote. International Women’s Day was thus a day of resistance and demand. The reason the UN observed the day only decades later, from 1975 onwards, was because the Americans were aware of — and wary of — its origins in socialism.Over the decades, women’s demands have varied across cultures. In India, for instance, following the anti-colonial and social reform movement, the Constitution guaranteed justice, dignity and equality for women. However, these values came in conflict with old patriarchal values, thus limiting women’s progress. The women’s movement became fragmented, only to see a resurgence in the 1970s after the Emergency when there was a rallying cry for civil rights. This led to the birth of several women’s organisations, which successfully pushed for legal reforms. The women’s movement slowly regained strength, fighting against dowry deaths, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. However, it never really appreciated the struggles of Dalit and Bahujan women.Issues in IndiaOn this March 8, in some parts of the world (mostly Latin America and Europe), women continued to do what women in the early ’90s did — protest. In India, however, several companies with gender diversity and pay gap problems celebrated the day, despite the alarming trend of more and more women withdrawing from the workforce (female participation in the workforce fell from 42.7% in 2004-05 to 23.3% in 2017-18). WhatsApp forwards continued to celebrate women as mothers, daughters and sisters who are able to multi-task effortlessly, underlining the widespread belief that it is acceptable for women to work as long as they also carry out their traditional duties at home. Given the huge inequality in the treatment and payment of women workers, and with labour conditions being unfriendly to women, it is important to ask what really women want on this day: roses or reforms?Instead of celebrating women, companies would do well to reflect on how they treat their women: is their pay on a par with men? Are sexual harassment cells in place and do they function? Are there crèches at workplaces? And what about the informal sector, the working class women, who are not represented by “bourgeois feminists”? How do we consolidate various women’s movements across classes and castes?In an increasingly unequal world, March 8 gives us the opportunity to ask ourselves how much more is to be done and how it is to be accomplished. Instead of allowing a day rooted in protest to be taken over by consumerism, women could mobilise around specific issues — better sanitation facilities and better wages — and make sustained demands for effective change in their conditions.[email protected]"
NGO demands law to curb discrimination against children in government schools,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ngo-demands-law-to-curb-discrimination-against-children-in-government-schools/article26537964.ece,"
Move comes in the wake of increasing instances of caste bias in schools ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Social Awareness Society for Youths (SASY), a non-governmental organisation, has urged the State government to enact a law to curb discrimination and violence against children in educational institutions in the wake of increasing instances of caste bias against children studying in government schools coming to light in the State.According to a fact-finding report by SASY, though the affected students from the Dalit community reported the discriminatory practices perpetuated against them to the school authorities, no action was taken by them. The victims’ statements were often negated resulting in high number of dropouts from the schools.No action takenAccording to I. Pandian, executive director of SASY, three incidents of caste-based discrimination were reported against Dalit children in government schools in Virudhunagar, Cuddalore and Villupuram districts in the last one month.In the first incident reported on February 25, Isaikala, a Plus Two student from the Seithur Sevuka Government Higher Secondary School in Seithur, Virudhunagar district, was subjected to physical and verbal abuse by her peers belonging to a Backward Classes community in southern Tamil Nadu. They called her by caste namesand she was thrashed and beaten up by the students inside a toilet.Though a complaint was lodged by Isaikala’s parents, no action was taken against the students, Mr. Pandian said.Similarly, Dalit students in the Karaikadu Government Higher Secondary School in Cuddalore were subjected to continuous caste bias by students belonging to a Most Backward Classes community in the northern region. Though the affected girl students reported the incident to the school authorities on several occasions, no action was taken.Mr. Pandian said that in the third incident, L. Kamal, a differently-abled Plus One student from the Kadavampakkam Government Higher Secondary School, was subjected to severe corporal punishment by teachers.“A few of his classmates were playing with paper rockets during the interval, when Kamal pulled the paper rocket and threw it out of the window. However, the student was verbally and physically assaulted by four teachers,” he said.The fact-finding report revealed that Dalit students were subjected to various forms of identity-based discrimination and abuses, resulting in four students dropping out of school.Need for sensitisationSASY has demanded the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) and the National Commission on Scheduled Castes (NCSC) to visit the schools and take action against caste discrimination. The government should enact a law to curb caste-based discrimination, they have demanded.While children cannot be criminalised and held responsible for caste-based remarks, the legislation could look at mainstreaming the children and building harmony among them. It is more of a sensitisation process, Mr. Pandian added."

Move to ‘expel’ Lambada tribes from the list of Scheduled Tribes fizzles out
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Even the initiation of Parliamentary election process has not given a boost to the Adivasi campaign in erstwhile united Adilabad district to elect a candidate who vows unstinted support for their nearly one-and-a-half-year old movement to expel Lambada tribes from the list of Scheduled Tribes.Whatever was left of the enthusiasm to elect a sympathetic leader clearly got lost in the post-Assembly election scenario, putting the movement in a limbo.The struggle started in the second half of 2017 across the State but was strongest in these parts and even witnessed violence in November that year.The Adivasi Hakkula Porata Samiti, better known as Tudum Debba, spearheaded the agitation under the leadership of Soyam Bapu Rao its State president and Athram Sakku.Sakku to join TRSBapu Rao and Sakku contested the December 11 election on Congress party tickets from Boath (ST) and Asifabad (ST) constituencies but the former lost and latter won with a slender majority.Mr. Sakku has since declared that he will join the TRS, which is seen as a cause for weakening the cause of the aboriginal people.The movement however began subsiding, which is alternately considered as restoration of normalcy in the Agency areas, during the gram panchayat election in January. The election threw up some surprises like ethnic voters agreeing to elect a Lambada contestant unanimously as Betalguda sarpanch in Narnoor mandal of Adilabad district.Defiling of statueBetalguda it was which was central to the incident of defiling the statue of Raj Gond martyr Kumram Bheem, allegedly by Lambada miscreants, which sparked violence in the Agency tracts in November 2017.Next came the apparent failure of the plan of Tudum Debba to stage a national-level protest in support of their demand in New Delhi on February 11, evidently because it did not evoke proper response.SC verdictThis was followed by Lambada farmers rubbing shoulders with their aboriginal counterparts and participating in a dharna in front of the collectorate organised by Tudum Debba on March 1 to protest against the Supreme Court judgment of February 13 ordering eviction of tribals from forests.Santh Sevalal JayantiThe biggest surprise, nevertheless, came on March 4.A few Tudum Debba leaders from Indervelli mandal, who were more vociferous and in the forefront of the movement last year, helped the Lambada community members celebrate Santh Sevalal Jayanti at a spot in the mandal headquarter which become an irritant for the Adivasis as the Lambada religious flag was hoisted there last year.“In the light of these incidents, I thought it better to stay away from an active role for some time,” announced another important leader of the movement from Indervelli mandal which contributes for the movement staying in a limbo."

Individually read, the judgments typify the deep penological confusion that pervades India’s criminal justice system. Collectively, the cases demonstrate how arbitrary the death penalty is, how its application is mired by a belief in conflicting values, and how the fundamental requirement of precision in criminal law has been replaced by a rhetorical cry for avenging crime by invoking the “collective conscience” of society.Conjecture and farceIn the first of the cases,Digamber Vaishnav v. State of Chhattisgarh, two persons were convicted of murdering five women and were sentenced to death in 2014. A year later, the Chhattisgarh High Court affirmed these sentences. But the chief testimony, which formed the backbone of the prosecution’s case, was that of a nine-year-old child, who was, shockingly, not even an eye-witness to the crime.

State of Maharashtra, the second of the cases, saw a gut-wrenching series of events being reduced to macabre farce. In 2006, a trial court found six persons guilty of rape and murder and sentenced each of them to death. A year later, the Bombay High Court confirmed the finding of guilt, but commuted the sentences imposed on three of the individuals to life imprisonment. However, in 2009, the Supreme Court not only dismissed the appeals filed by those sentenced to death, but also, astonishingly, enhanced the penalties of the three persons whose sentences had been commuted by ordering that they too be punished with death. In doing so, the court relied on a 1996 verdict, inRavji v.

Although in May 2009, the Supreme Court had declared its earlier ruling inRavjiincorrect, by holding that even in those cases where the crime is brutal and heinous the criminal’s antecedents, including his economic and social background, must have a bearing on the award of the sentence, it took until October last year for the court to recall its order sentencing the six persons to death.During this time, as the court records, “The accused remained under constant stress and in the perpetual fear of death.” What is more, one of them, who was later found to be a juvenile at the time when the alleged crime was committed, was kept in solitary confinement. He was not allowed to meet any of the other prisoners and was only allowed an occasional meeting with his mother. For their troubles — for having spent more than a decade on death row despite having committed no crime — the bench ordered that the state pay each of them a sum of ₹5 lakh. But while the court was quick to apportion blame on the prosecution, it didn’t so much as mention its own errors and its own proclivity to mirror the mentality of a mob.A ‘rarest of rare’ caseYet, we might have been forgiven for thinking that the court’s experience in hearingDigamber Vaishnavand, especially,Ankush Maruti Shindemay have made it more circumspect in upholding death sentences.

There, the court declared Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, which prescribes the death penalty for murder, as constitutionally valid, but bounded its limits by holding that the punishment can only be prescribed in the rarest of rare cases. Since then, the court has repeatedly cautioned that capital punishment ought to only be decreed when the state can clearly establish that a convict is incapable of being reformed and rehabilitated. But, inKhushwinder Singh, the court does not place on record any such piece of evidence that the state was called on to produce.

The Death Penalty India Report (DPIR), released on May 6, 2016, by Project 39A of the National Law University, Delhi, for example, shows that 74% of prisoners on death row, at the time of the study, were economically vulnerable, and 63% were either the primary or sole earners in their families. More than 60% of those sentenced to death had not completed their secondary school education, and 23% had never attended school, a factor which, as the report states, “points to the alienation that they would experience from the legal process, in terms of the extent to which they are able to understand the case against them and engage with the criminal justice system.” Just as distressingly, 76% of those sentenced to death belonged to backward classes and religious minorities, including all 12 female prisoners.In the face of this invidiously prejudiced application, the retention of capital punishment utterly undermines the country’s moral foundations.

Will a court-mandated mediation on Ayodhya solve the issue?,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/will-a-court-mandated-mediation-on-ayodhya-solve-the-issue/article26537219.ece,"
The Supreme Court’s attempt at mediation has its share of supporters and critics ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court has opted for a time-bound mediation process in a bid to resolve the Ayodhya dispute.Sukumar MuralidharanandSanjay Hegdedebate whether mediation is necessary at this stage, and if the process is viable, in a discussion moderated by K. Venkataramanan.Excerpts:Is mediation viable at this stage of the litigation, when the Supreme Court is set to begin the final hearing in the Ayodhya dispute? Is it advisable and desirable?Sukumar Muralidharan: I think the Supreme Court has stepped in as a problem-solver at numerous stages of this dispute over the years. And sometimes it has declined to play that role — instances being as far back as in 1989, when it was asked to put a stop to the Shila Pujans that were going on all over the country and causing a lot of communal violence, and it declined to do so; and then again in 1992, when it was asked to ensure the safety of the structure when the Vishva Hindu Parishad was planning its kar seva on December 6, 1992. Of course, it did issue a writ and asked for guarantees to the safety of the structure. The rest is history. Then, the reference was made to determine whether there was a Hindu religious structure under the mosque prior to the mosque being built. The Supreme Court declined to hear it but held that the acquisition of the land was good in law. And that a mosque was not part of essential religious practice for the Islamic faith and, hence, there was no violation of religious freedom in the acquisition of that land. It then reverted the case to the Lucknow Bench for a determination of the title suit. So, that’s what we had coming out in 2010. This mediation decision comes out of an appeal against the Lucknow Bench’s decision. So, I think this fits in with the normal course of adjudication in the matter. The mediation decision is the court, in a manner of speaking, abdicating its responsibility.Click here to listen to the podcastSanjay Hegde:Any court always has the option of asking parties to mediate before it proceeds to adjudicate. That is laid down in the Civil Procedure Code. This is a kind of case where even if there is adjudication, the court is not particularly sure as to whether its verdict would be honoured if it is unpopular on one side or the other. However, the court decided to be proactive, not in the sense of abdicating its jurisdiction, but is aware now that mediation itself is a specialised process. It is not exactly in the sense of a negotiating or bargaining kind of situation. Mediation is something much deeper and the court wants to see whether that process with the trained mediator plus two others who are of repute within the community, both legally as well as in terms of a broader religious appeal... they’ve tried to get some kind of representational team together. And see where the process goes.There is a small window of eight weeks for mediation. Would it have been better if the mediation process was given more time, or if it was open-ended so that there could be a more viable process?S.H.:If you give too much time, nothing really happens. So, having a deadline also concentrates parties’ minds wonderfully, inasmuch as there is time pressure to arrive at a solution.S.M.:My worry is that the court has opted for a deadline that just puts it over the threshold of the electoral cycle, so that it does not get affected by the heat and dust of the election campaign. Now, it may be prudent to have done this, but I don’t see that the court should really be allowing this political scenario to impinge upon its decision. Now, once the mediation begins, who will the mediators involve in the process? There are a number of litigants involved. The original litigants are the Nirmohi Akhara, the Wakf Board, and there is Ram Lalla, the deity. But the VHP is creating trouble on the streets, and they have become, by virtue of their coercive politics, litigants in the problem. So, who are going to be part of the mediation? It’s going to be a tricky process because whoever is left out of the mediation process can move out to the streets with their grievance, and whip up public fury.The suits are representative in nature with the two communities on either side of the dispute. It is said it will be difficult to enforce a decree of the court, if one party expresses misgivings and the other party is happy about it. Does this not apply to the mediation process also?S.H.:A negotiated settlement will also ultimately end up in a decree of the court. What will happen on the enforcement of the decree is another question. Right now, we are wondering whether the decree can be arrived at by consensus among the parties to the litigation, or whether the decree has to be arrived at only through the adjudicatory route.Do you agree with the basic formulation — that this is a matter concerning faith and not merely the civil rights of the respective parties?S.M.:There’s so much of politics riding on this. They [the Muslim parties] say they are willing to cede the land if it is proven that it was taken by fraud or by force from the other side. And the other side is arguing, ‘No, it is a matter of faith, and we cannot negotiate, or have a judicial determination on a matter of faith.’ I don’t see any reason why they will retreat from that really hard-line position now, without risk of loss of face, since it has become such a high-stakes issue politically. The judiciary could have just proceeded to take the bull by the horn, rather than bring in the question of faith and the emotion.Do you get the sense that the legal issues are secondary?S.H.:Politically, it has always been framed like that. How does the judiciary handle it? The judiciary could have well said, ‘Look there are no manageable standards,’ and declined to get into the dispute altogether. Or, it could have said, ‘We have no space for faith and belief out here. Let us go simply by the law as laid down.’ The mosque has stood there for nearly 500 years, and we all saw this go down in 1992. How does, in the face of all that evidence, one side prove title?There are two basic emotions out here. One emotion on the Hindu side is, ‘We have suffered religious hurt and we have lived with it through 500 years. This may not be a Hindu state, but it is a Hindu majority country. The wishes of the majority on this thing must prevail.’ On the Muslim side, it is this emotion that, ‘Look, we are not intruders. These are things that have happened so many years ago.’ These underlying emotions, if the multi-faith mediation team could address somewhere, and get people to understand that irrespective of faith, irrespective of the past... this country needs to move on ahead.It is argued that for Hindus it is a matter of faith as far as the spot is concerned, whereas the right of worship of Muslims can be exercised anywhere. The idea behind the mediation seems to be to get the Muslim side to give up their claim over the site, and instead have a mosque elsewhere. Against this backdrop, it is interesting that the Sunni Wakf Board and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board were open to the idea of mediation, whereas the three Hindu parties were not in favour of it.S.H.:You are right that the Muslim side in a way perceives itself to be the weaker side, and it had always said whatever the court orders, it will abide by it. The thing on the Hindu side is that after all this is god’s property. There is almost a sense of crusade out there and we cannot give up anything, having started the fight in god’s name. At the end of the day, Hindus and Muslims are all part of India.S.M.:We should avoid any impression that the institutions of our governance process are skewing the whole balance in favour of favour of majoritarian coercive politics. Because, I think the people of the minority faith have a sense of grievance that they have not been given a fair deal in this process. In fact, even the ruling that the acquisition of land was legitimate because the place of worship is not an essential part of the religious faith of Muslims — that also has caused some disquiet... but now they’re even being restrained from even offering prayers in public places.Would you like to comment on the choice of the mediators?S.H.:Well, about two choices nobody has any doubts: Sriram Panchu and Justice Kalifulla. The question is about Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. The point is that you needed somebody on the Hindu side who could possibly sell a settlement to the larger Hindu community. Therefore it did make sense to bring in a holy man. But why this particular godman? That is a choice left to individual judges who can constitute the Bench.S.M.:Well, he’s on record saying Muslims should give up their claim to the title of the land and also threatening dire consequences if that does not happen. So, that gives him not exactly the best claim to being a fair mediator to this process. So before the task of achieving a mediated outcome between the different litigants to this process, I think the mediators have to achieve consensus amongst themselves about how they’re going to approach this. And given the composition of this team, I think that is not a trivial challenge.What do you think will be the larger implications for constitutional values like the rule of law and secularism, when this litigation reaches either an adjudicated or negotiated settlement?S.H.:Quite frankly, I think we, as a democracy, gave up our belief in the rule of law on December 6, 1992. What we are trying to do is to snatch back whatever remains; to rebuild it, because ultimately, let me put it this way and this is my question to even those who propound a Hindu Rashtra: Even a Hindu Rashtra can’t work without the rule of law. And if you do something which is out of the law, and then you try to retrospectively make it right, it just doesn’t work.S.M.:That is the key question going forward. Because once you have destroyed the faith that people of different religious convictions might have in the neutrality of the governance process, it is very difficult to retrieve that. Over the last 30 years, the balance has shifted too far in favour of majoritarian assertion and we’ve allowed a number of political campaigns to ride on this issue, which should have been settled right at the moment it was born. That default over 30 years has allowed this issue to become a political matter on which very emotive campaigns were mounted by both sides. The damage has been very deep and it’ll be very lasting unless we sort things out very quickly."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On Women’s Day this year, messages clogged my inbox. They offered tempting discounts in salons, on shoes, clothes and cosmetics, and even complimentary cocktails. Despite women organising seminars on finance, sexual harassment and health problems across the country, tokenistic marketing threatened to reduce the day to hashtags and discounts.The irony and historyOn the International Women’s Day 2019 website, the partners included McDonald’s, Amazon and Oracle. McDonald’s is facing flak in the U.S. for failing to pay its largely female workforce the minimum wage, Amazon is reported to have a huge gender diversity problem, and Oracle is facing a civil rights suit that alleges female employees were paid on average $13,000 less per year than men doing similar work. All three were apparently in support of the 2019 campaign theme, ‘Better the balance, better the world’.The irony of all this is particularly rich given that International Women’s Day has its origins in socialism. German socialist and feminist Clara Zetkin, who organised the first International Women’s Day, was a socialist first and a feminist next. In the magazineDie Gleichheit(Equality), Zetkin wrote in 1894: “Bourgeois feminism and the movement of proletarian women are two fundamentally different social movements.” Zetkin held that “bourgeois feminists” were not concerned with the conditions of working class women who were fighting not only against men who sought to suppress them, but also with men against a common oppressor, capitalism. She believed that as white, upper class feminists would only fight to better their own conditions, socialism was the only way to serve the needs of working class women.Zetkin suggested in the Second International Conference of Socialist Women at Copenhagen in 1910 that Women’s Day be celebrated each year, the foremost purpose of which would be “to aid the attainment of women’s suffrage”. The timing for the proposal was ideal — a year earlier, the Socialist Party in the U.S. had also suggested that a National Women’s Day be observed, in honour of a strike that took place in 1908. More than 15,000 women garment workers fought for higher wages and shorter working hours in that strike.Following Zetkin’s proposal, International Women’s Day was observed in a few European countries on March 19, commemorating the 1848 Revolution in Prussia when a people’s uprising had forced the king to promise women the right to vote, which he later failed to keep.But the day became truly revolutionary only later. In Russia, protests erupted on March 8, 1917, against World War I and brought down the Tsarist Empire. The new government gave the women the right to vote. International Women’s Day was thus a day of resistance and demand. The reason the UN observed the day only decades later, from 1975 onwards, was because the Americans were aware of — and wary of — its origins in socialism.Over the decades, women’s demands have varied across cultures. In India, for instance, following the anti-colonial and social reform movement, the Constitution guaranteed justice, dignity and equality for women. However, these values came in conflict with old patriarchal values, thus limiting women’s progress. The women’s movement became fragmented, only to see a resurgence in the 1970s after the Emergency when there was a rallying cry for civil rights. This led to the birth of several women’s organisations, which successfully pushed for legal reforms. The women’s movement slowly regained strength, fighting against dowry deaths, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. However, it never really appreciated the struggles of Dalit and Bahujan women.Issues in IndiaOn this March 8, in some parts of the world (mostly Latin America and Europe), women continued to do what women in the early ’90s did — protest. In India, however, several companies with gender diversity and pay gap problems celebrated the day, despite the alarming trend of more and more women withdrawing from the workforce (female participation in the workforce fell from 42.7% in 2004-05 to 23.3% in 2017-18). WhatsApp forwards continued to celebrate women as mothers, daughters and sisters who are able to multi-task effortlessly, underlining the widespread belief that it is acceptable for women to work as long as they also carry out their traditional duties at home. Given the huge inequality in the treatment and payment of women workers, and with labour conditions being unfriendly to women, it is important to ask what really women want on this day: roses or reforms?Instead of celebrating women, companies would do well to reflect on how they treat their women: is their pay on a par with men? Are sexual harassment cells in place and do they function? Are there crèches at workplaces? And what about the informal sector, the working class women, who are not represented by “bourgeois feminists”? How do we consolidate various women’s movements across classes and castes?In an increasingly unequal world, March 8 gives us the opportunity to ask ourselves how much more is to be done and how it is to be accomplished. Instead of allowing a day rooted in protest to be taken over by consumerism, women could mobilise around specific issues — better sanitation facilities and better wages — and make sustained demands for effective change in their conditions.[email protected]"
Outfits ‘inciting’ mass protests under watch,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/outfits-inciting-mass-protests-under-watch/article26539350.ece,,,"With widespread political and social outrage over the Pollachi sexual abuse case, the police and intelligence agencies claim to have “credible” information that sympathisers of the Left wing extremism were trying to incite college students to stage mass agitations.Intelligence personnel said activists were distributing pamphlets among college students in the city to seek their support for such protests.The police have increased security at sensitive places in Coimbatore district to prevent a large assembly of protesters, similar to the jallikattu protests in 2017.Two women activists of Students Uprising Movement for Social Awareness (SUMS) had distributed notices in a private college in the city, which said that “people’s protest alone would bring an end to sexual abuse of women, not the judiciary and the police”.The notices bore the names of organisations such as SUMS, Women Uprising Movement (WUM), Caste Annihilation Liberation Front (CALF) and Anti Imperialist Movement (AIM). These said that “the 270-odd victims of the gang could be the sisters, daughters or mothers of anyone among us and should this should not be treated as mere news”.The organisations called for open protests against the ruling AIADMK and BJP Governments, accusing them of protecting the offenders in the case.Intelligence personnel said several other organisations, whose presence was noticed during the violence in the jallikattu protests in 2017, were also inciting students and the youth to go on mass agitations, which would would lead to law and order issues. Posts and photos uploaded by these organisations in social media were also under the watch of the police and intelligence agencies.A senior police officer of Coimbatore City Police toldThe Hinduthat the VOC Grounds, the venue for the jallikattu protests, was under surveillance. The police would not permit protesters to gather at the ground, the official said."

Mr. Gandhi said that those who were responsible for the murders of Kripesh and Sarath Lal would be brought to justice. He alleged that the CPI(M) was only capable of unleashing violence, but they were silent on other issues. “Where was the CPI(M) when Kerala was facing the floods?

The rubber growers also had been affected, he said. “ The CPI(M) has a lot to answer to the people of Kerala,” Mr. Gandhi said. Drawing parallels between the methodologies of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh-Bharatiya Janata Party, Mr. Gandhi said that both were only capable of using violence against their political rivals.Mr. Gandhi said that if voted to power, his party would introduce a “minimum income line” to help the weaker sections and deposit a certain amount of money into the bank accounts of those whose income was below the minimum line.Focus on healthMr. Gandhi said that his party was also planning to focus more on health and education and bring down the per capita expenditure of families on these fronts.Reiterating his promise to pass the Women's Reservation Bill ensuring 33% of reservation to women in legislatures, the Congress leader also offered to pass a law that would guarantee similar representation of women in all “national institutions”."

Mr. Shaw, who is Climate Change Minister and whose party is part of the ruling centre-left coalition, was not seriously injured.His office said two members of the public helped him and he continued to Parliament, attending a meeting before going to hospital for a precautionary check-up. He suffered a black eye, telling stuff.co.nz “it looks worse than it is”.Police said a 47-year-old man was arrested and would appear in court on Friday.Political violence is practically unheard of in New Zealand, a nation of about 4.5 million where most government Ministers do not have a regular security detail.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that “in New Zealand, you just don’t expect these things to happen”. “We have an environment in New Zealand where politicians are accessible, and that’s something we should feel proud of,” she told reporters."

What was once described as a formidable ‘Caliphate’ of enormous wealth and with huge potential for expansion is now just a dot on the soil of Syria and Iraq.

Reports are that the nearest safe sanctuary for refugees, at al-Hol in northeast Syria, is now more than 60,000 strong, with women and children constituting the majority.The temptation, however, to dismiss the IS as one of those upstarts which make an appearance once in a while in modern history and offer no lessons for the future has to be resisted. This is because the pull internationally for the IS was undeniably greater than for al-Qaeda. It projected a tighter hierarchy and structure, though in a smaller geography, and drew thousands of volunteers from different nations. The impact of this assembly of men and women, at times across religions, was lethal beyond belief. This model of organising people solely to unleash terror after acquiring formidable human and material resources — oil and government treasuries in the IS’s case — could be expected to inspire all those playing the card of Islamic extremism.Shamima’s storyHowever powerful the message of violence and savagery that the IS sent during the past few years may be, there are facets of individual tragedy intertwined with the sordid movement that cannot be lost sight of. For example,the story of Shamima Begum, a British-born teenager who in 2015 fled with two friends to join the IS, stands out here for its uniqueness and excessive human misery.Begum, 19, was in the news recently. Of the other two, one died in a bombing of Raqqa city, while there is little information on the third. Of Bangladeshi parentage, Begum was stripped of her British citizenship last year because of her IS links. In the past few months she had expressed her desire to return to her home country, obviously after being disillusioned with the IS, and mainly to seek medical treatment for a child who was ailing but subsequently passed away. Begum, who is “married” to aDutch IS fighter, has said that she lost two other children. The Dutch fighter, 27, is now under detention in a neighbouring prisoner camp.No re-entryThe U.K. Home Secretary, who said Begum had been denied permission to re-enter the country, has been criticised for his alleged disregard of the human rights of a young British mother now in distress. The ruling against her being let back into the U.K. highlights the modern dilemma of how exactly to blend compassion with the need to combat terror relentlessly in parts of the globe. There is the charge that the U.K. Foreign Office did not act fast enough to rescue the child, who was entitled to U.K. citizenship. In its defence, the Foreign Office is said to have taken the stand that there were too many risks involved in sending a team to Syria for this purpose.Begum is one of several IS followers in Syria and Iraq who are anxious to return to their respective home countries, but cannot do so because of the hard stance of their governments against their repatriation. These governments, mostly in Europe and nations with a Muslim minority, such as Germany, France and Belgium, believe that there is no place for mercy for their citizens who left their homes consciously in order to join terror organisations. This uncompromising stand seems cruel against the backdrop of credible accounts of IS women volunteers being subjected to slavery and sexual abuse.In the final analysis, the IS saga provides a case study of how the draw of terrorist ideology can gain strength, expand and then evaporate at equally fast speed. We know that extremism of any kind — including Naxalism in India — is a magnet for some young minds. The heady cocktail of a spirit of adventure and frustrations early on in life is what spurs youngsters such as Begum, and no amount of censorship or counselling, either online or in forums such as places of worship, can wean them away. Equally true is a case of swift disenchantment.Shadow in the backgroundIt is too soon to conclude that the IS is past history. Governments are quite conscious of the gaps in their border control measures which have enabled some IS cadres to sneak back into their home countries. This is analogous to what happened soon after the decline of al-Qaeda following Osama bin Laden’s death. The infiltration, even if it is a trickle, could be extremely dangerous if one considers the insidious nature of the sleeper cells of many terror groups which remain undetected for several years but come to notice only after their involvement in deadly operations, examples being the 9/11 (New York City in 2001) and 26/11 (Mumbai in 2008) attacks. Significantly, the Iraqi President, Barham Salih, went on record a few days ago to say that although the ‘Caliphate’ has been eliminated, there are sleeper cells and extremist groups on the Syrian border which needed to be taken care of.The presence, however, of sleeper cells alone may not be sufficient for terror groups to gain ground.

‘Half the victims in rape cases are minors’,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/half-the-victims-in-rape-cases-are-minors/article26526305.ece,"
They mostly hail from Agency and rural areas of the district, say Sakhi Cell counsellors
",,"One Stop Centre (Sakhi Cell), which has been set up at King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam, to cater to the needs of victims of sexual abuse, domestic violence, cheating etc, has been receiving about 20 to 30 calls per month.The counsellors say that among the cases, rape and cheating cases top the chart. But what seems to be worrying is that, almost half of the victims in rape cases are said to be minors.“In February, we received 26 cases, in which almost 20 cases are of cheating and rape. In about 10 rape victims, five are minors.The recent minor, we counselled was the 15-year old Class IX girl, who was allegedly raped by a teacher at Cheedikada mandal in Visakhapatnam district,” said Administrator of One Stop Centre Padmavathi.‘Known persons’Ms Padmavathi also said that there were incidents, in which five-year-old and 10-year-old girls were also brought to the centre.Moreover victims in these cases, mostly hail from Agency or rural areas of Visakhapatnam district, she said.Referring to the past incidents, a senior police officer from the city said that in most of the cases, known persons (lover, family relatives, neighbours etc), auto-rickshaw drivers have been the accused, who befriend the victims and trap them.16 members“In many cases, the victim say that they were threatened not to tell about the rape, but they come to light after parents found some behavioural change in the girl,” he said. At present, the One Stop Centre works with 16 member staff with Women Police Station Assistant Commissioner of Police as Nodal Officer, at King George Hospital.The team in One Stop Centre counsels and tries to bring them back to normal life.Cheating cases“Some women undergo complete depression after such incidents. It's also sad to see women and teenage girls in such stage. We counsel them about importance of life and ask to lead normal life again. We advise them to focus on studies, career, achieve greater heights and do good to the society, giving case studies,” added Ms Padmavathi.The One Stop Centre is also witnessing a number of cheating cases referred by the women police station. The officials say that in most of these cases, teenage, college-going and even educated girls are falling in the trap of several men, who make false marriage promises. Dowry harassment cases also reach One Stop Centre, in which it was observed that many husbands in these cases are alcohol addicts."
A story about love,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-story-about-love/article26528116.ece,"
Ranjit Jeyakodi opens up aboutwhat motivated him to write Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum ,and the failure of Puriyatha Puthir
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With just a day left for release, director Ranjit Jeyakodi is relaxed aboutIspade Rajavum Idhaya Raaniyum(IRIR), his second directorial afterPuriyatha Puthir. “There’s nothing we can do now...it all depends on how the audience receives it,” he says, rather nonchalantly. AfterPuriyatha Puthirreleased and wasn’t received well at the box office, Ranjit was planning to make a crime-thriller, for which he had the story ready. However, he was apprehensive that he would be perceived as a ‘dark’ filmmaker. “I didn’t want to be boxed into one category. Which is why I wantedIspade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyumto be my second film,” he adds.Ranjit says he formulated the skeleton of the story even before he made his début. Does the filmmaker decide the genre before sitting at the writing table? He laughs it off, “You can’t write a film based on its genre. The story has to take shape, which itself is a tedious process.”Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyumis an odd-yet-intriguing title to begin with. Ranjith acknowledges this and says, “The purpose of the title is to attract the audience, right? I like using poetic titles. In fact, the title is inspired from one of Jayakanthan’s short stories.” He adds, “Spade and Queen are essential in the game of cards. Which is to say that ‘love’ itself is a gamble of sorts.” The director was irked by the romanticism of falling-in-love template, and had questions about the concept of love, which he says, prompted him to writeIRIR. “How can you hurt somebody you love? When you do, is it love at all? These are some of the questions that bothered me. Sometimes, people tend to use love as an excuse to hurt each other. In such case, how can we romanticise love in films, when the reality is far different?”When the trailer forIRIRwas out, there were obvious comparisons to Telugu blockbusterArjun Reddy. However, Ranjit considers himself fortunate that people are comparing his film to a ‘cult movie’. He adds, “You’ll feel inferior only when they compare it to a bad product. Otherwise, it’s good that people are talking about my film. Invariably, there’s a reference for every movie and that’s how we have been tuned. My film has nothing to do withArjun Reddy.”Ranjit describesIRIRas a violent love story. He elaborates, “Violent... in the sense of dominance. More than physical, it’s about the psychological violence that leads to certain unwarranted things. The character arc of the hero is violent by nature, while the heroine is kind-hearted. We wanted to show the dichotomy between the characters.” Toxic masculinity has been one of the recurring phenomenon in films such asArjun Reddy. How has Ranjit handled this factor? “I don’t consider these things while I’m writing. If I start thinking about the critics, I would be failing as a writer. So, they don’t bother me much.”There’s a certain stereotyping when it comes to depicting self-inflicting, sober heroes.

He is someone who doesn’t even know he has a beard. That was the idea.” From the trailer, the heroine comes across as a bold, independent woman who doesn’t shy away from expressing her sexual feelings. Recently,90MLinvited vehement criticisms for showing women in a poor light. Was Ranjit worried about90ML’s impact while etching out the female character? “Not at all.IRIRis more about love than the person. It’s a not a love story, but a story about love. So, there’s no question of gender here.”Even thoughIRIRis his second release, Ranjit believes he has become more mature after what he went through forPuriyatha Puthir, which landed in a financial soup and released after three years in 2017. “When things are beyond your control, you have no other option but to accept. When the film released, Tamil Nadu was in a state of mourning because of the suicide of Anitha over NEET. After a week, it was removed from theatres,” he says, adding, “Nevertheless, I will be working with Vijay Sethupathi again next year.”“You can’t write a film based on its genre.

"Meet Noel Bowler, a photographer who is travelling the world to capture empty spaces",https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/meet-noel-bowler-a-photographer-who-is-travelling-the-world-to-capture-empty-spaces/article26521026.ece,"
Long after the reporters and workers have left for the day, robust newsrooms and union offices have compelling tales to tell. Noel Bowler travels the world photographing the unvarnished truth about these spaces
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The conference room atThe Hinduheadquarters in Chennai echoes to the sound of Noel Bowler’s rich Irish brogue. The 41-year-old from England has spent nearly a decade hearing his voice echo in uninhabited rooms around the world. The lecturer in Photography at University Campus Suffolk trains his camera on an unusual subject — dormant spaces that until a few hours ago were alive with conversation and creativity.“Spaces with no people — that’s the kind of photography I’m interested in. I like the idea that when someone looks at the picture of an empty room, they imagine the people. Every person brings his own ideals and prejudices to it. If you have a person seated at the desk, I think they would examine it less critically. If all the information is there, there is nothing to challenge you,” says Bowler, who was in India recently as part of a four-year project capturing newsrooms across the world.This is Bowler’s second such venture. His earlier work, published as a bookUnionin 2015, is a portrait of union offices redolent with the air of animated conversation.Drawn from 14 countries, from the US and Poland to his native Ireland, it was an attempt to capture beleaguered centuries-old organisations founded at a time when the idea of work was different.Snapshot from the office of The Hindu, Chennai

For the current project,The Hinduis one of the few newspapers I could access in South Asia,” says Bowler, adding, “I started where I lived, in Dublin, withThe Irish Times. During the course of my research, I read an article inThe New York Timesabout the paper moving online and I thought it fascinating to capture print newsrooms before they disappear. When I moved to England, I photographed atThe Independent, The Sun, theFinancial TimesandThe Telegraph. In the US, it wasThe New York Times, The Washington Post, and thePittsburgh Post-Gazette.In Japan, I visitedThe Asahi ShimbunandThe Yomiuri Shimbunand in Paris,Le Monde. I look at large circulated papers representative of an ethos. And since I can’t afford to fly everywhere, it is also dictated by budget.”With a rare interest that straddles the worlds of photography and travel, Bowler feels that projects have to crystallise despite a time frame.“A project is finished when it is finished. I have a general idea of a newsroom, but I’m not a journalist; neither have I worked with a newspaper. I have to learn from everyone I meet and allow the project to change slightly. I have a set pattern of how I approach it, the logistics of how I organise it and how I get to it. I keep an open mind on the narrative.”Each of his pictures begs to tell a story. Bowler’s newsrooms capture reporters’ desks crowded with leaning stacks of books and sheaves of paper, the odd one filled with curios from around the world and family photographs, and corridors with potted plants that lead to rooms where stories of shifting geopolitics are written.Mirroring societyThere is both hubris and history in the union rooms filled with plaques and worn-out jackets; the stillness of the space lends it a sensory air and a voice despite the absence of people.Bowler’s portraits are a microcosm of the world inhabited by people, through their articles of faith, half-written notes, empty water bottles and stationery. “I don’t clean up. The idea of photography is truth. I’m interested in the evidence of people than the people themselves.”It is an interest that Bowler has pursued since he first fell in love with photography as a pre-teen. “I had a Yashica and I took pictures of clichéd images like sunsets. I found it therapeutic. I loved the process.”Noel Bowler

For the projects, I use a Mamiya RB67, a fully manual camera. I use medium format film; it’s a slow process with 10 frames per roll. I have to wait till I process the film in England to see the results.”Does he capture life beyond newsrooms as he travels the world? “I do, but I use my phone for social media. Every city reminds you of somewhere else. Chennai is much like Bangkok but crazier, as far as traffic goes,” says Bowler. “I love photographing architecture in general, interiors in particular. I like the ordinary and the everyday, more than the spectacular. I love the idea that the dirt on the walls lends it character.”Bowler, whose work has been exhibited worldwide, including at The New York Photo Festival and Les Rencontres d’Arles, says his place of passion is Italy. “The narrow streets, the buildings, it’s a very Instagramable country.”At the University, he teaches Critical Theory and Ambition. “It’s a difficult thing to teach; I try and inspire students to drive themselves. It’s hard because it isn’t in a book, so you set an example. I’d like to come back to India. Working in Afghanistan was a challenge. I didn’t photograph the war but women’s football. It was more interesting than the bombs. That’s where we should be looking. We have to show the violence, but also that life goes on.”"

K. Sudhakaran to lock horns with P.K. Sreemathy again in the constituency, a repeat of the 2014 LS poll
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Kannur Lok Sabha constituency is set for a repeat of the no-holds-barred electioneering as witnessed in 2014, with Congress leader K. Sudhakaran locking horns with Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s P.K. Sreemathy again.Ms. Sreemathy had then wrested the seat from him with a margin of 6,000-odd votes.Mr. Sudhakaran’s candidature was greeted by Congress and United Democratic Front (UDF) workers who turned up in large numbers at the Kannur railway station to receive him on his arrival from Kochi in the morning.The reception at the station was an informal flagging off of what is expected to be a fierce battle of Mr. Sudhakaran, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee vice president, to wrest the seat back from Ms. Sreemathy. Mr. Sudhakaran won the seat in the 2009 election by a margin of 43,151 votes defeating his CPI(M) rival K.K. Ragesh.“The Congress is on a comeback trail in the country and all Lok Sabha constituencies, including Kannur, will reflect this change,” Mr. Sudhakaran told the media at the railway station. He said the coming election was a fight against two “fascist forces”, fascism of political violence in the State and fascism at the national level.He also said the UDF workers were facing the election carrying in their hearts sentiments of UDF activists whose blood was shed in Kannur and Kasaragod. The Congress and the UDF were confident that the seat would be captured, he said.The party leadership also exuded confidence that Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s visit on Thursday of the families of party workers hacked to death in Kannur and Kasaragod would galvanise party workers for the electoral battle.Rahul in Kannur todayMr. Gandhi would reach the Kannur airport by 12 noon. He would meet at the airport VIP lounge members of the family of Youth Congress worker S.P. Shuhaib, who was hacked to death allegedly by CPI(M) workers on February 12, 2018, and other party workers who were victims of political attacks.Spending 40 minutes with them, he would fly in a helicopter to Periye in Kasaragod to visit the families of Youth Congress workers Kripesh and Sarath Lal, who were hacked to death by suspected CPI(M) workers on February 17."

At least 17 other people, mostly children, were also shot at the Raul Brasil elementary school in Sao Paulo; gunmen kill themselves
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Two armed men wearing face masks entered a Brazilian elementary school on Wednesday and shot and killed at least six children who were on their snack breaks, as well as two school officials, before fatally turning their guns on themselves, police said.Ten people, including the gunmen, were killed in total, Sao Paulo police said.The unidentified gunmen, who appeared to be between 20 and 25 years of age, shot and killed a worker at a nearby car wash before their attack at the Raul Brasil school, police said. More than 1,000 children aged between 11 and 15 attend classes there.Another 17 people - mostly school kids - were shot and injured, and several of them were in serious condition, said police, who were not yet aware of a motive for the violence.Marcelo Salles, commander of police forces in Sao Paulo State, spoke just outside the school and said that in his over three decades of service, he had “never seen anything like this, it was an unspeakably brutal crime"".Mr. Salles said the gunmen used at least one .38 caliber pistol, along with homemade bombs and a crossbow. Police arrived eight minutes after the shooting started and did not confront the gunmen, who had already killed themselves, he said.A homemade video taken during the shooting and aired by Globo TV showed children screaming, running and begging for their lives as loud shots were heard all around.Security cameras from homes near the school showed children climbing and jumping over a white wall that surrounds the Raul Brasil building, and sprinting down streets, screaming for help.Police said the two men, who they did not believe were former students at the school, entered the building and started shooting at about 9:30 a.m. local time.Another shooting took place about 500 meters from the Raul Brasil school shortly before the killings at the school, but it was not yet clear if the two incidents were related.Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said as he stood outside the school that “our solidarity goes out to the families of the victims.”“I was shocked with the scenes I saw inside that school,” Mr. Doria said. “It is the saddest thing I have seen in my life.”School shootings are rare in Brazil, even though the country is one of the world's most violent, with more annual homicides than any other. The last major school shooting was in 2011, when 12 children were shot dead by a former pupil in Rio de Janeiro.While gun laws are extremely strict in Brazil, it is not difficult to illegally purchase a weapon."

Sheikh Darvesh Saheb not relieved from CB
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The newly posted Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) for north Kerala, Sheikh Darvesh Saheb, is yet to take up his assignment as he has not been relieved from the Crime Branch.Last week, the Cabinet decided to appoint Mr. Saheb, an officer of the 1990 IPS batch, as the post was lying vacant for a year. The posting by the State government came ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in Kerala slated for April 23.Administrative processSome administrative procedures, Home Department sources said, was delaying the relieving order. Besides, no officer has also been posted to head the Crime Branch. Another senior officer, T.K. Vinod Kumar who has been posted as ADGP (Intelligence) has been asked to take up the additional charge of the Crime Branch Department.Mr. Saheb was to join duty this Monday as he had received the orders last Wednesday.With the model code of conduct coming into effect after the Election Commission of India announced the dates of polls, new postings are unlikely to be cancelled. Further, all posting and the actions of IPS officers are being monitored.The government, it is learnt, was forced to make the appointment with the looming general elections. Incidentally, the posting came when the Home Department was planning to abolish the post of ADGP, and instead revert the post to the rank of Inspector General of Police (IGP).This would also have created more problems as two ranges — Kannur and Thrissur — which functioned under the North Zone should have officers of the rank of IGP.Daunting taskSources said that the new ADGP has a daunting task at hand with frequent reports of political violence from north Kerala.This would be more precarious before and after the Lok Sabha elections as the districts in Kannur range are either communally or politically volatile.The murder of two Youth Congress workers – Kripesh and Sarath Lal – at Periya in Kasaragod has ignited a political unrest in that district. Both Kannur and Kozhikode rural districts are politically sensitive. Another challenge is the Left-wing extremism in Wayanad district."

Ranjit Jeyakodi on what motivated him to write Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum, which releases tomorrow, and the failure of Puriyatha Puthir ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With just a day left for release, director Ranjit Jeyakodi is relaxed aboutIspade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum(IRIR), his second directorial afterPuriyatha Puthir. “There’s nothing we can do now... it all depends on how the audience receives it,” he says, rather nonchalantly. AfterPuriyatha Puthirreleased and wasn’t received well at the box office, Ranjit was planning to make a crime-thriller, for which he had the story ready. However, he was apprehensive that he would be perceived as a ‘dark’ filmmaker. “I didn’t want to be boxed into one category. Which is why I wantedIspade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyumto be my second film,” he adds.Ranjit says he formulated the skeleton of the story even before he made his début. Does the filmmaker decide the genre before sitting at the writing table? He laughs it off, “You can’t write a film based on its genre. The story has to take shape, which itself is a tedious process.”Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyumis an odd-yet-intriguing title to begin with. Ranjit acknowledges this and says, “The purpose of the title is to attract the audience, right? I like using poetic titles. In fact, the title is inspired from one of Jayakanthan’s short stories.” He adds, “The Spade and Queen are essential in the game of cards. Which is to say that ‘love’ itself is a gamble of sorts.” The director was irked by the romanticism of the falling-in-love template, and had questions about the concept of love, which he says, prompted him to writeIRIR. “Sometimes, people tend to use love as an excuse to hurt each other. How can you hurt somebody you love? When you do, is it love at all? These are some of the questions that bothered me. How can we romanticise love in films, when the reality is far different?”When the trailer forIRIRwas out, there were obvious comparisons to Telugu blockbusterArjun Reddy. However, Ranjit considers himself fortunate that people are comparing his film to a ‘cult movie’. He adds, “You’ll feel inferior only when they compare it with a bad product. Otherwise, it’s good that people are talking about my film. Invariably, there’s a reference for every movie and that’s how we have been tuned. My film has nothing to do withArjun Reddy.”Ranjit describesIRIRas a violent love story. He elaborates, “Violent... in the sense of dominance. More than physical, it’s about the psychological violence that leads to certain unwarranted situations. The hero is violent by nature, while the heroine is kind-hearted. We wanted to show the dichotomy between the characters.” Toxic masculinity has been a recurring phenomenon in films such asArjun Reddy. How has Ranjit handled this factor? “I don’t consider these things while I’m writing. If I start thinking about the critics, I would be failing as a writer. So, they don’t bother me much.”There’s a certain stereotyping when it comes to depicting self-inflicting, sober heroes. Invariably, he sports a bearded look and wears dull shirts. “Beard doesn’t signify ruggedness. The character (Harish Kalyan) doesn’t care about himself and is detached from the world. He is someone who doesn’t even know he has a beard. That was the idea.” From the trailer, the heroine comes across as a bold, independent woman who doesn’t shy away from expressing her sexual feelings. Recently,90MLinvited criticisms for showing women in a poor light.

However, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had welcomed the move.A senior officer attached to the CEO’s office said the Election Commission of India’s thinking was that exposure to hate speech could increase prejudice in society and make it difficult for the electorate to dial down their emotions and reason before they vote.Poll panel’s concernsMoreover, when amplified by social media, incendiary rhetoric and messaging could incite political and communal violence.

Attack followed argument in the group
",,"The Nehru Nagar police have booked two brothers, aged 16 and 17, for allegedly stabbing two of their friends in the heat of an argument on Monday night, seriously injuring them.According to the police, the incident occurred around 10.45 p.m at Shivaji Maidan in Kurla. “All four boys are friends and live in Qureshi Nagar. They frequently meet at the ground. On Monday, an argument erupted between the four over an old dispute,” senior police inspector Vilas Shinde, Nehru Nagar police station, said.The commotion attracted the attention of residents, who restrained the two accused and took the victims, Arif and Samad Khan, to Sion Hospital, where both have been admitted.The police were informed about the incident, and a team was sent to conduct inquiries. In keeping with the procedure for juveniles, the two boys were called to the police station on Tuesday morning for inquires. “After conducting inquiries, we have registered a case of attempt to murder against them and produced them in a juvenile justice court, which sent them to the juvenile remand home in Dongri,” Mr. Shinde said.Meanwhile, reports of the assault having stemmed from Player Unknown’s Battle Ground (PUBG), a popular online game where participants attack and eliminate each other in the virtual world, started doing the rounds early on Tuesday. The addictive game has been in the news for several months, with some educational institutes in the country banning it on campus.‘No connection to PUBG’Mr. Shinde, however, refuted the reports. “Inquiries so far, including statements of the accused and eyewitnesses, do not indicate any connection to the game. We have found that the two victims were stabbed with a switchblade that the 17-year-old accused was carrying with him. We are probing further to find out where and why he got the weapon,” Mr. Shinde said.Psychiatrist Dr. Harish Shetty said violence among youngsters has become very common. “The age of violence has gone down. We see more and more young children involved in such crimes,” Dr. Shetty said. He said exposure to violence through reading, movies and other media often acts as a stimulant for those with latent violent traits. “Also, there is no faith in the system of redressal and there is a belief that a violent person seldom gets punished.”"

India is a resilient democracy, proud of its brave armed forces.

The principles that inform a lived life of dignity must dictate choices in the great Indian election of 2019 ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The schedule for the 2019 general election has been announced, and the political arena has once again been transformed into a gigantic market place. In this space political parties proceed to outbid and undercut each other, often in shocking ways, as they desperately buy a commodity called state power. Every political party pursues state power as frantically as the Knights of King Arthur searched for the Holy Grail in medieval England. This is their project and their rationale for existence. Power saturates every site of social interaction, from the household to the workplace, but state power is unique because it is a condensate of all power. The state decides whether our lives are led in good, bad or ugly ways. The holders of state power resolve what sort of opportunities are offered by society and the economy, and whether we can participate in multiple social transactions as equals.All that’s at stakeUnderstandably, politicians yearn to take over the state. Some of them might even agree to sell their souls, drive a Faustian bargain so that they can acquire, possess and relish power. We are a democracy, but citizens are unable to control the possession, exercise and implementation of power by their representatives.A disturbing question haunts the corridors of our democracy. Are representatives responsive to their constituencies, to their wants, needs and aspirations? Or do they tend to subordinate the well-being of citizens to their own lust for office? The latter is painfully evident.Democratically elected governments can and have divided society, kept people in penury, imprisoned and tortured civil liberty activists, destroyed civil societies, and threatened war against neighbours. Overt and covert violence stalks our heels. Violence may have become the new normal in India, but there is little that is noble about violence. “Each new morn” says Macduff of war in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, “new widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven in the face, that it resounds.”Today, new sorrows follow us around like Mary’s little lamb because the government refuses to respect our need for a decent life, lived with dignity and in peace. Consider the way the Indian government has responded to serious economic distress in the country. Refusing to address the grim crisis in the agrarian sector which has destroyed livelihoods and driven farmers to suicide, the government decides to offer petty pocket money to the agriculturalist. Instead of transforming educational institutions, or taking on the onerous task of creating jobs with some determination, the Modi government offers pitiful reservations to graduates and postgraduates who have been forced to compete for positions below their capabilities. Worse, our government refuses to count how many Indian citizens are unemployed. It just does not acknowledge that poverty created through job losses does not only breed distress, it produces and reproduces discontent and anger, resentment and violence. Our representatives have failed us.For when we vote, we expect that our representative government will provide the basic preconditions of a good life. We do not expect it to tap petty passions and irrational emotions through incendiary rhetoric that targets communities, regions and other countries in the name of the nation. Cynics might wonder whether elections bring about change at all, or whether the outcome results in more of the same.Freedom from fearNevertheless, elections are significant. The opportunity to vote offers us choices, we can vote for the same violence that has left us with bloodied hands and torn feet. Or we can vote for a party that offers us freedom. At stake in the 2019 election are four kinds of freedoms. The first is freedom from fear, from the haunting feeling that someone, somewhere is watching how we behave, and that someone is ready to penalise us through words and deeds if we dare question the mockery that democracy gives power to the religious majority. Our own people who belong to the minority community need to be reassured that they are citizens of this country by right, and no one has the right to make them feel that they are here on sufferance. All of us have to be free from the nagging worry that our neighbourhoods will be overrun by lumpens on their monstrous motorcycles baying for blood at the drop of a hat, that citizens of India will be lynched and left to die painfully on the mud tracks of our cities and villages. Above all, we have the right to vent criticism of representatives without being assaulted by crude, sexist abuse on social media that relentlessly intrudes into our everyday lives.The second sort of freedom we should reinstall is freedom from want. Our farmers live in precarious conditions, our working class ekes out a bare existence steeped in misery and deprivation, our children are offered insecure and low paid jobs, and our minorities live under the constant threat that their livelihoods will be snatched from them. Seventy-one years after Independence, the government should be concerned about the quality of employment it offers our people, about suitable remuneration, about lives lived with dignity, and about the self-worth that people develop when they love what they do for a living.It is not enough that the working classes are handed out a mere pittance instead of a living wage. It is not sufficient that our people work for a mess of porridge, or that they should merely have enough to eat. It is the task of a democratic government to provide for basic preconditions — health, education, employment and a sustainable wage — that enable people to stand up and speak back to a history not of their making. This is what democracy means, not a handout here and a handout there. For this, we need to ask why should people remain poor.The third freedom that we have to re-capture is freedom from discrimination. Ironically, upper castes have mobilised against protections provided to one of the most vulnerable groups in human history, Dalits. It is paradoxical that reservations, which are meant to secure respect for those who are doubly disadvantaged by reasons of caste and class, are offered to the upper castes, which are already over-represented in the public sphere. Reservations have become a mockery, a charade, used as a deliberate ploy to delegitimise the project of social justice.The fourth freedom is freedom from sexual violence, for women, for men, for transgenders, and for children. India must never witness with horror and pain another child mauled, raped and mutilated as in Kathua. We must never bear witness to the ignoble spectacle of lawyers demonstrating in favour of rapists. We must never again register the horrific phenomenon of women being beaten up merely because they wish to visit their god in a temple. If India cannot secure equality, which is the reason for democracy, let us at least opt for non-discrimination, a lesser form of equality.A constitutional rightAt stake in the elections that loom large on our collective imaginations is not delegation of power to representatives, so that they can live out their sick fantasies of controlling minds and bodies. We vote to recapture and protect the freedom that earlier generations fought for so strenuously. We vote because freedom is our constitutional right and we will reclaim it.Neera Chandhoke is a former Professor of Political Science at Delhi University"

One device caught fire when opened but caused no injuries and services continued at all three hubs.The group, which calls itself the IRA, is made up of militants opposed to Northern Ireland's 1998 peace deal.It is separate and far smaller than the Provisional IRA, which was responsible for almost half of the 3,600 deaths during 30 years of violence and which disbanded after the peace deal.Dissident groups are smaller in number and capability though they have claimed lives in recent years including of two prison officers."

Death visited almost daily during times of war most horrifically, a 2015 suicide bombing that ripped through two shopping malls, killing over 300 people.But over the past year or so, the residents of Karrada have felt more normal than they have in decades. Streets lined with food stalls are crowded with shoppers, coffee shops and restaurants are packed until late, and the grey cement blast walls that protected against bombings are being removed.“I used to go to school and come back home, nothing more,” said Rusul Mohsen, a 33-year-old middle school teacher, seated recently at a store front sipping coffee. “If I went to a restaurant, I would ask to sit in a corner the farthest away from any windows, fearing a car bomb explosion might shatter the glass.”For the first time in 15 years there is no major war or insurgency in Iraq, and the defeat of the Islamic State group in late 2017 after a ruinous four-year war has given the population a moment of respite. Despite the enormous challenges ahead, there is a guarded sense of hope across the capital.Car bomb explosions that became the norm after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, making the Iraqi capital’s name synonymous with war, have ceased at least for now. Thousands of concrete barriers that snaked through the city as protection from suicide car bombers have been towed away in trucks, easing traffic.Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool said thousands of barriers have been towed away to a plot of land on the outskirts of the city, saying they may be used in the future around Baghdad to protect against infiltration.Parts of the heavily fortified Green Zone on the west bank of the Tigris River have reopened to the public, including public access to the landmark “Victory Arch” a 40-meter (131-feet) tall arch of two swords held by bronze casts of former dictator Saddam Hussein’s hands to commemorate the Iran-Iraq war.The U.S. established the Green Zone in 2003 to secure its embassy and Iraqi government institutions. But the zone became a symbol of the country’s inequality, fueling the perception among Iraqis that their government is out of touch.On the other side of the river, Baghdad’s famous Rasheed Street, the capital’s oldest street and cultural center known for its crumbling, old Iraqi houses, has also reopened for cars and pedestrians after a 15-year closure due to security risks.A new Central Bank headquarters, a towering waterfront building on the banks of the Tigris designed by the late Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid, is currently under construction, expected to be completed next year.“Baghdad feels better than it has since 2003,” remarked a veteran Western diplomat in Baghdad.Even so, the country faces massive challenges.The Islamic State group, which is about to lose its last shred of territory in neighboring Syria, is creeping back in Iraq, stepping up insurgent-style attacks in areas outside Baghdad and the country’s north. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced and much of the country is in ruins. The country is plagued by corruption, and in the oil-rich but parched south, violent riots have repeatedly broken out against living conditions.Baghdad, an ancient metropolis of 8 million people that was once the Arab world’s cultural center, is barely functional, its infrastructure crumbling. Armed militias who fought IS alongside the Iraqi armed forces roam the streets in what many see as the country’s latest menace, amid reports of kidnappings for ransom and general lawlessness. Unemployment, poverty and disenfranchised youth are widespread.“There is a big gap between people’s aspirations and the government ability to deliver,” the Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity so he could speak freely.Still, many hope that after years of bloodshed, Iraq is starting to turn a corner.In Karrada, the Hadi Center where a 2015 suicide bombing trapped people in a burning inferno for hours, killing around 300 people, is full of shoppers and youngsters fill the food court. The adjacent Laith Center had to be razed and rebuilt from scratch. It’s now almost completed.Assem Gharib, owner of a pastries and ice cream shop, said for years he used to pay someone to supervise the street outside his shop and keep cars from parking in front.“I used to be frightened whenever a car approached, imagining it to be a suicide bomber or a car bomb. Now it’s the opposite, we are happy when a car parks in front of the shop,” he said.That kind of confidence eluded most Iraqis for the past 15 years. The country has been at war, one way or another, for more than a generation, starting with the eight-year Iraq-Iran war that ended in 1988, followed by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent military intervention by the United States.The worst bloodletting came with the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which triggered an al-Qaida driven insurgency and sectarian violence that washed over the country, killing tens of thousands of Iraqis. Bombings reached up to 10 a day.The violence culminated with the Islamic State group, an al-Qaida offshoot, seizing Iraqi cities and declaring a self-styled Islamic caliphate over large parts of Iraq and Syria. That triggered a displacement crisis unprecedented in Iraq’s history. Millions fled their homes in the face of the militants’ rapid advance. Others fled as Iraqi forces, backed by the U.S. and Iran, battled back, ultimately reclaiming the last town in late 2017.Few dare to hope the current lull in fighting will last and many worry fear the growing power of the Shiite militias, known collectively as the Popular Mobilization Forces.Bashar Ali, a 33-year-old shop owner on Karrada street, said he fears the return of IS fighters from Syria and the lawlessness outside the city, including kidnappings and killings.“Baghdad is like my home, I feel safe in my own home, but when I go outside I don’t feel this way,” he said."

It must not be evicted from the public sphere on issues of national security
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In the wake of thePulwama terror attacklast month, politicians and opinion makers made impassioned pleas that ‘terror attacks should not be politicised’. There was also a strong popular sentiment for disassociating politics with what happened post-Pulwama. Unsurprisingly, the demand for dialling down politics was proportional to the demands for increased militarisation. The trust in politicians was replaced with an abiding belief that the men in uniform would save the day for India. When questions were raised about the basis of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s statement that over 250 terrorists were killed in theattack on Balakot— an increasingly suspect claim —it was argued that such questioning would weaken the morale of the armed forces and help the Pakistani narrative. For a proudly and deeply democratic country such as India, this scorn for politics is both perplexing and worrying.Politicising terrorism?The calls for refraining from politicising acts of terror also apply to most matters of national security. The strong belief, often convincingly articulated by leading thought leaders, that national security must be divorced from politics is so entrenched in popular narratives that any attempt at discussing national security through the lens of politics is immediately discredited: “How can someone politicise something as important as national security?”What is puzzling about such assertions is that most serious analysts and thoughtful politicians intuitively recognise that, at the end of the day, political solutions are the best answer to conflicts. And yet de-politicisation comes handy for the government since “do not politicise” also means “do not ask difficult questions”, a convenient way out of a tricky situation. For the general public, this results in weariness over how the political class has managed national security problems. In that sense, then, the aversion towards politics, especially in times of crisis, is essentially a function of the failure of the way in which politics and political debates are practised, not a negation of politics per se. The solution is to offer better political reasoning, and not replace political formulations with military ones, which is often seen as the easy way out.Popular narratives about solutions to our contemporary security problems demand the adoption of militaristic or securitised solutions as if the military has some superior capability for conflict resolution that politics doesn’t. The problem with privileging military solutions over political ones while dealing with conflict resolution is that the former use a specific set of tools, discourses and methods to resolve conflicts unlike the toolkit politics uses for conflict resolution. Consider an example. Post-Pulwama, the Government of India began a security crackdown in the Kashmir Valley and airlifted around 100 companies of paramilitary forces to enforce it, a typical and time-tested military solution to the unrest in the State of Jammu and Kashmir. A political solution would have been what the then United Progressive Alliance government adopted to deal with the widespread anger in the Valley in late 2010, wherein it sent a team of interlocutors to talk to the protesting Kashmiris. The interlocutors were able to bring about a sense of normalcy almost immediately, whereas the influx of more armed men into the Valley is unlikely to achieve that.Militarised methods and narratives also lead to de-politicisation, or the dismissal of normal politics from the public sphere, ushering in what could be called ‘temporary emergencies’. Here’s an example. In the immediate aftermath of the Pulwama attack, a leading Indian actress tweeted: “Anyone who lectures about non-violence and peace at this time should be painted black, put on a donkey and slapped by everyone on the streets.” Put differently, she advocated that the practice of normal politics (criticism of the establishment lies at the heart of normal politics) be suspended and be replaced by a depoliticised and securitised discourse. And that those who violate such ‘emergency’ should be punished. When such short spells of emergency are normalised, it opens the door for more permanent securitised spaces and narratives. Kashmir, more or less reeling under spells of temporary emergencies for close to three decades now, is a perfect example.Privileging militarisation over politicisation for conflict resolution is indeed unwise and counter-productive, an insight enshrined in the Clausewitzian dictum that war is the “continuation of politics by other means”. When divorced from their underlying political intent, militarised approaches can lead to mindless violence — something democratic societies should unconditionally resist. Military means to deal with conflicts do have their limited utility, but they must be politically guided.‘Freedom to the military’Another reflection of depoliticising security matters is the tendency to argue that the armed forces should be given complete autonomy to deal with security problems. In the immediate aftermath of Pulwama, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for instance, declared that the “armed forces have been given complete freedom to take action”, a statement that was well received by the general public. However, giving complete freedom to the military is replete with several complications, not the least of which is the indirect acknowledgement that the political class has failed to resolve the problem. For one, telling the armed forces that they are free to deal with the problem as they wish is a dangerous abdication of political responsibility which was entrusted to them through a democratic process.Second, ‘giving complete freedom to the military’ is an open invitation to use military solutions to deal with what are essentially political problems. Third, and even more important, ‘complete freedom’ flies in the face of political control that should be the hallmark of a mature democracy. It is one thing for the general public to nurture romantic notions about military solutions, but it is dangerous for the political class to actually enshrine that in policy guidance. Popular fetishes about military force are the stuff for feel-good fiction, not policy making.One direct implication of de-politicised conflict resolution is that it typically leads to more violence. Surprisingly, however, more violence doesn’t normally lead to an introspection about the utility of militaristic tools of conflict resolution — on the contrary, it further strengthens the belief in its uses. When men in uniform die, their loss becomes a rallying cry for more violence which then leads to even more casualties — the cycle goes on until political solutions are brought in. Take any militarised conflict, and you will see this point. The fact is that every death due to violence must be avoidable, and that can only happen if statesmen and women are willing to climb down from the cycle of violence. But for that to happen, there must be a decidedly political approach to conflict resolution.Root cause theoriesThere is also an entrenched popular aversion to using ‘root cause theories’ to explain conflicts around us. Not only are those attempting to explain conflicts by examining its root cases routinely shunned by impatient commentators, they are routinely viewed as apologists of non-state violence. While this antipathy towards root cause theorists is a function of depoliticised conflict narratives, it leads to further depoliticisation of conflicts. Depoliticised narratives aim to treat the symptoms, ignoring what gives rise to those symptoms — the latter is difficult, requires introspection and mending ways, while the former expects that military force can be used to end violence or resolve the problem at hand. Militarily framed responses to conflicts also deny justice since they can only be used to reinstate the state’s ‘monopoly over power’, not to provide justice to the aggrieved parties in a conflict.Let’s not forget that conflicts are a function of differing political values and expectations, and the only way sustainable conflict resolution can be achieved is by bringing politics back to negotiate those differences.Happymon Jacob teaches at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, and is the author of ‘Line on Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics’"

Among the issues they raised was the EC’s decision not to hold bypolls to three of the 21 vacant Assembly constituencies on account of pending election petitions. They demanded that bypolls be held in all the 21 seats on April 18.The CEO reportedly told them that it would be possible if the petitions were withdrawn.R.S. Bharathi, of the DMK, told reporters, “We asked him to conduct bypolls to the three constituencies as well. The CEO said that if the case was withdrawn from the court, there was a possibility of obtaining permission from the EC and holding elections.”The issue was also raised by S. Ezhumalai of the CPI(M). The party also asked the CEO to look into the issue of duplications in the electoral rolls.Mr. Bharathi said the party had asked the CEO to direct the Madurai Collector to convene an all-party meet on holding the polls on April 18, as the date coincided with the Chithirai festival.“We also asked the CEO to make arrangements for those attending the religious festival to be able to vote,” he said. The party had also asked the EC to ensure that criminals were kept under watch to prevent violence during or in the run-up to the election.AIADMK MLA and Deputy Speaker of the Assembly Pollachi Jayaraman said the party had assured the CEO that it would follow all the instructions issued by the EC. “But we have asked the EC to let water schemes continue to ensure regular water supply during summer,” he added."

Party’s screening committee to meet in New Delhi
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Congress screening committee for Kerala will hold its first meeting in New Delhi on Monday to begin the process of selecting candidates for the 16 seats that the party will contest under the United Democratic Front. However, the process will get some direction only after the party high command brings an element of clarity on fielding former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal and Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran.Several senior leaders, including V.D. Satheeshan and UDF convener Benny Behanan, too will get to express their views before the screening committee that comprises senior party leaders. The party high command had announced that all sitting candidates will be renominated. However, Mr. Ramachandran had expressed his wish to pull out and on Sunday, Mr. Venugopal also announced his disinclination to seek re-election from Alappuzha.KC(M) decisionMr. Chandy’s name has been doing the rounds, but a final call, especially on the choice of constituency, can be taken only after the Kerala Congress (M) sorts its internal differences out.Party leaders are unanimous in their view that Mr. Chandy’s presence in the fray will change the electoral dynamic of several constituencies in Central Travancore and a few outside this belt. With the Communist Party of India(Marxist) setting out to test the electoral arena with a “caste and religious formula” and the BJP zeroing in on a few constituencies hoping to capitalise on the polarisation caused by Sabarimala, Mr. Chandy is likely to face pressure from the High Command.Interestingly, it appears that both the UDF and the LDF have a shortage of candidates, prompting them to field sitting legislators and encash on their local appeal on the parliamentary canvass.MLAs in frayThe CPI(M) has fielded A.A. Arif, Aroor MLA, in Alappuzha and Veena George in Pathanamthitta, A. Pradeep Kumar in Kozhikode and P.V. Anwar in Ponnani, while the CPI has fielded legislators C. Divakaran and Chittayam Gopakumar.Adoor Prakash, Congress MLA from Konni, is being actively considered for Attingal or Alappuzha. The UDF will end up fielding two legislators if Mr. Chandy is also in the fray.The scrutiny committee would not overlook the fact that the CPI(M), led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, has not been doctrinaire in its candidate selection. The decision to field P. Jayarajan in Vadakara has also forced the Congress leadership to rethink its strategy. If Mr. Ramachadran sticks to his stand, it would prompt the Congress to support RMP leader K.K. Rema to focus on the cult of political violence promoted by the CPI(M).With Kerala going to the polls in the third phase, the Congress leadership has ample time to work on its election strategies and announce candidates. Congress president Rahul Gandhi will be in the State on March 14. According to Congress sources, the final list will be approved most probably by March 16."

Here is a fresh list of books for you to dig into this week, along with our reviews. Happy Reading! ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"FICTION‘I Have Become the Tide’: The years of the flood‘Where is that land where water flows free?’ This is the refrain of a song that Chikka’s cattle-skinner father sings, longing for renewal in a swift river. His daily reality, however, is the pond in the untouchable colony: frothy, filthy, boiling with algae, and cooking poison. Githa Hariharan’s novel begins a few centuries ago, on the day Chikka’s father is buried. Chikka flees the colony, carrying nothing but his drum and his despair, and finds refuge with two men who are part of a utopian society.'I Have Become the Tide' is a luminous novel that draws you out from its constructed world and throws you down in front of today’s newspaper, writes our reviewer Latha Anantharaman.‘Tiger Woman’: In a Barnum and Bailey worldIn 2014, a new edition of the travelogues of one of the most vivacious figures of the Bengal Renaissance, Priyanath Bose, came out. Bose who founded the Great Bengal Circus in 1887, established that Indians can well take on Europeans in gymnastics, vaudeville and animals acts. Sirsho Bandopadhyay’s 2016 Bengali novel,Shardulsundari, dramatised Bose’s life with élan — although, not unexpectedly, Bose’s travelogue itself is brimful of drama.Arunava Sinha’s expert translation keeps the excitement intact while serving to introduce a now-almost-forgotten Bengali pioneer to a larger audience, writes Anusua Mukherjee in her review.‘Newcomer: A Story of Death in Tokyo’: Death and the cityIn this latest story about a low-profile cop Kyoichiro Kaga, he has just been transferred to an old-fashioned Tokyo precinct where he himself is a curious stranger. This becomes an intriguing setting for a murder, though the crime appears — at least initially — merely to be an excuse for Kaga to spend days exploring the quaint alleys of the area.Keigo Higashino’s novel is perhaps mostly to be seen as a take on the classic Agatha Christie style of detective fiction but upgraded by about a 100 years into an entertaining Japanese-style mind game, writes our reviewer Zac O'Yeah.Here are a few other suggestions from our fiction bookshelf:'The Legacy of Nothing' by Manoj PandeyThis is a collection of stories “culled from the ennui of modern living”. A Maoist from Nepal; a victim of identity politics; a struggling musician — such nameless souls come together in these dark disjointed tales accompanied by stunning illustrations. Pandey is a writer and an illustrator based in New Delhi.'Sweet Shop' by Amit ChaudhariThe inspiration for this volume of poetry is Amit Chaudhuri’s visits to sweet shops in the by-lanes of Calcutta. The poems speak of what it means to discover, marvel at, and taste the universe. As the first line of the book says, “The whole universe is here”. The edible, the intimate, and the singular come together here.'Three Plays' by Annie ZaidiThis collection of plays by Annie Zaidi includes her most recent work, Untitled 1, which addresses current debates about free speech. The other pieces are Jam, which examines violence and “the devaluation of feminine labour”, and Name, Place, Animal, Thing, inspired by her concern for children who grow up as servants.'Something I Never Told You' by Shravya BhinderThis is about falling in and out of love. After an arduous wooing, Ronnie gets his first crush, Adira. As they get close and comfortable with each other, life takes on another hue. From magical it becomes routine as egos and doubts clash. Ronnie and Adira will probably never find their happily ever after.'To Kill the Truth' by Sam BourneFormer White House operative Maggie Costello has sworn off politics. But when the Governor of Virginia seeks her help to stop a series of killings, she knows that this is bigger than any political game. Black Lives Matter protestors clash with slavery deniers: the conspiracy could ignite a new civil war.NON FICTION‘Medical Education in Western India — Grant Medical College and Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy’s Hospital’ review: Interpreting maladiesThis book will be of interest not just to the medical profession, but also to administrators, students of history, and most general readers, writes our reviewer M.K. Mani.The only section that might bore the non-medical reader is that on details of the syllabus used in teaching, and the examination papers, and this is quite brief. On the other hand, medical personnel who have been educated and examined in modern times will relish this information.‘Business and Politics in India’ review: Coming up shortBusiness and Politics in India, as the title suggests, tries examine the accelerated shift in the balance of political power — in ways both direct and indirect — towards business. Scholars analyse the nature of business power and the manner in which it shapes political change in India.The population excluded by the market economy, the informal labour and rural segments, is unlikely to passively let business dominance over the state go unchecked beyond a point, writes Puja Mehra in her review.‘Dalit Literatures in India’ review: Voice of protestHow far and in which direction has Dalit literature travelled? The second edition of Dalit Literatures in India outlines efforts behind collection of scholarly articles written on various aspects of Dalit literature, its impact on awakening the community and the politics of protest by marginalised people from different regions in India.This volume, a collection of scholarly essays and research by over 20 authors, takes an in-depth look at Dalit literature. The essays have dissected and thoroughly analysed writings by Dalit authors to assess their literary value, writes our reviewer Prakash Bal Joshi.Here are a few other suggestions from our non-fiction bookshelf:'Political Parties, Party Manifestos and Elections in India, 1909-2014' by R.K. TiwariThis volume traces the evolution of the electoral system, political parties and party manifestos in India as they emerged and developed over time. It also analyses Constituent Assembly debates on the electoral system.'Ground Scorching Tax' by Arun KumarThe government launched the Goods and Services Tax on July 1, 2017, with an aim to bring about ease of doing business, increase tax collection, lower inflation, increase GDP growth and check the black economy. An economist explains why it has been beset with problems and confusion.'The Right to Sanitation in India: Critical Perspectives' edited by Philippe Cullet, Sujith Koonan, Lovleen BhullarThe right to sanitation has been recognised in India for more than two decades. This book analyses the role of the Swachh Bharat Mission, waste water treatment and re-use, and manual scavenging.'Doing Justice' by Preet BhararaFor eight years, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York prosecuted some of the most high-profile crimes. Called the ‘Sheriff of Wall Street’, and one of the first federal employees to be fired by Donald Trump, Bharara takes readers into America’s complex criminal justice system.'The Lives of Freda' by Andrew WhiteheadFrom the time Freda Houlston married B.P.L. Bedi at a registry office in Oxford in 1933, she regarded herself as Indian. She was English by birth and upbringing, and Indian by marriage, cultural affinity and political loyalty.

However, Mr. Ramachandran had expressed his wish to pull out and on Sunday, Mr. Venugopal also announced his disinclination to seek re-election from Alappuzha.KC(M) decisionMr. Chandy’s name has been doing the rounds, but a final call, especially on the choice of constituency, can be taken only after the Kerala Congress (M) sorts its internal differences out.Party leaders are unanimous in their view that Mr. Chandy’s presence in the fray will change the electoral dynamic of several constituencies in Central Travancore and a few outside this belt. With the Communist Party of India(Marxist) setting out to test the electoral arena with a “caste and religious formula” and the BJP zeroing in on a few constituencies hoping to capitalise on the polarisation caused by Sabarimala, Mr. Chandy is likely to face pressure from the High Command.Interestingly, it appears that both the UDF and the LDF have a shortage of candidates, prompting them to field sitting legislators and encash on their local appeal on the parliamentary canvass.MLAs in frayThe CPI(M) has fielded A.A. Arif, Aroor MLA, in Alappuzha and Veena George in Pathanamthitta, A. Pradeep Kumar in Kozhikode and P.V. Anwar in Ponnani, while the CPI has fielded legislators C. Divakaran and Chittayam Gopakumar.Adoor Prakash, Congress MLA from Konni, is being actively considered for Attingal or Alappuzha. The UDF will end up fielding two legislators if Mr. Chandy is also in the fray.The scrutiny committee would not overlook the fact that the CPI(M), led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, has not been doctrinaire in its candidate selection. The decision to field P. Jayarajan in Vadakara has also forced the Congress leadership to rethink its strategy. If Mr. Ramachadran sticks to his stand, it would prompt the Congress to support RMP leader K.K. Rema to focus on the cult of political violence promoted by the CPI(M).With Kerala going to the polls in the third phase, the Congress leadership has ample time to work on its election strategies and announce candidates. Congress president Rahul Gandhi will be in the State on March 14. According to Congress sources, the final list will be approved most probably by March 16."

A section of students have raised protests against a practice that is believed to be integral with the legacy of a college in Delhi
",,"On Valentine’s Day, the students of a college under Delhi University, worship a different woman celebrity every year, mostly an actress who is referred to as ‘Damdami Mayi’.Poojasare performed around a ‘Virgin Tree’ and condoms full of water are hung over it. The myth is that the participants in the ritual tend to lose their virginity within six months.This year, the protest against the practice generated conversation not just in the college but in the entire university. Across campuses, women have been struggling to end gender discrimination and this year the Progressive Front conveyed that they refuse to be passive observers of patriarchal jingoism.“The struggle against the V-tree has been building up for the last three years and this year, when the protesters refused to be passive and obedient, they were seen as threats to the college and its legacy. We are ashamed that the college thinks that a misogynistic practice is integral to its history. The voices that were raised this year will not be silenced till the university space becomes safe and conducive for all,” they said.“Students who had a problem with the event had been speaking to the organisers and students for two weeks prior to the event. Letters were also written to the college’s principal, but she refused to take any stance on the issue,” they added.Shift in approachAccording to Shaurya, a student, who was also one of the participants in the event, attempts were made by the boys’ hostel union to reform the practice. “This time, instead of a poster of a woman wearing revealing clothes, two posters were hung to promote the idea of love and marriage — one of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma and a rainbow poster which said: ‘Love knows no boundaries’” he said.“But the narrative was realigned easily to cutting the tree. To prevent this, we tried to form a human chain around the tree,” he added.However, one of the members of the Front said, “People were injured from both sides and several attempts were made at intimidating us even after the event. Nobody from our side initiated any violence. Whatever was done was only to counter the aggressive suppression of our voices.”The fight to create safe spaces for women still appears to be a far-fetched idea."

BJP is committed to ensuring justice for all: Rajnath Singh
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said that though the government will not claim to have ensured incident-free administration, there was massive improvement in internal security; Naxalism, which was earlier spread across 126 districts, is now limited to just about eight districts in the country while the North-East insurgency is down by 85 %.Addressing a meeting of intellectuals organised by Dakshina Kannada unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party here, Mr. Rajnath Singh said that the Kashmir problem was persisting only because of Pakistan. There was massive violence just when the NDA government came to power in 2014 where over 60 tribal people were killed in Assam. “I wound up the unified command meeting post-violence in just one minute and you imagine what instruction I would have given,” he said and added that thereafter insurgency reduced considerably in the North-East. He said that for every problem there is a solution and the government would definitely find one [for Kashmir]. “Our forces did whatever had to be done and accomplished the target-based mission.” “We neither attacked their military nor civilians as after all they are our neighbours,” he said, quoting late A.B. Vajpayee who had said that one could change a friend but not a neighbour.“However, following the air strike after the attack in Pulwama some in India were concerned and I don’t know what has happened to them. If any one is concerned about vote bank, that is not good. Politics should be for the country and not for power. They should be happy that the government did something,” he said. Mr. Rajnath Singh said that those indulging in vote bank politics are targeting the BJP as communal. “But we are clear — justice to all and appeasement of none,” he reiterated.Quoting economists, he said that the days are not far when India becomes one of the three super economic powers in the world.Stating that various policies of the government have empowered the common man, he urged intellectuals to vote for a strong government. “Forming a government with a majority after three decades, that too a non-Congress party, is not a small achievement,” he said.State BJP president B.S. Yeddyurappa, MPs Nalin Kumar Kateel and Shobha Karandlaje and others were present."

Tintin turned 90 this year and Asterix 60, but they have both proved ruinous to countless relationships across the world
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Back in the early 1990s, a friend’s marriage of barely a few weeks was very nearly wrecked because of — I kid you not — two comic-book characters. The story, to which I bore witness up-close, went like this: the girl’s father had an expansive collection of Tintin and Asterix comics, and my friend — a cherished son-in-law — presumed, not unreasonably, that in exercise of his conjugal rights, he could borrow a few at a time.But that expectation quickly ran into the iron force of the cussed father-in-law’s golden rule: that while the comics, which he typically kept locked away, could be read at home — and in his presence! — they were never to leave the house. I’ll say nothing about my pal’s outraged reaction other than that the chromatically resplendent epithets he unburdened himself of would have caused even Captain Haddock to turn as blue as those billions of blistering barnacles.It’s a fair bet that for all the joy they’ve infused in readers, Tintin — who, despite his eternally youthful Peter Pan looks, turned 90 in January — and Asterix, who will turn an ageless 60 in October, have proved similarly ruinous to countless other relationships. On fandom websites, there are entire discussion threads devoted to triumphalist claims about just how annoyingly possessive fans get with their comic-book collections.Vital statisticsThe question of just why these two unlikely characters — a Belgian reporter with a signature flipped-up tuft and the do-good ethic of a Boy Scout, and a mythical Gaul and a strategist who trounced foreign invaders centuries ago — inspire such passions or even appeal to millions of readers across cultures and age-groups around the world has proved puzzling to many.In Tintin’s case, Michael Farr, author ofTintin: The Complete Companion,notes that a key aspect of the popularity relates to the fact that these adventures can be appreciated at many levels. Tintin’s creator Georges Remi, alias Hergé (the French pronunciation of his initials ‘GR’ in reverse), struck gold “by devising a character who would appeal to children as much as grown-ups, though for often quite different reasons,” Farr writes. Typically, children are drawn to Tintin’s high-on-adrenaline adventures, his adorable, old-faithful fox terrier Snowy, and the comedic second-rung characters: from the tipple-happy sea-dog Captain Haddock to the spoonerism-afflicted Thomson and Thompson, to Bianca Castafiore, the operatic soprano with a glass-shattering voice. Adults find additional layers of resonance: clever wordplay, and allusions to real-world personalities and events — from revolutions to political convulsions.But in equal measure, some of Tintin’s old-world charm is born of the fact that he represents a throwback to an era when heroes did not wear capes or possess superpowers: instead, he solves cases and brings criminals to justice on the sheer strength of his ingenuity. Although a free-agent foreign correspondent with a seemingly limitless expense account is something of an anachronism today, Tintin also embodies a time when the “power of the printed word” was widely acknowledged — even by criminal elements who feared his exposés.Goody two-shoesIn all fairness, Tintin wasn’t always such an annoyingly squeaky-clean goody two-shoes. His first adventure, in Soviet Union in 1929, barely 12 years after the Communist revolution, was criticised for its excessively propagandist tone and its portrayal of Communism as undiluted evil — although, in Hergé’s defence, he accurately captured the essence of Soviet ‘Potemkin’ villages and the awe with which “useful idiots” from the West perceived the Bolshevik rule. In large part, the propagandist tone may have been influenced by Father Norbert Wallez, the right-wing cleric who ranLe Vingtième Siècle(The Twentieth Century), the conservative Catholic newspaper in Belgium, in which Hergé worked.Tintin’s next adventure, in the Belgian colony of Congo, was a bigger disaster. Hergé was accused of, among other things, outright racism and gruesome wildlife carnage. In one scene, Tintin drills a hole in a rhino’s thick hide, shoves in a dynamite stick, and sets it alight. After the rhino is blown to bits, he wryly says: “Perhaps the charge was a bit too strong.”Hergé would dismiss both the Soviet and the Congo episodes as “the indiscretions of my youth”. In subsequent interviews, he acknowledged with contrition that he had perhaps been fed the “prejudices of the bourgeois society in which I moved.” He further said he felt “remorse for having killed or caused to suffer too many animals inTintin in the Congo.”The Tintin of the later adventures comes across as politically correct — even excessively so. By the time of the 23rd adventure in the series, inTintin and the Picaros, he becomes so evolved as to insist that the revolution that Alcazar is plotting, to overthrow Tapioca, must be entirely bloodless. Similarly, inTintin in Tibet, the 20th adventure in the series, Hergé is perhaps so influenced by the spiritual aura of the Himalayan region that the entire episode is free of violence — or even villains. Even the Abominable Snowman comes across as an Adorable Snowman.There is one criticism, however, that the Tintin series has not been able to shake off: there is no central woman character, and — as one Tintinology researcher puts it — Tintin’s Boy-Scout world is characterised by “gynophobia”. Other than Bianca Castafiore, the channel of diva-esque comedic excess, the women characters in the series appear only as maids, landladies and gypsies.Hergé later defended himself, claiming that sentimentality had little place in Tintin’s stories — which, in any case, are about men getting into all sorts of “misadventures rather than adventures”. In such situations, he said, “mocking women” would not have been nice. Where the sight of a man slipping on a banana peel — which happens often enough — may come across as funny, he did not wish to subject women to such humiliations.Yin and yangAnd what accounts for the appeal of Asterix and Obelix, the indefatigable Gauls who hold out against the far more powerful Roman legionnaires? How is it that the two unlikely warriors “conquered”, as one commentator put it, more territory than Napolean? Central to it, in the opinion of illustrator Albert Uderzo (who, along with writer René Goscinny, brought the characters to life), is the triumph of the underdog in the eternal David-versus-Goliath battle. Asterix and Obelix also represent the union of ingenuity and brute force, of restrained wisdom and untamed raw energy, of yin and yang.But perhaps somewhat more so than the Tintin series, the Asterix comics reveal themselves and provide chuckle-inducing amusement for discerning readers who have a rudimentary understanding of Latin turns of phrases and the wordplays on names (of characters and places), and the clever puns that Goscinny wove in — which translate remarkably well across 111 languages and dialects.Illustratively, in the original French version, Obelix’s dog is calledIdéfix(which is a play onidée fixe,which means ‘fixed idea’ or an obsession of sorts); and the name in the English-language comic is Dogmatix, which retains the idea of an obsession, and additionally introduces the play on the word ‘dog’).The situational humour in the Asterix series is somewhat circular: here, too, a large part of it springs from the stereotyping of cultures, in Europe and elsewhere, and in the exaggerated caricature of traits that are portrayed as typifying communities. Where the thrill-inducing, danger-laced action in the Tintin series almost always proceeds at breakneck speed, with Asterix and Obelix, even the biff-bang fight sequences evoke laughter rather more than anxiety. That’s also because there is often a comforting familiarity to the sequences the warrior protagonists find themselves in.Poles apart(Somewhat curiously, a modern-day French activist campaigning against genetically modified food has modelled himself on Asterix, right down to a handlebar moustache. In much the same way that Asterix beats back invaders, José Bové, a sheep farmer in Aveyron in the Midi-Pyrénées region, is pushing back against the ‘invasion’ by McDonald’s.)For all that they have in common as comic-book heroes whose fame has spread around the world, Tintin and Asterix are also poles apart on one distinctive count. The Tintin series takes itself excessively seriously, with the earnestness of a Boy Scout. Not all the jollity and the comedic influences of the second-rung characters can detract from the fact that Tintin is, in many ways, a wannabe peacenik mahatma who will never veer from the path of political correctness and will not give himself over to gastronomic or other sensory excesses. You can count on him to readily throw himself intoMission Impossiblesituations, but he is fundamentally incapable of laughing at himself. He is too much of anadarsh balak.Asterix and Obelix, on the other hand, are completely uninhibited about celebrating the slapstick and over-the-top tomfoolery — and even the occasional gratuitous violence. And they know how to party. Hanging around with them may be bad for my cholesterol levels, but, by Toutatis! — unless the sky falls on my head — there’s no place else I’d rather be.Tintin embodies a time when the ‘power of the printed word’ was widely acknowledgedAsterix and Obelix, unlike Tintin, are uninhibited about celebrating the slapstick and over-the-top tomfoolery — and even the occasional gratuitous violence"

‘Kalia the Crow’,Tinkle’s oldest series, gets a reboot with a bigger forest and more animals
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Joumana Haddad was named one of the world’s 100 most powerful Arab women for four years in a row byArabian Businessmagazine. The Lebanese writer, journalist, and activist has several collections of essays, poetry and translations to her credit, includingI Killed ScheherazadeandSuperman is an Arab.She has received the Blue Metropolis Arab Literary Prize and the Arab Press prize, among other honours. Excerpts from an interview:You grew up in war-torn Lebanon in the 70s and 80s. What role did books play in your life then?Books and reading literally saved my life. Everything around me was the opposite of living: violence, fear, corpses... But books allowed me to have hope, to dream of a possible future, to imagine I have what I did not have, to grow in the womb of knowledge, acceptance, and love. They were — and still are — my self-healing power.You started writing poetry at a very young age. What were your early poems about?My first poem was titled ‘Freedom’. Most of my early poems, which I used to write in French, revolved around the life I longed to have: liberation, adventure, romance, tomorrow... They were revenge for reality in a way.Was your family supportive of your literary pursuits? Did they discourage you because ‘good’ girls are meant to focus on finding a husband and raising kids?My parents were different on that level. My father was an avid reader and my earliest memory is of him returning home after a long workday to sit down and read after eating. He was a very conservative man, but when it came to education, both his son and daughter had to excel. My mother was also a big support. Despite the fact that she was not highly educated, or maybe because of it, she sacrificed a lot to give us a good education. She also had huge ambitions for us, which made us strive to live up to her expectations.Your poems in Arabic are passionate and explicit. Rebelling against convention in a society that prizes a woman’s ‘modesty’ can’t have been easy?In the beginning it didn’t feel like rebellion, because I was merely being true to myself and saying what I wanted to say, which is the obligation and right of every writer (and human). I didn’t write in order to provoke, but being transparent in a hypocritical society entrenched in taboos was inevitably a form of rebellion. Despite all the insults, resistance, threats, and forms of censorship, it was all so worth it. Nothing satisfies me more than practising my right to be myself against all odds: whether in my words, books or life. Being true and resisting masks is one of the most necessary individual and collective revolutions in the world.Poetry, fiction, non-fiction — do you have a favourite?My thoughts and ideas are free to choose which form they want to be born in. I hate boxes, especially the ones we impose on ourselves.You are fluent in seven languages. Do you make a conscious choice about which language to use when writing?Just like I never decide the genre, I never choose the language: I let myself be chosen and transported!You are a vocal critic of sexism. At what age did you became conscious of the skewed balance of power between the sexes?Very early. In a society like mine, you cannot but notice it. In everyday life as much as in the big picture of the political and economical systems and laws. It’s like the elephant in the room. You cannot miss an elephant, even if many pretend it’s not there.How would you describe the current status of women in Lebanon?We are far back in the road towards emancipation and justice, despite the mirage of freedom that some women in Lebanon may enjoy. The system is extremely patriarchal and women’s participation in politics is low because of this. There are still many archaic laws. As long as half of society is not part of the decision-making process, we will not advance. But we are pushing and pushing, and the wall is bound to be torn down by our efforts one day.What does freedom mean to you?Freedom is an endless quest, and it has many meanings. To me, it is mainly about the right to just ‘be’ and ‘live’, as opposed to the act of ‘pretending’ and ‘surviving.’Do you write with the hope that your words can topple existing power structures?I never write with the intent or pretension that I can change the world. Not even a grain of sand in it… I write because I need to. Because I cannot ‘not write.’ It’s not a mission, but a vital necessity. One day when I discovered that what I wrote sometimes inspires or helps or consoles others, I was in awe. That’s the magic of books. The personal becomes universal or collective, and the change starts to happen without you having specifically sought it.You continue to live in Lebanon despite being threatened by politicians and conservatives. Why stay on in a country that loves to hate you?I believe real change can only come from within. You cannot import progress. I want to live the same lives of my people, experience the same suffering, endure the same struggles, face the same frustrations in order to be worthy of helping and changing all that injustice. If I’m not feeling the pain, I have no right to participate in the healing.The interviewer is the author ofA Happy Place And Other Stories.Books allowed me to have hope, to dream of a possible future, to imagine I have what I did not have, to grow in the womb of knowledge and loveI didn’t write in order to provoke, but being transparent in a hypocritical society entrenched in taboos was inevitably a form of rebellion.

When the monsoon comes, rainfall will be intense in these parts, and will continue for many months. This is coffee terrain.With the great tall trees above us, and the plantation ahead of us, we have been walking on this narrow path for a while now. A turn ahead; the path narrows further, then opens into a small courtyard. A modest, single-storey structure comes into sight. The local anganwadi.Outside, the ground has been swept clean and decorated with a rangoli. On the side is a neat line of children’s shoes.The hall is long, with a low tiled roof. The children come running up to us. Along the length of the walls are painted murals of the fauna of the nearby Nagarhole forest: tiger, leopard, elephant, gaur, deer.Sunlight spills on to the cool floor. We sit cross-legged in a circle with the children. Circle time gives a feeling of warmth and trust.Namaste, makkale, I say. Hello, children!.NAMASTE! yell the children in unison.Chennagiddira? Are you well, I ask.HOUDU!!NAAVU CHENNAGIDIVI! YES, WE ARE FINE, they yell.I smother a giggle.They are quick to notice. Mmppheheheheheheheh, they burst into a long collective physical giggle, as children do, and it runs round the circle like a tiny Mexican wave.Thindi aayita? Have you had anything to eat or drink today?MILK! WE DRANK MILK, is the reply.Why should we come to the anganwadi, I ask.They take a moment to think about this question. And then a little boy leaps up to answer.So that we can learn THINGS and drink MILK and grow up BIG and STRONG, he shouts, stretching out his arms to show me just how big and strong. He has the brightest eyes I have seen.I ask him his name. Rahul, he says, and he is four years old. He sits down again with a grin. Suddenly, a tiny little girl jumps into his lap and bursts into wails. The anganwadi teacher tells me she is Rahul’s sister, Aishwarya, 2.

Close to half a century later, with about 1.4 million anganwadis in 7,000 blocks and around 2.8 million frontline personnel, India is still grappling with child malnutrition.The children are given milk and mid-day meals at the anganwadis.

Stunting in children is associated with underdeveloped brains and long-term harmful consequences for learning capacity, school performance, and later earning ability. Persistent undernutrition is a matter of deep concern, especially in the context of successive and severe droughts in many parts of the country. A stunting level of 38% (NFHS4, 2015-16) means 38% of our young are growing up with impaired development.Poorest left outTwo important recent publications speak to this troubling problem. The first, an IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) study of equity and extent of coverage of ICDS from 2006 to 2016, found that the proportion of respondents using ICDS had increased substantially in the period under study. However, the poorest sections of the population were still left out, especially in States with the highest levels of malnutrition.The second is an insightful paper published recently by retired civil servant V. Ramani, who led Maharashtra’s pioneering Nutrition Mission. He points out that 50 districts, some larger than entire countries, figure at the bottom of the table in international comparisons of child stunting. According to Ramani, beyond the need for ICDS to be resourced better, and its presence expanded (without ICDS, child malnutrition in urban slums could be similar to those in tribal areas) the following aspects also require immediate attention — improved programme design, especially in supplementary and maternal nutrition; sharper focus on the health-ICDS synergy; more local government involvement; and decentralised data to guide frontline workers and improve service delivery.Tackling malnutrition is not a one-time affair. It requires a lifecycle approach that addresses a gamut of issues — undernutrition among girls, child marriage, discrimination against girls and women in households. It requires multisectoral and convergent interventions from the government and civil society that covers infrastructure, sanitation and clean drinking water.The anganwadis follow an activity-based, environment-embedded Montessori curriculum.

In doing this, a space for solidarity among mothers can be created through informal social networks. Besides, it could help build sustainable livelihoods for local women’s groups in dairy, egg and vegetable production. A long-term plan should look at using technology to bring convergence among frontline health and nutrition workers so that every last woman and child can be reached. These are complex innovations, but they are doable.Holisticand non-formalFinally, and not least of all, beyond nutrition and health, the anganwadi can be a rich and vibrant centre for early learning activities. Rather than make them huddle over worksheets, the anganwadi can enable their holistic development through non-formal activities.Indeed, that’s how it began. The idea of the anganwadi drew imaginative power from the work of pioneering Gandhian educators Tarabai Modak and Anutai Wagh, as well as the educational philosophies of Gandhi, Tagore and J. Krishnamurthi.Modak and Wagh drew their child-centred pedagogy from the work of Italian educationist Maria Montessori, and set it in an Indian context. Montessori came into the field of early childhood education when she started the Casa dei Bambini, literally ‘Children’s Home’, for children from low-income families whose parents were at work. She discovered that when children found themselves in an environment where they had activities designed to support learning, they were able to learn independently. Her educational pedagogy focused on the maxim: ‘First the education of the senses, then the education of the intellect’.Montessori not only visited Shantiniketan in 1939 but stayed in India for seven years during World War II, training over a thousand Indian teachers in child-centred early education. In their correspondence, Tagore and Montessori discussed the limitations of what he described as the “officialised system of education” prevalent in India. For Montessori, the child was “both the hope and the promise of humankind.”Modak, called the ‘Montessori Mother’ of India, graduated from the University of Bombay in 1914, became the first Indian woman principal of a women’s college, and gave it all up to start the first early education centre. After years of work in Mumbai, coming under the influence of Gandhian ideas on basic education, Modak decided to move her work to a coastal community in Thane. B.G. Kher, then Chief Minister of Bombay, inaugurated the project: “Tarabai came to this village with the blessings of Mahatma Gandhi. She is sowing the seeds of child education. This seed will grow into a big tree and spread all over India.”Wagh, widowed within six months of marriage by the age of 13, did her matriculation by enrolling in night school and joined Modak in her work. They developed the programme by inviting children in with songs, processions, and mornings spent clearing dry grass with child-sizedkurpis(sickles). When they realised the children were hungry, they began feeding them too. They called the centres ‘balwadis’ (literally, orchards of children) and ‘anganwadis’ (courtyard schools).Twigs, pebbles and leavesTheir activity-based, environment-embedded Montessori curriculum for Indian conditions used what Wagh called “collections of interesting objects” such as feathers, seeds, twigs, pebbles, flowers, and leaves. They were influenced by Gandhi’s idea of education as the “all-round drawing out of the best in child and human — body, mind and spirit”. Modak and Wagh believed that in order to keep the early education programme truly localised and sustainable, the balwadi teachers should themselves make or assemble play materials, using locally-available resources, or get them made by local artisans.Wagh’s classic 1979 manual,How to Run a Balwadi, speaks of the beautiful, humane vision of the Thane tribal project. Children began their learning activities out in the open. Every single thing was a learning activity, starting with: ‘To wander about’; ‘To water plants’; ‘To fill in alpana designs with flowers and seeds.’Today, in many ways, local communities are still carrying forward this great project. The anganwadi is at the heart of the community. Many anganwadi workers collect seeds and pebbles to teach games, texture and numeracy. Parents often gift uniforms to the children so that their anganwadi is nothing “less” than a private preschool. A tailor father gets the uniforms stitched at his tailoring unit. A mason father uses colourful tiles to create patterns on the anganwadi floor. A young MSW graduate, now married and pregnant, comes daily to the anganwadi to have her hot meal and meet her friends.A Halakki Vokkaliga grandmother, a forest tribal woman in Karwar, walks her grandchild to the anganwadi, waits for him, and walks him back every day. A group of former sex workers takes a loan to set up a unit to supply chikkis to anganwadis.A gram panchayat member gifts vegetables and coconuts from her orchard to the anganwadi each week. A grandmother exclaims that since the anganwadis are serving hot meals to mothers, she will offer homemadeuppinkai(pickle). An anganwadi supervisor who has a haemoglobin level of 8 has begun to take better care of herself. An anganwadi helper growssoppu, green leafy vegetables, in innovatively recycled foodgrain bags, to add nutritive value to the children’s meals.I could go on. But the fact is, it’s time to see how, despite the challenges, anganwadis make a difference in the life of the local community: in working for the well-being of mothers and children, enabling the labour force participation of women, and guiding the social and emotional development of little ones. Every anganwadi can be a way to ensure that health and nutrition services reach the village; every anganwadi toilet means a generation of young children will grow up with reduced exposure to soil-borne diseases and diarrhoea. Every anganwadi means safe childcare, while mothers earn a livelihood, on an MGNREGA site or agricultural field, in a garment factory or in domestic work. Additional income for mothers also means families are better off economically, with reduced vulnerability to domestic violence — and a better future for the children.****It is December, and we are in the village of Asoga, by the banks of the Malaprabha river. On the riverbank is a small medieval temple from the Kadamba period. The anganwadi supervisor tells me that this is where, in the filmAbhimaan(1973), Amitabh Bachchan first sees Jaya Bhaduri and hears her sing ‘Nadiya Kinare’.Inside the anganwadi, the children have had their lunch, and are napping on the floor. Outside, there is a papaya tree, and a small kitchen garden planted with greens.In the years to come, children from this anganwadi will enrol in the nearby school. They will be a healthier and better nourished generation. They will be well-adjusted, will learn better and miss fewer days of school because of better immunity. They will have a better future.The beautiful artwork on the anganwadi walls says, in Marathi and Kannada,Vidya Heche Vaibhava.Vidyeye Balina Belaku. Education is the light of life.And the anganwadi system is trying to ensure that it lights up the lives of these children.The writer is in the IAS, currently based in Bengaluru."
Achilles vs fighter jet,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/achilles-vs-fighter-jet/article26485518.ece,"
The heroes of the epics were complex figures. Their counterparts today are dehumanised
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The history of the ‘hero’ as a category of description in popular imagination is surprisingly fragile and also complex. It is fragile because a hero is born of a marriage of circumstance and wilful action, and is midwived into this world by a fleeting rearrangement of what is considered possible — when our present world, one filled with all-too-familiar cause-and-effect, splits to reveal another, improbable world. A world wherein a 1970s MiG-21 can shoot down an advanced F-16 jet in a dogfight. In due course, this story of improbability accretes around it a halo of awe.The idea of a hero is held together in public memory by a carapace of sentiments cemented by an insinuation of greatness, and ultimately baked dry as a fact by the very act of repetitive narration. All the while, inside this collectively architected reality lies the truth of the heroic action, which is obscured for all but the hero himself.Traditionally, what is meant by a ‘hero’ is itself complex: is it one who wars valiantly against the die of fate cast by the gods (say, Karna in theMahabharata) or one so extravagantly blessed by the gods that his mere presence is an event (say, Achilles in theIliad).In our secular age too, intuitions about the heroic are still born from the wellspring of violence — Somnath Sharma at Badgam in 1947, Arun Khetarpal at Bara Pind in 1971, Vikram Batra at Point 4875 in 2001, or Sandeep Unnikrishnan at the Taj, Mumbai in 2008.Homer and BharataIn ancient Greece, a world where violence was frequent and often eulogised, we find that narratives of Homer and those inspired by him tend to have three characteristics.One, all heroes are born from war. Two, the hero often faces a choice between a long, middling life or a shorter, glorious. And third, others are uncertain about how to think of the hero — is he to be venerated, or merely respected?The heroic mode is as much an internal one as it is one about the responses of others. In contrast, the taxonomies of the heroic mode in Bharata’sNatya Shastra—Dhirodatta Nayaka,Dhiralalita Nayaka,Dhiraprashanta Nayakaetc. — are preoccupied with an underlying psychology.The hero is a means of embodying a complex set of emotional valences constrained by social prescription and emotional maturity. In neither of these understandings does being heroic come without costs.Upon coming face to face with his enemy Priam, all Achilles could do was admire him; he “watched his handsome face and listened to his words”. In that penultimate moment before executing his eternal enemy Karna, even the great Arjuna baulks for a moment — his humanity burbles past the barbarisms of a holocaust at Kurukshetra.In contrast to these traditional understandings of the hero as a complex being, in our modern media narratives, the ‘hero’ is a placeholder, into which an inchoate attachment and highly particularised ‘patriotism’ pours in. This patriotism is reducible to a specific set of actions that allows for convenient demarcations of good and evil, a cartoonish portrayal that has little interest in the everyday lives of soldiers in a warrior culture.In her illuminating essay on theIliad, the French philosopher Simone Weil writes about ‘force’, which permeates all instances of violence,. She defines ‘force’ as an intervention which changes any human into a phantom approximation of the living.It is this dehumanising urge that informs hero-narratives in our media. Our understanding of the heroic is progressively limited to the ability to kill or avoid being killed.This implies that today’s anointed heroes will cease to matter by tomorrow’s news cycle. More troublingly, it means our understanding of the security forces, their struggles and strifes — all become irrelevant in the relentless need to manufacture new heroes.On coming face to face with his enemy Priam, all Achilles could do was “watch his handsome face and listen to his words”"

The Indian anganwadi is the world’s biggest mother and child nutrition and care programme. Despite the many flaws, it is getting some things heartwarmingly right
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is an early spring morning. We are walking deep inside hilly country in Karnataka’s Malnad region. When the monsoon comes, rainfall will be intense in these parts, and will continue for many months. This is coffee terrain.With the great tall trees above us, and the plantation ahead of us, we have been walking on this narrow path for a while now. A turn ahead; the path narrows further, then opens into a small courtyard. A modest, single-storey structure comes into sight. The local anganwadi.Outside, the ground has been swept clean and decorated with a rangoli. On the side is a neat line of children’s shoes.The hall is long, with a low tiled roof. The children come running up to us. Along the length of the walls are painted murals of the fauna of the nearby Nagarhole forest: tiger, leopard, elephant, gaur, deer.Sunlight spills on to the cool floor. We sit cross-legged in a circle with the children. Circle time gives a feeling of warmth and trust.Namaste, makkale, I say. Hello, children!.NAMASTE! yell the children in unison.Chennagiddira? Are you well, I ask.HOUDU!!NAAVU CHENNAGIDIVI! YES, WE ARE FINE, they yell.I smother a giggle.They are quick to notice. Mmppheheheheheheheh, they burst into a long collective physical giggle, as children do, and it runs round the circle like a tiny Mexican wave.Thindi aayita? Have you had anything to eat or drink today?MILK! WE DRANK MILK, is the reply.Why should we come to the anganwadi, I ask.They take a moment to think about this question. And then a little boy leaps up to answer.So that we can learn THINGS and drink MILK and grow up BIG and STRONG, he shouts, stretching out his arms to show me just how big and strong. He has the brightest eyes I have seen.I ask him his name. Rahul, he says, and he is four years old. He sits down again with a grin. Suddenly, a tiny little girl jumps into his lap and bursts into wails. The anganwadi teacher tells me she is Rahul’s sister, Aishwarya, 2. She weeps softly in her brother’s lap and he comforts her with a hug.The anganwadi teacher tells me later that the children’s mother has left home. Their father and grandmother work in the plantation.

Lebanese writer-activist-journalist Joumana Haddad talks of how being true to oneself is the obligation of every writer and human being ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Joumana Haddad was named one of the world’s 100 most powerful Arab women for four years in a row byArabian Businessmagazine. The Lebanese writer, journalist, and activist has several collections of essays, poetry and translations to her credit, includingI Killed ScheherazadeandSuperman is an Arab.She has received the Blue Metropolis Arab Literary Prize and the Arab Press prize, among other honours. Excerpts from an interview:You grew up in war-torn Lebanon in the 70s and 80s. What role did books play in your life then?Books and reading literally saved my life. Everything around me was the opposite of living: violence, fear, corpses... But books allowed me to have hope, to dream of a possible future, to imagine I have what I did not have, to grow in the womb of knowledge, acceptance, and love. They were — and still are — my self-healing power.You started writing poetry at a very young age. What were your early poems about?My first poem was titled ‘Freedom’. Most of my early poems, which I used to write in French, revolved around the life I longed to have: liberation, adventure, romance, tomorrow... They were revenge for reality in a way.Was your family supportive of your literary pursuits? Did they discourage you because ‘good’ girls are meant to focus on finding a husband and raising kids?My parents were different on that level. My father was an avid reader and my earliest memory is of him returning homeafter a long workday to sit down and read after eating. He was a very conservative man, but when it came to education, both his son and daughter had to excel. My mother was also a big support. Despite the fact that she was not highly educated, or maybe because of it, she sacrificed a lot to give us a good education. She also had huge ambitions for us, which made us strive to live up to her expectations.Your poems in Arabic are passionate and explicit. Rebelling against convention in a society that prizes a woman’s ‘modesty’ can’t have been easy?In the beginning it didn’t feel like rebellion, because I was merely being true to myself and saying what I wanted to say, which is the obligation and right of every writer (and human). I didn’t write in order to provoke, but being transparent in a hypocritical society entrenched in taboos was inevitably a form of rebellion. Despite all the insults, resistance, threats, and forms of censorship, it was all so worth it. Nothing satisfies me more than practising my right to be myself against all odds: whether in my words, books or life. Being true and resisting masks is one of the most necessary individual and collective revolutions in the world.Poetry, fiction, non-fiction — do you have a favourite?My thoughts and ideas are free to choose which form they want to be born in. I hate boxes, especially the ones we impose on ourselves.You are fluent in seven languages. Do you make a conscious choice about which language to use when writing?Just like I never decide the genre, I never choose the language: I let myself be chosen and transported!You are a vocal critic of sexism. At what age did you became conscious of the skewed balance of power between the sexes?Very early. In a society like mine, you cannot but notice it. In everyday life as much as in the big picture of the political and economical systems and laws. It’s like the elephant in the room. You cannot miss an elephant, even if many pretend it’s not there.How would you describe the current status of women in Lebanon?We are far back in the road towards emancipation and justice, despite the mirage of freedom that some women in Lebanon may enjoy. The system is extremely patriarchal and women’s participation in politics is low because of this. There are still many archaic laws. As long as half of society is not part of the decision-making process, we will not advance. But we are pushing and pushing, and the wall is bound to be torn down by our efforts one day.What does freedom mean to you?Freedom is an endless quest, and it has many meanings. To me, it is mainly about the right to just ‘be’ and ‘live’, as opposed to the act of ‘pretending’ and ‘surviving.’Do you write with the hope that your words can topple existing power structures?I never write with the intent or pretension that I can change the world. Not even a grain of sand in it… I write because I need to. Because I cannot ‘not write.’ It’s not a mission, but a vital necessity. One day when I discovered that what I wrote sometimes inspires or helps or consoles others, I was in awe. That’s the magic of books. The personal becomes universal or collective, and the change starts to happen without you having specifically sought it.You continue to live in Lebanon despite being threatened by politicians and conservatives. Why stay on in a country that loves to hate you?I believe real change can only come from within. You cannot import progress. I want to live the same lives of my people, experience the same suffering, endure the same struggles, face the same frustrations in order to be worthy of helping and changing all that injustice. If I’m not feeling the pain, I have no right to participate in the healing.The interviewer is the author ofA Happy Place And Other Stories."

India and Pakistan must re-imagine the border as a fold of peace instead of as a threshold of hostilities ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"One of the things I miss in the age of TV and digital news is the presence of the storyteller. Maybe it is an old-fashioned need, but I miss the magic of the moment that begins, ‘once there was’. Our sense of peace is desperately in need of myths and storytellers. In fact, as we watch the Pulwama event and after, we sense peace has lost autonomy as a narrative. Peace has been reduced to the lull between two acts of violence, an uneasy interlude. Our sense of war reads peace passively as a cessation of hostilities. Peace is more holistic and comprehensive in a way our current narratives do not capture. It is a different world. While war is anchored on the parochialism of concepts like border, security and nation state, peace has to dig deep into the unconscious of theology, philosophy and civilisation to literally create an alternative world view. India desperately needs a peace movement.Beyond machismoOur present vision of history and politics has become a handicap here. There is an irony to the Gandhian movement in India. Satyagraha as an imagination has inspired exemplars abroad, including Václav Havel, Martin Luther King, Jr., Thomas Merton and Desmond Tutu, but it has lost its passion and vigour in India. Today the Gandhian movement has died out, while Gandhians still play a role in other battles of resistance, such as the Narmada. Our ashrams are no longer pilgrimages of the imagination. They need to be revived to counter the think tanks of war and a middle class which craves the machismo of militarism.Also ReadParley | ‘Abhinandan’s release was a saving grace for both sides’What makes the dyingness of Gandhian ideas even more poignant is that violence and war have become technologically and strategically inventive, creating an acceptable normalcy around genocidal deaths. We read body counts with more indifference than weather reports. It is time peace as goodness challenges the inventiveness of war. As Gandhi pointed out, to be inventive, peace has to be both cognitive and ethical. It has to go beyond moral rhetoric and create experimental possibilities of peace, and it has to transform ethics into a political act that transforms the dullness of current democracy. Second, peace has to be seen as a craft, a lived world of meaning, not as a technocratic exercise. It needs daily rituals of practice where life, livelihood, lifestyle follow the codes of non-violence. For example, food has become a source of violence both as production and consumption. One has to rethink the logic of food as part of the testament of peace. The start-ups for peace have to be more imaginative than the usual start-ups of technology. Food as a cross-cultural imagination can help create the myths of diversity, generosity and justice that peace thrives on.Also ReadKashmir conundrumOne has to also create a tradition of peace, a genealogy of exemplars and anecdotes, myth and folklore that sustain our everyday sense of life and living. Sadly, while we have many exemplars, we have few paradigms with which peace can confront the arrogance of war. We need a flood of peace hypotheses, efforts of men like Rajni Kothari, Kuldip Nayar, Johan Galtung and the folklore that went with it. Without a folklore of peace, a civilisational store of proverbs and wisdom, a social science of peace would be arid and administrative. The role of the university and civil society becomes critical because one of the institutions India has to dream of is a new University of Peace. The University of Peace was dreamt of by Patrick Geddes, watching the ruins of the League of Nations. He planned a model of peace where knowledge created frameworks of peace. Knowledge was to be a civics of peace. Tagore wove this idea into the idea of Shantiniketan. This other Shantiniketan did not survive and needs to be revived as India’s creative answer to war and Partition. Civil society must take a leaf out of Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s book and create a new vision of the soldiers of peace, the Khudai Khidmatgars. Imagine peace groups working on both sides of the India-Pakistan border in a dialogue of peace. This will help us rethink the idea of the border as a threshold of hostilities, a hinge of war rather than a fold of peace. Today we see people on the border as vulnerable. One needs to give them some sense of agency in creating counter-currents to war. Finally, one needs civilisational ideas on war, where a dialogue of religion creates an antidote to war. The role of religion in peace is particularly crucial as our conventional spiritual leaders have become handymen of the state.No democracy without peaceOne has to recognise while there is a poetics to peace, there is also a prose to routine. Time and the varieties of time become crucial in understanding peace. Waiting for peace is almost the everyday burden of women in war zones as they wait for their loved ones to come back, and dream of the return to normalcy. I remember Manipuri activist Irom Sharmila once telling me that normalcy meant returning to the possibility of being a woman, falling in love, going for walks untrammelled by army interrogation. Normalcy is such a rare phenomenon in frontier areas where war and insurgency have become endemic. Democracy, in that sense, is an ode to normalcy, to the rhythms of being we call peace. Recently there was a demonstration of Naga students in Delhi. The group did not ask for rights or critique the brutality of the state. All they said was that they were tired of war, tired of waiting for peace. All they wanted was peace in their lifetime, which Indian democracy is duty bound to give.Also ReadThe language of PakistanOnce one realises peace is a craft, one has to prepare for it. One needs to see dialogue in creative ways. One is reminded of Raimon Panikkar’s definition that dialogue is a pilgrimage where one encounters the difference of the other to discover oneself. India and Pakistan need a dialogue in the sense that Panikkar spoke about. In this context, a dialogue of the people must be accompanied by more specialised dialogues. India has a chance to revive the power of the Pugwash movement. One has to remember that the first Pugwash conference was to meet in India till Cyrus Eaton hijacked it to Nova Scotia, his birthplace. The new Pugwash should go beyond nuclear fiefdoms and challenge the inventiveness of violence. It provides an opportunity for the satyagrahi and the scientist to blend in creative ways. The encounter between India and Pakistan must create wider models for thinking about peace.Guns and cultureIndia as a civilisation, a nation state and a democracy has a major resource to fall back on in the wisdom of our cultures and civilisations. It reminds me of an oft-repeated story from the Nazi era. Once the Nazi Minister for Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, claimed that every time he heard the word culture, he reached for his gun. The fittest reply came from a scholar, a Harvard professor called Alexander Gerschenkron. He replied that every time he heard the guns, he reached for his culture. It is time India goes beyond the grammar of surgical strikes and reaches for its cultures of peace, pilgrimage and understanding.Shiv Visvanathan is an academic associated with the Compost Heap, a group in pursuit of alternative ideas and imagination"

Women come out of the woods: collectivisation in rural Maharashtra,https://www.thehindu.com/society/women-come-out-of-the-woods-collectivisation-in-rural-maharashtra/article26468461.ece,"
Gadchiroli’s women first came together to protest mining in their forests. Now, they’re calling the shots ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Two years ago, when 87 villages from Korchi in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district came together to form a Maha Gramsabha to better represent villagers’ issues, something historic happened. Women from the Mahila Parishad, a collective of self-help groups, insisted on at least 50% women being represented in the Sabha. The villagers agreed, and now the Maha Sabha consists of two women and two men from each Gram Sabha. The executive committee has women office-bearers, such as a treasurer and a facilitator.“We insisted on 50%,” recollects Kumari Bai Jamkata, as we chat in a blue-ceilinged office room. She monitors 40 self-help groups in Korchi, and she and some others are now training Gram Sabha members in accounting and auditing.The larger fight against oppressive forest policies began decades ago, when the first mining companies came to this region. And it’s the women who have always been at the forefront of the resistance movement. Now, however, they have begun to widen their sphere of influence.Traditionally, the only forum that addressed justice for women who faced harassment from the family or society was a Jat Panchayat, where male elders would deliberate and pronounce verdict. But the Mahila Parishad began to slowly assert a voice to change a tradition that excluded and crushed women.“Our journey has not been easy, and is often strongly resisted by men,” says Jamkata. “But there is a gradual realisation that women’s issues are community issues.”The Mahila Parishad women have made demands like the rights of women to inherit land, equal benefits from non-timber forest produce sales, and a ban on alcohol consumption in the villages, demands that are slowly being accepted.Flower powerWomen in the region began to collectivise over two decades ago, with the limited objective of gaining a modicum of financial independence. Soon, the Mahila Parishad became a space where women could talk about their everyday lives: domestic violence, health, education. “The Parishad has always been working for the legal empowerment of women, monitoring government health schemes, the condition of girls in local boarding schools, and other social issues,” says Shubhada Deshmukh of Amhi Amchya Arogyasathi, an NGO that works with women in Gadchiroli.It’s a public hearing in Gadchiroli. Village elders, government officers and corporate representatives are gathered together. Naro Bai Hodi, a Mahila Parishad member, is speaking. “The forest is where we get our food, fruits, leaves and flowers. This is where our development will happen. If this forest is given to a mining company, we will become slaves. Mining won’t bring development.”That was a decade ago. The fight is not yet over: Today, there are 24 proposed and sanctioned mining leases impacting approximately 15,000 hectares of forests and hundreds of families. About 12 of these leases are in Korchi, impacting over 1,000 hectares of forest.By 2011, 87 Gram Sabhas had won the right to use, manage, and conserve their traditional forests or community forest resources, among other rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. In 2014, they were given ownership rights over non-timber forest produce such as tendu leaves and bamboo. The Gram Sabha slowly became the first unit of decision-making overtaking the panchayat. It’s these progressive Gram Sabhas that came together to create the Maha Sabha, making each Gram Sabha more inclusive, transparent, and accountable.“We now conduct Gram Sabha meetings at a time convenient for women,” says Izam Katengey, a male community leader from Salhe village who has passionately supported the Parishad’s efforts.Korchi taluka today is one of the few in the country where a few forest families have received individual land titles under the Forest Rights Act, given jointly to a couple or exclusively to the woman. In at least one village all the profits from the sale of non-timber forest produce have been transferred to the women’s account — a powerful and unique decision.“I want my daughter to have a better life, and for her dreams to come true. She should get her rights tojal, jangal, andzameen(water, forest and land),” says Kalpana Naitam, the feisty young sarpanch of Bori village, newly elected to her post.Additional inputs from Neema Pathak Broome (Kalpavriksh, Pune) and Mukesh Shende (Amhi Amchya Arogyasath, Korchi)The writer is with Kalpavriksh, Pune."
How to spot an anti-national,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-to-spot-an-anti-national/article26470953.ece,"
But first, what is ‘nation’ and ‘national’ ? ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"If you call someone an ‘anti’-something it is imperative to first define that something. Therefore, the first step towards defining an ‘anti-national’ is clarifying what we mean by ‘nation’ and ‘national’. In India’s case, we see ourselves as a democratic republic, so to define our nation we have to first define what we mean by the word ‘democratic’.Cutting past the maze of etymology, the simplest definition of a democracy is a country ruled by a government elected by a majority of the adult population; at the same time the national government rules the country in partnership with democratically elected state governments, who in turn work with municipal corporations and village panchayats.Besides, the elected governments at all levels cannot just do what they want — there are checks and balances from the police, the civil administration, the judiciary and, if recent laws were actually being followed, Lokpals at different levels to guard against corruption. Outside the grid of officialdom, a democratic nation’s media is also supposed to fearlessly provide non-official checks.Checks and balancesThe fundamental principle of a modern democracy, then, is that no one branch is allowed to run away with power. The very idea of checks and balances means that each branch has the right to question the other branches. This means that while elected politicians have administrative control over the police forces, the police also have the right to question, arrest or charge any government official if there is evidence that they have broken the law.Besides the obvious example of the ongoing Mueller investigation into the actions of the U.S. President, there are now official charges against Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu that could put him in jail; to take one other instance, in the 70s, Japanese Premier Kakuei Tanaka was convicted for corruption and arrested after his term.Even as the branches of government have the right and the duty to question each other, so do people have the right to ask questions of the governments they have elected and of the officials those governments have appointed, whether in civil administration, the police, the judiciary or the armed forces.All this boils down to one fundamental principle: in a real democracy, people not only have the right to question those in power, they have aresponsibilityto do so. We can rightfully say that every citizen has a right and a duty to ask questions of the rulers and the right to receive prompt and truthful answers.Unlike the many dictatorships and hollow/ fake democracies in our neighbourhood, our republic is a nation where we can civilly interrogate those in power, and that too without fear of reprisal.Right to askIt follows, therefore, that anyone who questions or undermines a citizen’s right to ask questions is anti-national. Anyone who derides people for asking questions is anti-national. Anyone who threatens a citizen for asking questions is anti-national. Anyone who misuses their official power to punish people asking questions is grossly and criminally anti-national and anti-Indian.Taking off from recent events, here are some questions people have been asking: Who is responsible for the horrendous security lapses that allowed an attack like Pulwama to take place? When will we see those responsible being removed from their positions?On what basis are government officials and ruling party leaders making claims about the effectiveness of the air-raid on Pakistan, especially when neutral international journalists are reporting that the raid was a complete fiasco?What actually happened on the day the IAF MiG-21 was shot down? The fact that the IAF lost the MiG and its pilot survived is clear, but is there any tangible evidence that a Pakistani F16 was also shot down? If not, why can’t we just accept that we lost a plane without any Pakistani aircraft being destroyed?These are all perfectly valid questions for any Indian to be asking. And anyone who says it’s unpatriotic to ask them, or that the questions are following a Pakistani script, or that doubting the Prime Minister or any other minister or the military is the same as ‘helping the enemy’, anyone who starts shouting and accusing the questioners of treachery is, truly and without doubt, an anti-national."
Let me say this — rape is banal: Germaine Greer,https://www.thehindu.com/society/let-me-say-this-rape-is-banal-germaine-greer/article26471292.ece,"
She is 80 and every bit as contentious as ever. The celebrated feminist, intellectual, polemicist lays it on the line
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"I was taken aback when she agreed. Everyone had said she was ‘difficult’. But Germaine Greer unfussily said yes to an interview. And there I was, walking a bit nervously towards her hotel room. It was a golden afternoon in Thiruvananthapuram, made more limpid by the Scotch Greer made me order through what she called the “impossible” intercom.Then we sat down to what in an old-fashioned world would be a ‘coze’. And that’s how Greer spoke, easily, laughingly, as if she’d known me a lifetime, launching into a long story about her recent fall (she had a walking stick), her distrust of doctors, her long links with India — “India, you break my heart!” — and how she lost her sense of smell (and taste) when she got whooping cough. On that note, we dismissed the cookies and set up the recorder. “Okay, let’s go!”Greer has written about being a liberation feminist and not an equality feminist, so I began with women fighting for entry to Sabarimala. “I will ask why,” she said instantly. “If it were a golf club, it would be fine. They could say we only allow women with red hair in. Why can’t we women start a club where the men are begging to be let in?” Greer disagreed with the court’s ruling. “I think the decision by the court, a secular authority, to ask a religious establishment to abide by their decision is profoundly wrong. India depends on a concept of freedom of religion.”Didn’t it make her angry that women were considered “impure” for a few days each month? “It’s nonsense!” she said. “Not even typical of Hinduism.” She described a tankha she’d seen (in an industrialist friend’s home) that had Kali dancing on Shiva — “the tankha was painted with menstrual blood,” she pointed out.Greer was more interested in “women’s power and the fear of that” — the male fear of invasions of bodily integrity; of menstruation (emergence of eggs or life) and pregnancy (carrying life inside). “We’re afraid of ambiguous states,” she said. “A woman issuing blood is at a boundary.”Get rid of menstruationHere, Greer became brisk. “We produce 13 eggs a year but we don’t even have one baby. How does that make sense? Surely someone can say: you don’t have to do this. You don’t have to keep producing seeds that won’t be planted, especially as there’s a health dividend.” She spoke of excess oestrogen and breast cancer, blood loss and anaemia. “I say, let’s stop menstruation. Let’s get rid of all this blood. We can’t afford it.”We moved to contraception, the Emergency, and India’s demographic transition. Greer said, “You will now ask, what about sex selection?” When I nodded, she continued, “I think if it’s your body, your pregnancy, it’s your decision.” If the woman says she needs a son because her in-laws will torment her, “I will not judge her.”Was she saying sex selection shouldn’t be penalised? “I don’t agree with prosecuting women. I need to hear her story. I need to treat her with respect. I need to help her.” Kerala had achieved demographic equity and Haryana might take longer, said Greer, but “it has to happen the right way. I trust women.”For Greer, courts are not necessarily the best tool for social reform. She sees society, religion, men and women changing organically from within. One way to effect that would be education, but wasn’t women’s education itself a source of social conflict? “It’s one of the causes of extreme violence. Men tell themselves that women have taken their jobs. Take Nirbhaya. She was educated, travelling at night, and those goondas, those idiots, wanted to punish her.”That brought us to rape and the views that have made her so unpopular lately. “What makes me angry,” Greer said, “is that everyone talks of the rape of Nirbhaya. That’s not the most important thing. She was murdered. That’s what you have to remember. She lay on the road, gutted.”How then does one deal with rape? Greer said, “I’ve been raped, I know what rape is. And let me say this: rape is banal. The penis wasn’t the worst of it. The worst was that he was hitting me and forcing me to say ‘f* me’. I was 19. I’m thinking, he can stand in court and say I said that. But I wasn’t consenting — he was bashing my head in! Now, I can’t even remember. I try to remember. Where was the steering wheel? Of course, the steering wheel wasn’t punching me, which is probably why I can’t remember it.”P for predatorSo we don’t criminalise rape? “No!” Greer exclaimed. “The history of rape as criminal offence is tied to the status of minority groups. Most people jailed for rape are members of minorities.” Greer, of course, has an offbeat solution, one she’s often spoken of. “What about a tattoo? P for predator; R for rapist...”Rape trials, for Greer, stumble because the accusation has to be proof; instead why not believe the woman and reduce punishment? She indignantly recounted the case of Ashraf Miah in the U.K., jailed for 13 years for attempted rape: “Of course, he frightened her! But she could’ve been frightened by a spider! You don’t imprison a spider!”Her trademark outrageous one-liners can be misleading outside context. #MeToo? “It’s a fashion.” Take back the night? “We’ve never had the night.” Sexual freedom? “Sex is a blood sport, you get hurt.” But a pattern emerges. Was she saying some of our expectations are unrealistic?“As a man walking at night, your chances of being kicked into the gutter and everything taken from you are very high. We imagine the world is safe for other people when it actually isn’t. If I go walking in my rainforest in Queensland, I have to tell someone where I am going. I could fall down, be bitten by a snake. I can’t just wander off. I might like to think that’s freedom but I’m afraid it’s stupidity.”Greer once said, “There’s no point in growing old unless you can be a witch.” At 80 now, was she a witch? “I wish I was a witch!” she exclaimed, with real wistfulness. “In my rainforest in Australia, there are many, many pythons. Because I live with them, I can walk amongst them, sit with them, and they’re not frightened away. That’s like being a witch. I love it.”We talked of pythons, of ageing, of limping, surviving. We watched an eagle circling over the treetops against a sun blazing downwards. Is that how she will go? In a blaze? “No!” she said. “No fuss! I hope I fall into a waste disposal unit.” I laughed at her odd wish, and she continued. “I am not afraid of death. I’ve had an amazing life and I’ve been very lucky. And that will have to do.”[email protected]"

Maula Jatt is to Pakistan what Sholay is to India, and this Eid a new remake is all set to release across the border
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Two vigilante revenge dramas, one set in rural Punjab and the other somewhere in the Hindi heartland, released within four years of each other. Both went on to blaze a long trail. Both made their way into the popular consciousness during a period of national emergency. And both, with their oft-quoted dialogues and consequential characters, spawned a succession of rip-offs, spin-offs and remakes. One remark here: the two —Sholay(1975) andMaula Jatt(1979) — despite their remarkably similar feudal background and shared elements, were conceived in the two conjoined nations on either side of the Radcliffe line. And now,The Legend of Maula Jatt, a big-budget remake directed by Bilal Lashari , is set to hit screens this Eid.The present spell of sabre-rattling between the two nuclear-armed neighbours only presents another ripe opportunity to reflect on the one factor that unites more than divides the arch-rivals: our common cultural past. And, given the failure of hard power to lead to any lasting solution, the cul-de-sac only strengthens the argument for both sides to make an uninterrupted — and uninterruptible — soft power push. This can, as scholar Alyssa Ayres has documented, begin with a re-discovery of ‘Punjabiyat’, as happened in the middle of the last decade, a few years after the 2001 Parliament attack.Maula Jattand its precursorWehshi Jatt(1975) act sometimes as the mirror image, sometimes the alter-ego ofSholay. Their eponymous, stentorian-toned lead character straddles the protagonist-antagonist binary, imbibing the traits of Thakur as well as Gabbar Singh. His nemesis in the second film, Noori Nutt, is a conniving, masochistic version of Gabbar. The background score accompanying Noori is surely a throwback to Gabbar.Humanising the beastThe two Sultan Rahi-starrers have their roots in progressive writer Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi’s short storyGandasa, a study of the psychological transformation of the lead character from a weapon-totingwehshi(beast) — one whose moniker and machete (gandasa) strike terror in the hearts of children — to a considerate mortal. However, the films change the thrust of Qasmi’s story by externalising, rather than internalising, Maula’s existential angst. Writer Nasir Adeeb is not interested in the character’s animus coming in touch with his anima, which happens in Qasmi’sGandasathrough the introduction of Rajo, a woman from his enemy Ranga’s family.Poster of Wehshi Jatt (1975)Instead, Adeeb, in both films, focuses on giving full play to the rivalries of the feuding clans. It is a mediaeval set-up, albeit one with modern elements like the existence of a dysfunctional law-and-order machinery, where caste loyalties trump those of nation.In the first film, the lead vows not just to destroy the family of Ranga, who has murdered his father, but his entire Malik tribe. In the second film, Maula also acts as a jurist, administering kangaroo justice — when he is not sparring with his bête noire Noori Nutt, that is.Manly men and the deep stateAs documented by historian Iqbal Sevea, Maula’s character was the archetype of the ideal Punjabi onscreen male — fierce, masculine and steeped in notions of pride and honour. Maula’s ascent, he says, represented the backlash of the Punjabi-speaking Jatt proletariat against the domination of the Urdu-speaking elite, whose patois and paraphernalia were ascendant till the 70s in Pakistani films.The masculinity of Maula and Noori, and their desire to prove it at every step, can be also seen as representative of the bigger crisis of identity faced by the Pakistani state. Though the characters’ pursuit of extra-constitutional violence was in parallel to the state machinery, their perpetual proclivity to assert their power and create adversaries was reflective of the heavily militarised apparatus of Pakistan’s deep state, a behemoth whose existence is predicated on the country’s perceived enmity with its neighbour. Noori’s amputation at the end, which signifies the end of the two warlords’ race to the bottom, can be seen as a marker of Pakistan’s partition in 1971. Pakistan’s identity crisis only became more acute during the aggressive Islamisation of Zia-ul-Haq’s regime, when the long arm of the state was used to suppress dissent and keep women in a state of subservience.UnlikeSholay, where the caste equations between Gabbar and Thakur are kept muted, caste identity is front and centre inMaula Jatt. The battle between Maula and Noori is not just a battle of two families, it is a Gramscian War of Position, at the end of which the dominant Jatt identity emerges triumphant, and through it, a notion of the ideal Punjabi male is congealed.Historian John Tosh argues that masculinity has both a psychic and a social dimension. In the case of Maula, the psychic dimension reflects in his status as the ‘protector’ of the honour of the village, including its women, while the social is seen in the implicit ‘gandasa’ code through which the villagers act in his presence.Rebel phenomenonThe Punjabi film industry in Pakistan expanded massively in the 80s followingMaula Jatt’s success; more than 8,000 Pakistani Punjabi films have been made till date, more than four times the number of Indian Punjabi movies. In contrast, the equivalent industry in India struggled until the mid 2000s. This difference is partly due toLahore, one of the film capitals of pre-Partition India, being intheirPunjab. However, a second factor here is that while the best Punjabi talent migrated en masse to Bombay, thecrème de la crèmeof expertisethereremained in Punjab. Hence, while more than 8,000 Pakistani Punjabi films have been made thus far, the output on the Indian side is just one-fourth of that number.Maula Jattwent on to develop cult status, which can also be understood through a reading of the numerous academic texts on it.Cinema and Society, an anthology on Pakistani cinema, says the film became a signifier of “rebellious masculinity” for Punjab’s men. Its dialogues became a staple of conversations and speeches. Sindh leader Altaf Hussain’s mimicking of Sultan Rahi while attacking the Punjabi political elite is one example. Incidentally, Hussain belongs to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a party that represents mohajirs — those who migrated from India during Partition. His appropriation of a Punjabi masculine symbol cannot but be seen as a rebellion against the dominance of the Punjabi upper-caste elite in politics, giving the film’s allegorical aspect a new dimension.“Maula Jatt… didn’t start off as a phenomenon, but simmered and then exploded,” says Ali Khan, co-editor ofCinema and Society. “[One] reason it became so popular was that General Zia [ul-Haq] sought to ban the film because it had what he felt were elements of rebellion in it… Nasir Adeeb [the writer] stated that audiences cheered whenever a policeman was beaten in the film or when authority was challenged...” Khan adds that “whenever [Maula Jatt] gets a small showing, you will find audiences flocking to the theatre, many of whom know every dialogue and repeat it as the film proceeds. People feel an affinity for it.”Still from The Legend of Maula Jatt (2019)Masculinity, vitality, vigour. These are the words that pop out of the screen when you seeThe Legend of Maula Jatt’s trailer. Starring Fawad Khan — known for his romantic roles — as Maula, the film promises to make the Maula-Noori contest not just adversarial, but gladiatorial. Will it achieveMaula Jatt’s cult status? Or will it be crucified, as many wannabeSholays were? Will it be a harbinger of better times for the Punjabi film industry in Pakistan, currently experiencing recession? Or will it trigger an increase in quantity but regression in quality, as the originalMaula Jattdid? These are some of the questions being asked ahead of the film’s wide-scale release across the border."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chairperson Swati Maliwal on Thursday said that the commission will launch a women’s manifesto prior to the elections to ensure women’s issues are brought to the fore.“During the ongoing Mahila Suraksha Padyatra, we realised that issues concerning women are not electoral issues during the polls. The DCW will create a ‘women’s manifesto’and I will meet leaders of all political parties and ask them to adopt the same,” said Ms. Maliwal.She also said that the Delhi government should adopt “proper policies” to ensure rehabilitation of survivors of trafficking, acid attack victims and others. Over the last 12 days, the women’s commission conducted a march across the Capital to generate awareness about safety of women and girls.“The most common complaint was regarding domestic violence, sale of illicit liquor, lack of employment and widow pensions. Women also complained about the fact that elected members of their respective areas hardly visit them to listen to their concerns,” she said. Additionally, Ms. Maliwal said, a report on shelter homes across the national capital was under progress and will be submitted to the Delhi government soon."

",,"Three Indonesian soldiers were killed after a clash with dozens of rebels in the eastern province of Papua, the military said late on Thursday, the latest deaths amid high tensions and violence in the restive region.Papua, a former Dutch colony and the western part of New Guinea island, was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticised U.N.-backed referendum in 1969.A long-running separatist movement in the region has seen an increase in violence in recent months.A team of 25 soldiers was ambushed by up to 70 “armed criminals” carrying military-standard weapons and traditional weapons, the Indonesian army said in a statement.“The team fought back until they were able to drive the armed criminal group back into the forest. Three soldiers died in the attack,” said the statement. Up to 10 rebels were thought to have been killed, but only one of their bodies was found.Two military helicopters dispatched to evacuate the soldiers also came under fire, the army said.Indonesia recently deployed hundreds of soldiers to build a major highway connecting the remotest parts of the resource-rich province, after 16 construction workers were killed by separatists late last year.Since then, fighting between rebels and the Indonesian military has caused hundreds of villagers to flee the Nduga area in western New Guinea island.President Joko Widodo, who faces an election in April, has vowed to finish the highway project as part of his promise to develop Papua, Indonesia's poorest region."

Further research led him to the infamous Russian sleep experiment, and that’s howSubject UH1317, Light and Blind productions’ second play, came into being.“Two doctors, three subjects in a sealed chamber and one drug-induced paranoia”, reads the one-line synopsis of this psychological thriller which traces the journey of three subjects of a government-funded experiment.“It is definitely not for the faint-hearted,” laughs Hari as he goes on to describe the sleepless nights of research that led to this play, written by Shruti Parasuraman.Music plays an important role in the production, says the director. “Though it is digitalised, the mild background music contributes to the setting of the play,” he continues. Stunts and violence too play integral roles. The script weaves in a fictional story into the concept of pushing human beings to the extreme. “In the name of Science, experiments like these escape the ‘war crime’ tag, which is dangerous.

Baapu”, a sensitive play directed by Bhanu Bharti, captures Mahatma Gandhi’s principled opposition to the proposal of the Partition of the country
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Bharatendu Natya Utsav, organised annually by Sahitya Kala Parishad, Government of Delhi, has acquired a significant place in the theatre world of the Capital in which the best productions of the year are featured. This year’s Utsav opened with the specially invited production of “Baapu” which was staged by Aaj Rangmandal at the Kamani Auditorium as a part of the celebration of the 150 birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.Written by renowned Hindi playwright Prof. Nand Kishore Acharya, recipient of Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Baapu unfolds like a long lyrical poem evoking intensely melancholic mood, replete with tragic musings. It reveals multiple layers of the wounded soul of Mahatma Gandhi towards the close of his life who is bitter by the betrayal of his followers in his quest for the creation of a spiritually powerful Indian society, strong enough to be the true practitioners of Satya and Ahimsa. The focal point of the play is the troubled inner world of Gandhi and out of which emerges the dichotomy between the great ideals of non-violence once followed by his followers with sincerity and their present opportunism for the lust after political power. The synthesis of expressive theatrical elements into artistic whole stirs the soul of the audience.Nehruvian philosophyThe directorThe play is directed by Bhanu Bharti, one of the pioneers of contemporary Indian theatre, who has several landmark productions of different genres to his credit . His philosophical vision is influenced by the Nehruvian era and his artistic credo is inspired by Gavari, a community theatre form of Bhils of Udaipur, Rajasthan and the Japanese classical theatre Noh and Kabuki.Over the years, he has evolved his own form to reflect deep antagonism in contemporary Indian society. In the production, what one discerns is his insight into what lies beneath the surface and to interpret the historical context in which Gandhi stands alone while the country is passing through turmoil and witnessing communal carnage. He undertakes fast for communal harmony and for ensuring safety for Muslims.Recalling BoseSolo in structure, the play is replete with historical references. In the play, the character of Gandhi refers again and again to Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose, the Muslim League and Mountbatten. The core of the production is Gandhi's principled opposition to the proposal of the Partition of the country. He is vehemently opposed to the proposals of the Cabinet Mission. He is sad that Nehru, Patel and Azad are following the plan of the Partition conceived on the basis of communalism. He feels that the top Congress leadership is close to Mountbatten while keeping him in the dark about the Partition. At several places, he declares that the country will only be divided on his dead body. He believes that the Congress leadership should be handed over to the younger generation and suggests the name of Narendra Dev but to his utter dismay his proposal is rejected outright.At the hour of his utter alienation, he recalls Subhas Chandra Bose whose candidature for the Congress President he had opposed tooth and nail. He says Subhas's men of Azad Hind Fauj came to his help to bring about peace and stop communal carnage. He recalls with pain that those whom he once considered his followers in the quest for truth and non-violence have done little to stop communal riots and instead they move out in police protection. Had they been Satyagarhi, they would have died in the cause of communal harmony and non-violence. He realises that his firm belief in non-violence, truth and call for communal harmony will enrage a section of Hindus and is obsessed with fanaticism as they are. They will kill him and this will be the death of a Satyagarhi who embraces death for the cause of Ahimsa and Satya.The play opens in a room with scanty objects-a bed, a small stool, a candle and at some distance a chair and charkha are kept. The emptiness of the space indicates solitude in which the protagonist has confined himself. Gandhi is alone, talking to himself. In the second half there is no bed, Gandhi sits on the floor. His alienation from the top leadership of the Congress has acquired an ominous air. Towards the end, we hear three gun shots and ‘Hey Ram’. The lights fade out.Realistic styleLighting by seasoned lighting designer R.K. Dhingra is highly ingenious. To create the right ambience, he has mostly used mood lighting and haze machine. Through lighting design, a black curtain is projected upstage, displaying a window on the wall. Only the movements of the performer are provided with a light that makes them clearly visible and most of the space is dimly lighted to reinforce the gloomy mood to reflect the isolation of a life inspired by great ideals.Teekam Joshi, a graduate from National School of Drama and one of the outstanding stage actors, is superbly cast in the role of Gandhi. He acts in a realistic style with restraint, imparting tremendous emotional tension to the portrait, revealing the inner turmoil of his character and truly living his life – indeed a memorable performance."

Faces legal battle on film’s screening rights in SAARC countries
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In November last year, in its content showcase “See What’s Next: Asia” summit in Singapore, Netflix had announced eight new original films for the India market. Among them wasHotel Mumbai, a fictionalised account of the 2008 terrorist attacks on India’s financial capital, specifically the siege of Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotels.Netflix had claimed to have acquired the streaming rights for South and South East Asian territories for the American-Australian production, directed by Anthony Maras, starring Dev Patel, Anupam Kher, Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi in key roles. At the time, Netflix had also said that it planned to screen the film in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries that include India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.The film is now off the Netflix menu in these regions.With things on a boil in the sub-continent, the immediate question on most media watchers’ minds was whether the move had anything to do with the current state of Indo-Pak relations. Industry sources clarified that it had nothing to do with the diplomatic heat but a litigation that the streaming giant is embroiled in. While no official statement has come from Netflix, owing to the case being sub judice, the source said that “Netflix has terminated its agreement with the licenser of the film”. It will not distribute and release the film in India and the other regions.According to media reports, a Dubai-based firm, Plus Holdings, has moved the Bombay High Court, filing a petition to seek injunction against Netflix from screeningHotel Mumbai. The firm claimed that it had been granted broadcasting rights for the movie in SAARC nations.The rights were given for all digital and non-digital platforms (theatrical, satellite, digital, etc). The firm has alleged that the deal was illegally cancelled for the rights to be licensed instead to the streaming giant.The film releases in Australia on March 15 and in the U.S. on March 29.The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September last year and elicited a varied response — from wide appreciation for its portrayal of both the beastly as well as the humane side of the terrorists to criticism for its refusal to point a finger at the nationality of the perpetrators of violence and for not zooming in more acutely on the State ineptness in handling the situation; from the audience being overwhelmed by the moving recreation of the harrowing hours to their discomfort with its “disaster drama”, “thriller mode” and “entertainment value”."

Telling him while it’s easier to shoot and kill than to develop a nation, prosperity can only happen in peace.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Friday met a Filipino Muslim rebel leader who has become a regional governor under a Malaysian-brokered peace deal, telling him while it’s easier to shoot and kill than to develop a nation, prosperity can only happen in the absence of war.Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebel chairman Murad Ebrahim said Mr. Mahathir pledged during their meeting in Manila that his country will help ensure the success of the peace accord that transformed him and other rebel commanders last month into administrators of a conflict-wracked Muslim autonomous region in the south.Mr. Mahathir met Mr. Murad on the last day of his visit to Manila, where he held talks with President Rodrigo Duterte on a wide range of issues, including combatting Islamic State-linked militants in the largely Roman Catholic nation’s southern region of Mindanao.“Prime Minister Mahathir told him it’s easy to shoot and kill, but it’s difficult to develop. Chairman Murad said ‘Yes, that is the next level of our struggle, how to develop and transform our revolutionary organization,’” said Nabil Tan, a Philippine official who joined the meeting.Mr. Murad said Mr. Mahathir told him, “If there is peace, then everything will come ... He really encouraged us.”“I explained to him our priorities, the challenges. Part of the challenges is our transformation from revolutionaries to this governance. We want to have programs that will benefit the people,” Mr. Murad told .Under the peace deal brokered by Malaysia, Mr. Murad’s group gave up its goal of a separate Muslim state in exchange for broader autonomy. The 40,000 fighters and at least 7,000 firearms that Murad’s group has declared are to be demobilized starting this year in three phases depending on progress in the agreement’s enforcement.The first huge batch of about 12,000 guerrillas and their firearms would be demobilized in two to three months, Mr. Murad said.Murad’s people, including fierce Muslim commanders still facing criminal cases for past attacks, were sworn in last month to comprise 41 of 80 regional administrators, who would lead a transition government for the five-province region called Bangsamoro until regular leaders are elected in 2022.Mr. Duterte picked his representatives, along with Muslim rebels from another group, to fill the rest of the transition authority, which will also act as a regional parliament.The Philippine and Western governments see effective Muslim autonomy as an antidote to nearly half a century of Muslim secessionist violence, which the Islamic State group could exploit to gain a foothold in the region.Bangsamoro replaces an existing poverty-wracked autonomous region of more than 3.7 million people with a larger, better-funded and more powerful entity. An annual grant, which could reach more than $1 billion, is to be set aside to bolster development in a region that has little infrastructure and is deeply scarred by decades of fighting.Smaller but more violent groups aligned with the Islamic State group like the Abu Sayyaf still threaten the region.During talks with Mr. Mahathir on Thursday, Mr. Duterte thanked Malaysia for brokering the peace talks. The Malaysian leader pledged to continue helping.A Malaysia-led team of 28 international peace monitors will remain in the south until all Muslim guerrillas have demobilized under the peace deal, Malaysian officials said. The European Union, Japan and Brunei have contributed personnel to the peacekeeping contingent, which has been credited for enforcing a years-long ceasefire and helping ease major fighting in the past."

Through conversations, Uber drivers sensitised to actions that can be viewed as sexual harassment ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Don’t adjust the rear view mirror constantly, don’t place your phone on your lap, refrain from having personal conversation with riders, and ensure that lewd songs don’t play while driving women customers. These were some of the tips that Uber drivers took away from an interactive gender sensitisation programme conducted on Wednesday.Drivers were drawn into conversations about why they felt sexual assaults and harassment were taking place in the city and the country. ‘Short clothes’, ‘internet’, ‘lack of culture’, and ‘overall mindset’ were listed out by drivers as being the reasons.A trainer from Manas Foundation, countered their claims, and also stressed on all the actions that can be viewed as sexual harassment, which includes looking at a woman. At the very start of the meeting, the trainer said the session was not to find fault with drivers, but to enlist them in the fight against violence and discrimination.The session included a few short games and skits which enacted a scenario between a driver and woman customer to highlight how usual practices such as adjusting mirrors could make women uncomfortable and feel unsafe.Monica Kumar, managing trustee and clinical psychologist of the foundation, said this type of engagement allows drivers to understand the absence of gender justice for women, especially with regards to mobility. “It is this understanding that has been crucial to the change in attitude, and treatment of women – both in terms of women commuters and women in their own families,” she said.Manas Foundation had conducted a training programme for 6,000 Uber drivers across India as a trial in 2018. The current drive is to scale up the same initiative.The training session will be held every day till July and company officials said it is voluntary for drivers. The first session was held on Tuesday.“There’ s nothing more important than the safety of the people we serve. Gender-based violence is an issue that affects all communities, including the Uber community, and we are committed to being part of the solution,” Krishna Veer Singh, head of trust and safety at Uber, India and South Asia, said."

There is a “conspiracy”, Ms. Banerjee notes, to “erase the very memory of Mahatma Gandhi, especially his work towards the making of a secular India.She also panned the BJP government for using Sardar Patel’s statue as ploy to gain publicity. “All of a sudden, BJP spent thousands of crores of rupees to erect his statue. What is surprising is how constructing such a huge statue of Gandhiji was not considered; how building statues of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose or Babasaheb Ambedkar or Rabindranath Tagore was not thought of,” she wrote.On the Opposition, she notes that it is essential that “based on the common minimum programme, all those who are powerful should rise against these tyrants, wherever they hold their power.”She also reiterated her recent questions on Pulwama.

An organisation on a mission to address the grievances of the aggrieved
",,"The formal government set-up to deal with women’s issues can not address the grievances of those, also women, who are part of the system.There are a number of women Human Rights Defenders (HRD) such as ANM, ASHA worker, anganwadi teacher and SHG members at the village level, who still hesitate to raise their voice due to threat, insecurity, community boycott and personal attack on life, as is faced by whistle-blowers across the globe. Moreover, the women stakeholders are so engrossed in their work that they discharge duties in their own respective spheres, losing the much-needed synergy in taking a comprehensive look.

In conversation with the Chief Minister who just completed 1,000 days in office
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Pinarayi Vijayan, the Chief Minister of Kerala, just completed 1,000 days in office. During this time, his government faced some unprecedented challenges such as the floods in 2018 and the implementation of the Supreme Court order to allow young women to visit the Sabarimala temple. In this interview, Mr. Vijayan speaks of those challenges and his government’s development agenda.Excerpts:Kerala has witnessed one of the worst floods in its history in 2018. What’s the present status of rebuilding activities? How long it will take to complete the rebuilding process?The reconstruction bid is really a mammoth and unparalleled task. It will take two-three years to complete the task. During the floods, we gave priority for rescue operations and relief activities. We were able to rescue more than 1,63,000 people from August 17 to 20. Around 1.5 million were shifted to around 4,000 relief shelters across Kerala. The State government has provided, for 700,000 families, ₹10000 rupees each as immediate financial assistance.Today, we are mainly focusing on the reconstruction of damaged houses and roads. A total of 13,362 houses were fully damaged in the floods. The first installment of financial assistance has been distributed for the reconstruction of 9,341 houses. The cooperative sector will rebuild 2,000 houses. The government has identified and sought support of sponsors for the construction of rest of the houses.A total of 1,075 landless families have lost their houses in the flood. We have identified suitable land for them. In the flood 2,42,602 houses were partially damaged. Among these, 1,21,265 beneficiaries have got the first financial installment... I am hopeful that we will complete this process before the end of this financial year.Did Kerala get necessary help from the Union government for the post-flood rebuilding?The actual loss incurred by the State in the flood amounts to ₹31,000 crore. This is equal to the total amount of the annual plan of the State. But according to the criteria of the Union government, we are eligible to ask for just ₹5,000 crore. Even this amount is not allocated for us. It also remains that we are not allowed to accept the volunteer help offered by the foreign countries. Our Ministers are denied permission by the Union government from visiting non-resident Malayalees to raise fund for reconstruction. The State government also hasn’t got any written permission from the centre to raise our borrowing capacity.The implementation of GST and other policies have really curbed the financial autonomy of State governments. The situation also doesn’t not exist to raise our own tax revenue. Today, we need a real rethinking of central-State economic relations in the direction of assuring enough resource allocation and economic assistance for the States. It is only then that our federal structure would work in a manner suiting the interests of both the Central and State governments.How do you look at the whole Sabarimala agitation? There were allegations that the government failed to consider the sentiments of the devotees while implementing the Supreme Court order...From the beginning itself the government’s position is that it would uphold the principles of the Constitution and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The State has submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court, stating that whatever may be the court verdict, the government would abide by that and would implement it. So it is the fundamental responsibility of the State government to implement the verdict. Look at the initial response when the verdict came; everybody including the AICC [All India Congress Committee], the Opposition leader [in Kerala], BJP State president and the RSS have all accepted it. Some people even called it a historical judgment. They also said, even before me, that the government has legal obligation to implement it.Unfortunately, after this, the same people started openly challenging our Constitution. Their ultimate aim was to disturb and malign Kerala’s secular mind and orchestrate a religious riot. Even those who claim themselves as the champions of secularism fell in that trap. But the people of Kerala realised these things and stood firm in the spirit of secularism. People at large kept themselves restrained and resisted the efforts to orchestrate religious riot in the state.A large number of devotees don’t favour the entry of women in the menstruation age into Sabarimala. Do you think your government has succeeded in communicating your position on this issue with the larger section of society?Different Left governments holding office before the High Court verdict of 1991 never tried to prevent the entry of menstruating women into Sabarimala. In the same way, Left governments never acted in opposition against the High Court verdict of 1991, which restricted the women entry. The most important thing to remember is that the Communist party was never part of the legal discourse on this issue. It was actually the devotees themselves who approached the honourable judiciary to either ban the women entry or lift the restriction. After the Supreme Court verdict, we have consistently said that it is not the job of our party or the state government to ‘recruit’ women to Sabarimala.On the other hand, we have taken a clear stand that it is the duty of the State government to give necessary protection for anybody who visit Sabarimala based on the Supreme Court verdict and their individual faith. We have seen massive participation of general public, including women, in the LDF’s political meetings on the Sabarimala issue. We have also seen huge participation of women belonging to different faiths in the “women’s wall” for gender justice. All of this shows that we have been successful in communicating our stand with the common people.How effective was your government’s response in maintaining law and order in the wake of protests and frequent hartals over the Sabarimala issue?The government has taken strict action against the perpetrators of violence across the State. Protest has even reached to the level of throwing bomb at a police station. Media persons were also brutally attacked. Most of the culprits arrested in these cases are Sangh Parivar activists. The most bizarre thing that we see today is that the same Sangh Parivar organisations campaigning that devotees should not do any offering to temples including Sabarimala are on a fund collection drive to deal with their cases. In Kerala, they tried to use the same technique they practice in other parts of the country.This is the technique of orchestrating religious enmity and riot in order to garner political gains. But Ayappa devotees themselves and the people of Kerala at large have realised their motive now. We should not forget the fact that the same time when these forces were engaged in violence in the name of Sabarimala, the pilgrimage was going on smoothly.The BJP leadership has officially conceded and confirmed that they are winding up their protest due to lack of enough support. It means that they failed to achieve what they aimed at. This defeat of Sangh Parivar is a result of the collective resistance shown by the people of Kerala.What is your take on the argument that the restriction on women’s entry in the Sabarimala temple is part of religious custom? How do you view the Supreme Court judgment?The renaissance movement and social reformers have taught us that superstitious beliefs and customs should be challenged and opposed. Modern Kerala is a product of the selfless social service of great visionaries. The nation’s Constitution is supreme and above all, the customs and beliefs. In the verdict, the Supreme Court has clearly spelled out that any violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution can’t be allowed. All governments, come into power based on the constitutional principles, are obliged to uphold the constitution as supreme.The Left government is into its third year. How do you assess the government's performance?We have actually announced a 35-point programme and succeeded in completing most of them in time. The basic emphasis was on the development of infrastructure. The GAIL pipeline project, the LNG terminal, Kochi Metro, Water Metro, National water way, Kannur International Airport, Vizhinjam port, Hill Highway and coastal highway projects are some of the major projects we have concentrated on.Four flagship missions (Ardram, Life, Haritha Keralam, Public education protection drive) launched by this government are implementing with success. As part of this, we can see a major jump in educational and health sectors. Before we complete our term in office we will provide home for every family in Kerala. No one will remain homeless.Our effort is to create enough jobs in our State itself for the qualified and educated youth. In order to achieve this goal, we are utilising the opportunities in the IT filed. The government is also taking measures to create new jobs by strengthening the public sector and the traditional sector. The amount of social welfare pensions increased as highest rate in the country level .This could be emulated by other States also.In a historic move we have appointed, for the first time, Dalits and other backward caste people as priests in the Devaswom Board-owned temples. I would like to add that the Kerala government has done more than any government could do in 1,000 days. In the coming days our main focus will be on post-flood rebuilding and also on production and industrial sector.The Left generally talks about and aim at an alternative development path. As Kerala is the only Left ruling State now, could you talk about the alternative policies you could introduce?When the central government tries to disinvest the public sector enterprises, we try to empower them. We have been successful in making the public sector enterprises under Kerala government profitable within one year after coming into power. Along with this, we are taking over public enterprises which are disinvested by the Central government in Kerala. When the Central government try to privatise the education sector, the schools in Kerala have been upgraded as the best in the country.When the central government withdraw from the social sector, the Kerala government actively intervened in social welfare measures and also provide social welfare pension at the highest rate in the country.Newspapers report that the number of jobs created has decreased in the country after [Narendra] Modi came to power. But in Kerala, our government gave appointment to 1 lakh youngsters through the public service commission. We also created 20,000 new posts in the same period.Our government has also succeeded in increasing wage and other benefits in more than 80% of the labour sector. We could also implement a Bill giving employees the right to sit and work, intervened in raising the salary of nurses and also intervened in the plantation sector. The four missions that we have set up basically aim to bring structural changes with an alternative development outlook.On January 1, Kerala saw a 627-km long Women’s Wall. What was the reason behind the government’s decision to have such an event?It was not actually the government’s decision to organise the women wall. Instead, the idea emerged in a meeting of different community and progressive organisations convened by the State government. Immediately after the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala, there was a dangerous and regressive effort, in the name of custom and belief, to tarnish the progressive achievements of Kerala. Against the court verdict of upholding gender equality, there were efforts to bring in public women and claim themselves as impure. Gender and caste-based defamation reached into the level of violent attacks.There took place incidences of attack, in public, against women. These events necessitated organised resistance against these forces. It was in this context that the State government initiated a meeting of progressive organisations. In this meeting, representatives of 170 organisations participated and the idea of women wall emerged. The basic objectives of women wall were the slogans of protecting renaissance values, ensuring gender equality, not allowing Kerala to become a lunatic asylum. Kerala wholeheartedly welcomed this initiative and around 5.5 million women joined in the wall from Kasaragode to Thiruvananthapuram.The CPI(M) is in favour of reservation for economically backward classes among the forward castes. The other argument is that economic reservation is against the spirit of our Constitution. What’s your take?Reservation is necessary in the Indian context in order to empower the historically marginalised castes. At the same time, there are thousands in the general category too who face economic difficulties. Reservation for the socially backward castes should be continued as such. But relief should be provided for economically backward sections of the upper castes.The Supreme Court has maintained that reservation should not cross the 50% mark. We can’t accept any move from any quarter that would reverse the constitutionally guaranteed reservation. Such efforts would result in enmity between different communities or even result in clashes between communities.Introducing reservation for economically weaker sections of the general category should not affect the existing reservation. In the appointments to the posts under Travancore Devaswom Board, we have ensured that it would not affect reservation of the existing communities or violate the 50% cap.Aggressive right-wing nationalism registers significant growth in different parts of the world. In India too we see such an upsurge or emboldening of such forces. How the organised Left would resist this?The Kerala society maintains a unique secular mindset. This secular social formation is a result of numerous struggles led by the communist movements and other progressive forces. Because of this historical legacy, Kerala still keeps away these right wing forces. Discredited with having no popular support in society, they try to show their might and influence people through their muscle power. We have seen violence and aggression in the Sabarimala protests. But unlike other States, the Hindu rightwing forces were not able to gain much influence in Kerala due to the strong resistance offered by the Left.In a pan-Indian context, the communist movements and the Left pursue many folded battles against neo-liberalism and communalism. It is because of this strong stand on these two fronts that we are continuously targeted and attacked by the ruling classes in different parts of the country. In West Bengal and Tripura, you could see it in open eye. Recently, CPI(M) leader Brinda Sahni who was in the frontline of land struggles in Bihar was brutally killed by those who protect the interests of the landlord classes. All this shows that we pose a real political challenge to the communal forces in the country.You talked about creating employment opportunities? Has your government succeeded in creating enough jobs for the State’s youth?The principle aim and policy of this government is to create enough employment opportunities for the educated in Kerala itself. It is in tune with this aim that our government involves in IT and other sectors. As part of this, around 2,000 new start-ups have begun operation after this government came to power. We have a policy of using science and technology for social progress and human welfare. The prospects of health, tourism, etc. in job creation is also being explored.We are making a new jump in the production of electrical vehicles. Materialisation of the Virology Institute and Life Science Park opens up new possibilities based on knowledge. Making profitable the public enterprises and reviving the traditional industrial sectors have increased job opportunities in the State. We have also got a strong cooperative sector. The possibilities of increasing the productivity of agriculture and fisheries sector also offer opportunities for the State.The agriculture sector was one of the main areas to focus on post-flood rebuilding. How do you deal with the challenges agriculture faces?Our objective is to attain self sufficiency in agriculture. We have launched Harita Keralam mission as part of this. We were moving into self-sufficiency in the field of milk, vegetable and egg production. Unfortunately, the havoc caused by the flood stalled our efforts in this direction. Heavy rainfall and flood caused structural changes in the soil character. So we need detailed a study of these issues before beginning cultivation. We have launched an action plan to protect the biodiversity. Flood level is also digitally marked.On the basis of this, we could start production activities suitable for our environment. Along with the objective of increasing agricultural production, we also aim to increase the scope for agricultural related business activities in the State. We have great scope for value addition and processing of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish etc. This will ensure more income for the farmer.It is the wrong trade policies of the central government which cause for price collapse and international competition. Removing import restrictions on rubber caused for huge slash in its price for domestic farmers. The Union government didn’t take any action in the direction of creating price stability fund for rubber. But in our State, we have created such a fund worth of ₹500 crore. The fall in pepper price is also a result of such wrong policies pursued by the Central government.The Lok Sabha election is on the door step. How do you analyse the political situation? What is your party’s main agenda in this election?We have a situation in the country where the BJP and the RSS try to crumble the basic edifice of our country. The assault on constitutional bodies and autonomous institutions is unprecedented. We have a situation where four senior judges of the Supreme Court came out against interventions in the functioning of the apex court.We also know what is happening with the CBI. It is a serious matter that an autonomous body like the Central Vigilance Commission played a part in the Central government’s intervention in matters of the CBI. In higher education institutions and research institutes, people without enough qualification and people with complete obedience to the ruling establishment are appointed.Myths are being presented as science and facts become causality. Even the right to privacy of the individuals is breached. So in this context, the coming election assumes much significance in protecting the basic idea of India.The current government is one of the most anti-people governments in the history of this country. Minorities, Dalits, peasants, students, writers, working class have suffered the worst consequences of the Modi government. They have turned into active protest against this government. The general sentiment in the country is now against the BJP and the RSS. Recent assembly elections and bye-elections in different States show that. The same will be reflected in the coming election too.As far as the CPI(M) is concerned, our primary aim is to defeat the BJP. Both the BJP and the Congress are equally enthusiastic about implementing neoliberal policies in the country. If you look in this way, then we could understand that two parties are both sides of the same coin. Both these parties also use communal sentiments in different ways and degrees. The BJP pursues communal politics more aggressively and also, as they are led by the RSS, there is great danger of fascism involved in their politics. Because of this, our primary aim is to defeat the BJP. For which we will adopt political tactics according to the prevailing political situation in each State.For the Left, politics is a way of conducting ideological struggles. We could build a better world only through such struggles. Our political activities have been oriented towards this objective. It is the communist parties and Left movements which have led the struggles of peasants, workers and students in the last years.These struggles have really influenced in shaping popular mood against the RSS and the BJP. We have also registered electoral success in places where we are able to widen and consolidate our support base through these struggles. So we are very confident about the future.Don’t you think that the coming general election will also be a test of your government in Kerala?The Lok Sabha election is an opportunity to evaluate the Union government and also the national politics. I have already explained what the State government has done for the people of Kerala. The people have realised from their experience the difference between present Kerala and what was the situation two and a half years ago.In the same period, we have also actively involved in checking regressive efforts aimed at backtracking the achievements of the State. Along with maintaining the progressive nature of society, we have also succeeded in maintaining people’s unity. So the people of Kerala know well about which political force is leading Kerala towards progress. Because of this, we are confident and hopeful about the election result.Jipson John and Jitheesh P.M are fellows at Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research"

From stone-pelters in Kashmir to Maoists in AOB, Kanchan Yadav has seen it all
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Serving as Assistant Commandant of the 198 CRPF Battalion in Visakhapatnam district is Kanchan Yadav, a gritty police officer who epitomises the fact that no job can be out of reach for a woman. The CRPF officer has seen her share of violence — she was posted in Srinagar from 2014 to 2017 at a time when the Valley was engulfed in a wave of stone-pelting and unrest.It was during this time that Ms. Yadav began to be referred to as ‘Lady Singham’ by her male peers, a sobriquet that she modestly shrugs off.Unrest in ValleyMs. Yadav was the lone woman officer who was part of the operations to take on stone-pelting mobs in Downtown Srinagar in Kashmir Valley. ""Earlier, the stone-pelting used to be done by the mobs only on Fridays or Sundays, but after the Burhan Wani encounter, it became an everyday affair. Each day was a challenge for me and my company,"" Ms. Yadav says.Was she ever afraid? ""I was never overcome by fear as my brothers in arms were always by my side. When it comes to operations, there is no hierarchy, and we work together for the safety and security of our people and the nation,"" Ms. Yadav says.Stellar careerAfter completing her B.Sc in zoology from Delhi University, Ms. Yadav wrote the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) examination and qualified on her first attempt in 2010.Thereafter, she was sent for basic training in 2012 and was inducted into the 44th Battalion in January 2014.It was baptism by fire, as her first posting was in downtown Srinagar. She was given a choice to work at Battalion Headquarters, but she preferred to be with her company in the conflict zone.It runs in the familyFor Ms. Yadav, a career in the CRPF was what she was destined for, as she had made up her mind as a child.""I come from a family that has donned the uniform. My grandfather was with the CRPF and my father with the Indian Air Force. My mother is still a serving officer in the CRPF. I was inspired by her,"" says Ms. Yadav.On why she preferred to join the CRPF, Ms. Yadav says, ""The scope of other forces such as Border Security Force (BSF) or Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) is limited. CRPF is deployed across the country. Working for the CRPF gives me the unique opportunity to serve in different locations, different conflict theatres and throws up different challenges.

‘Women in ancient India breached the glass ceiling’,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/women-in-ancient-india-breached-the-glass-ceiling/article26450883.ece,"
Texts like Arthashastra acknowledge women’s political agency, says Ashoka University professor
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Ancient Indian texts and inscriptions reveal the complexities of the relationship of women in political power and violence, Dr. Upinder Singh, professor of History at Ashoka University, Sonepat, said here. However, normative texts such as theArthashastraacknowledge women’s political agency, and the history of ancient India offers several examples of women who exercised power directly or indirectly, she said.Speaking at a lecture on Women, Power and Violence: Perspectives from Ancient India organised by the Asiatic Society Library on Tuesday, Dr. Singh, daughter of former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, said while patriarchy seems to be a feature of ancient societies, locating women’s problems in ancient India and contradictory statements in the sources present a problem.“There is a close relationship between the public and political domain on the one hand and the private, personal domain of families and households on the other. Most texts are written by upper class men for upper class men – something that poses a problem in locating women’s problems in ancient India. Women’s voices are scarcely audible,” she said.According to Dr. Singh, women were considered politically relevant figures in ancient texts by the composers of theRamayanaandMahabharata. “In theRamayana, Kaikeiyi is an example and in theMahabharata, it is Draupadi who was an active participant in the debate among Pandavas as an active member of the pro-war party.Arthashastrapresents women, especially royal women, as politically ambitious and active agents; as political support as well as enemies who have to be factored in the political understanding and calculations of the rulers,” she said.Across centuries, the narratives of ancient Indian political history seem to be a history of kingdoms of empires and thrones ruled by men. However, history also gives us several instances of women breaching the glass ceiling and becoming rulers, Dr. Singh said.Episodes of sexual violence in the political domain make the most explicit appearance in theMahabharataandRamayana. “In fact, it is this violence that propels these epic narratives forward. In theMahabharata, Draupadi is often the target. In the Matsya court, a member of the royal family attempts to rape a woman he thinks is a servant. But the fact that these incidents are described in graphic detail and form an important part of the epic narratives, suggest the recognition of sexual violence against women as an important feature of the political domain,” she said."

Rwanda,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/rwanda/article26451894.ece,"
Hop on! Join us as we travel to one country every week and explore its unique culture and history.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"HISTORYRwanda was inhabited by tribal peoples such as the Twa and Hutu for thousands of years. In 1300s, the Tutsi tribe** began to migrate into the region. By the 1400s, a monarchy arose in Rwanda and this was led by a Tutsi King. The Tutsis began to dominate the region and this eventually pushed the Hutu people (the other dominant tribe) to the margins. This created two distinct classes of people: Tutsi lords who were rich land owners and the Hutu who were the lower class labourers.In the late 1800s, Tutsi King Kigeri Rwabugiri established a unified State for the first time and set up a centralised military structure.In 1858, British explorer Hanning Speke became the first European to visit the region. In 1894, German explorer Count Von Goetzen visited Rwanda. After a few years, the kings of Rwanda agreed to become a German protectorate State. However, during World War I, Belgium took control of the country. In 1923, Belgium was granted the League of Nations mandate to indirectly govern Rwanda through Tutsi kings.The growing tension between Hutu and Tutsi people increased during this period, and in 1957, Hutus issued a manifesto calling for a change in Rwanda's power structure and this eventually led to the formation of Hutu political parties. In 1959, a Hutu revolution overthrew the Tutsi monarchy and took control of Rwanda. Over the next few years, many Tutsis were killed and many more fled the country.In 1961, the country was proclaimed a republic. However this did not bring an end to the inter-ethnic violence. In 1990s, tensions rose and a civil war broke out between the two groups. In 1994, a systematic massacre of Tutsis was carried out by the government, which was then led by the Hutus. Over 8,00,000 Tutsi people were killed and millions fled the country. In 1995, the UN appointed an international tribunal to charge and sentence those responsible for the genocide. In 2003, voters backed a draft constitution that banned the incitement of ethnic hatred. Following this, Rwandan politician and former military leader Paul Kagame won in the first Presidential elections since the 1994 genocide. In 2005, the government released thousands of prisoners who were involved in the genocide.In the latest elections held in 2017, Kagame was re-elected as the President. However, the election results were considered unfair by political opponents.RWANDA TODAYSince the early 2000s, Rwanda has worked hard to rebuild its economy through its coffee and tea production. The World Bank has praised the country for its remarkable progress in reducing poverty and inequality in the last few decades. However, Rwanda has a wide range of issues to tackle, such as lack of freedom of the press, lack of political pluralism, improper education and health systems.CUISINERwandan cuisine mostly consists of vegetables. Meat is not eaten very often by most Rwandans. A few commonly used ingredients include bananas, plantains, pulses, sweet potatoes, beans and cassava. Here are a few iconic dishes:Ugali:Ugali is a cornmeal porridge, which is a staple dish in East African countries. The flour is cooked in water or milk and stirred until it reaches a sticky dough-like consistency. Sometimes, other flours such as millet or sorghum flour are also used to make ugali. This dish is usually eaten with stir-fried vegetables or meat.Matoke:Matoke is a variety of banana indigenous to southwest Uganda. The traditional stew is prepared using this banana. Matoke is generally boiled, mashed and sauteed with vegetables, ground peanuts or meat such as beef and goat.

A strange paradox for Indian women,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-strange-paradox-for-indian-women/article26449536.ece,"
Better education is not leading to better job opportunities, marriage prospects or freedom of movement ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Abigail Adams, wife of the second President of the U.S. and mother of the sixth President, wrote to her husband, “If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion.” As last year’s #MeToo movement and Sabarimala protests showed, perhaps Indian women are echoing her and are ready to foment a rebellion.Education and employmentWhat fuels these movements? Could it be that the very success of India’s economic transformation brings with it a stark realisation that it has not paid particular care and attention to women? The most promising sign of the improving conditions of Indian women lies in declining inequality in education. In all villages and towns, mornings and afternoons are brightened by the smiling faces of girls and young women, dressed in their uniforms, walking to school. Almost all girls go to primary school and, according to the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) of 2011-12, 70% of girls aged 15 to 18 are still studying, only five percentage points less than boys. They frequently outperform boys. In 2018, in the Class XII CBSE examination, 88.31% girls passed, compared to 78.99% boys. However, in spite of rising education and rising aspirations, labour markets and social norms constrain women, almost as if they are all dressed up for a party with nowhere to go.Also ReadSurveying India’s unemployment numbersData from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and the IHDS show that education and employment have a U-shaped relationship. Illiterate women are most likely to participate in the workforce. Work participation drops sharply for women with primary and secondary education and rises only with college education. Research by Esha Chatterjee and colleagues in a paper published in the journalDemographic Research,using data from the IHDS, further documents that this relationship holds even after we take into account income of other members of the household, social background and place of residence.Employment opportunities that are open to their mothers, including farm labour and non-farm manual work in construction, hold little appeal to secondary school graduates who have invested their hopes in education. However, white-collar jobs are either not available or demand long hours and offer little job security in this time of a gig economy. NSSO data for 25- to 59-year-old workers in 2011-12 show that among farmers, farm labourers and service workers, nearly one-third are women, while the proportion of women among professionals, managers and clerical workers is only about 15%.Also ReadA place for the womanYoung men with Class 10 or 12 education find jobs as mechanics, drivers, sales representatives, postmen and appliance repairmen. Few of these opportunities are available to women. Whether employers choose not to hire women in these positions or working conditions make for an inhospitable environment for young women is not clear. Educated women’s main employment options lie in qualifying as a nurse or a teacher or looking for office jobs.The importance of marriageIf barriers to work participation are not enough, young women’s lives are also circumscribed by social norms that shape their family situation. Marriage remains the only acceptable fate for young women in India. Whereas a third of Japanese women and 11% of Sri Lankan women aged 30-34 are single, less than 3% of Indian women are single at that age. Moreover, women’s education does not seem to carry the same value in the ‘marriage market’ as caste, the family’s economic status and horoscope. Research from other countries shows that educated women marry similarly educated men. But in India, women frequently marry men with lower education than themselves. Zhiyong Lin and his colleagues at the University of Maryland find that whereas less than 5% women married men whose education was lower than themselves in the 1970s, the proportion has grown to nearly 20% recently.Also ReadThe missing womenIf rising education for women does not offer increasing income-earning opportunities or better marriage prospects, does it at least give women greater autonomy in other areas of their lives? Based on recent National Family Health Survey data, there seems to be little evidence that a moderate level of education offers women a greater say in household decisions or freedom of movement outside the home. College graduates fare slightly better, but even for them, the difference is relatively small. For instance, 48% of women with no schooling do not go to a health centre alone; the proportion for college graduates is only slightly lower at 45%. This is a strange paradox. Parents make tremendous sacrifices to educate their daughters, and young women joyously work hard at school in search of a better life, only to have their aspirations frustrated by economic and social barriers that restrict their opportunities. Is it surprising that periodically their frustration takes the shape of a social movement? What is surprising is that their demands are not more strident, and that no political party has chosen to espouse their cause.Women’s voteIf women were a caste, their cause would be championed by political parties now trying to mobilise caste-based vote banks. We would see proposals for women’s quota in government jobs and higher education. If women were an economic class, we would see subsidies and a variety of other economic incentives showered on them. However, our political process sees women as an extension of the men in their households and assumes that no special effort is needed to win their hearts and minds.Also readStill in the shadows: do Indian women have basic health rights?Archana DattaSociologist Raka Ray has presented a sophisticated analysis of the relationship between political parties and women’s movements. She has argued that in the 1980s and 1990s, the CPI(M) in West Bengal had an ambivalent relationship with its women’s wing, and domestic violence was seen as a function of class oppression, with frustrated, unemployed men beating up their wives. In more recent history, the discourse regarding marriage, divorce and inheritance has been co-opted by communal politics.As we head into an election season, perhaps it would be wise for political parties to remember that women form half the voting population. The American experience is salutary in this regard. The 2018 House of Representatives elections in the U.S. that brought victory to the Democrats were shaped by the Democrats winning women’s votes by an overwhelming margin. According to the PEW Research Centre, Democrats won 59% of women’s vote as opposed to 40% for Republicans; among men, they won 51% versus the 47% won by Republicans. Let us hope that some political party will figure out that women are not simply extensions of their husbands and fathers and campaign on a platform that focuses on creating economic and social opportunities for women.Sonalde Desai is Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, and Professor and Centre Director, NCAER-National Data Innovation Centre.

Preeti Reddy murder: Australian investigators struggle to determine her final movements,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/australian-investigators-struggle-to-determine-final-movements-of-murdered-indian-origin-doctor/article26454409.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The only suspect in themurder of a 32-year-old Indian-origin dentist in Australiatravelled 400 kilometres with the sole purpose of seeing her despite knowing that she was dating another man, police have said, as they struggled to determine what happened in a window of several hours yet to be accounted for on the day of her death.The man suspected of murdering the Sydney dentist Preeti Reddy, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase, with numerous stab wounds, in her car parked in an eastern Sydney street, New South Wales, is another Indian-origin dentist and her ex-boyfriend Harsh Narde.Preeti’s family, however, havedenied that the two used to date.Narde died after his BMW car collided with a truck on the New England Highway on Monday night, a day after his Preeti was reported missing, New South Wales Police (NSW) said.The head-on collision, around 340 kilometres from where Preeti’s body was found, is believed to have been deliberate, they said.Police reportedly believe Narde travelled 400km from Tamworth to Sydney for the continuing education course with the sole purpose of seeing Preeti, despite her telling him: “I’ve moved on, you need to do the same”,The Daily Telegraphreported.“Preeti told him she had met someone else and that it was serious and she was moving to Melbourne,” an anonymous source told the newspaper.A colleague of Preeti and Narde said he last saw the pair chatting animatedly in the hotel lobby following the event on Saturday night.Narde had no history of violence, according to sources.“They looked happy and stayed back to chat after the conference ended at 7pm,” he said.“I knew they (had previously been) in a long-term relationship, many of us did. The bizarre thing I noticed that night was that he took down his Facebook shortly after the conference. It made me wonder why.”A few hours later, Preeti was captured on CCTV inside McDonald’s at the Strand Arcade in Sydney about 2.15am on Sunday.CCTV footage shows her standing at the counter before she appeared to leave alone and walk south on Market St. Further surveillance footage shows her entering the Swissotel foyer about five minutes later.A NSW Police spokesperson said Preeti stayed in the hotel with “a man known to her” overnight.At 11am on Sunday, she spoke to her family over the phone and told them she would have a late breakfast then head home to Penrith. But when she failed to return that night, her family reported her missing to Nepean Police Area Command and created a Facebook page to help find her.Narde was captured on the hotel’s CCTV camera getting help from a hotel porter to lift a large and heavy suitcase into the boot of a car on Sunday afternoon, according toThe Daily Telegraph.The suitcase contained Preeti’s body, which was discovered in the boot of her car on a laneway in Sydney’s eastern suburbs around 9.30pm on Tuesday. She had been stabbed numerous times.While Preeti was still the subject of a missing person’s inquiry on Sunday night, Narde sent a series of text messages, to one of her concerned friends.Friends of Preeti asked Narde about her whereabouts, questioning him via text message at 9.24pm Sunday.In text messages obtained by theDaily Mail, one friend asked if he’d seen or heard from her.“Hey, I spoke to her in person on Saturday evening She said (she was going) home,” he replied in the text messages.When the friend suggested Preeti was maybe sleeping somewhere, he replied: Maybe .And when the friend admitted they were scared Preeti had been missing for so long, Narde said he was too. “I feel disturbed as well am sitting at one place for the last 30 minutes,” he wrote.Detective Superintendent Gavin Dengate revealed officers grilled Narde while Preeti was still the subject of a missing person’s inquiry.In a shocking twist, Narde died about 10pm on Monday night — a day after Preeti was reported missing — in a head-on collision with a truck near Tamworth in what police believe was a deliberate act.A New South Wales (NSW) Police spokeswoman toldnews.com.authat authorities were not looking for any other suspects in relation to Preeti’s murder.Police have since appealed to the public to help them trace Preeti’s final movements.But Mr. Dengate cautioned against speculation as to what happened.We’re looking at the timeline of when they met up, he said. We’re still making inquiries. It is very difficult now, with what’s happened, to get that.“At this stage we know they met up in Sydney, now we’re looking at all the movements between those two to establish exactly what happened,” Mr. Dengate told reporters on Wednesday."

‘They are fomenting communal violence ahead of Lok Sabha elections’
",,"The former MLA and Congress leader Ashok Pattan has alleged that some BJP leaders were trying to foment communal violence and protests in the district by trying to falsely implicate his follower Mohammad Shafi Benne on sedition charge.He told presspersons here on Wednesday that Ramdurg MLA Mahadevappa Yadwad and other BJP leaders made false allegations of anti-nationalism against Mr. Benne and organised protests in the wake of the Lok Sabha elections .On Friday, pro-Pakistan slogans had appeared on the Facebook page of Mr. Benne. BJP protested in Ramdurg and Belagavi and sought his arrest on the charge of sedition. Belagavi district police later found out that the posts were put up by Mr. Benne’s friend-turned-foe Nagaraj Mali, who allegedly sought revenge against him over a financial dispute.“Mr. Yadwad accused me of protecting my follower from police action. His son and relatives gathered outside the police station, stoned some shops and shouted anti-minority slogans near the Ramdurg mosque. The police should take action against all these,” Mr. Pattan said.Angadi flayed“Till now I had thought Suresh Angadi, MP, was a sophisticated gentleman. But he has turned out to be someone different. He has stooped to the level of sitting on the steps of the SP’s office, calling Mr. Benne as an anti-national and seeking his death. He should change his behaviour. He should not do cheap politics for electoral gains,” he said.Mr. Pattan also suspected a conspiracy behind the whole episode and sought a detailed inquiry. “Within five minutes of pro- Pakistan messages appearing on Mr. Benne’s Facebook page, there were 500 people in front of the Ramdurg police station. How is this possible if this was not preplanned?” he wondered.He urged the Union government to amend the law so that persons who falsely implicate others on sedition charges should be hanged to death.The former MLA Firoz Sait, Congress district president Vinay Navalagatti and others were present at the press conference."

How comfortably people can express their fondness for each other in public spaces can speak volumes about a city’s collective camaraderie
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The idea of measuring affection in public space is a radical idea for Indian cities. Here, we are so often stuck with the mind-set of measuring the quantum of violence in public space in order to deter people, especially women, from fully using the space, that when you raise the idea of measuring affection, they look at you as if you are crazy. In any case, we are a nation that has strong opinions against publicly expressed love — witness the annual fervour of various political entities against the celebration of Valentine’s Day — and hence, to assess public space precisely on that basis might seem ludicrous to many.That is until you see the idea unpackaged. The idea of evaluating a city and its public spaces, using an affection barometer, is an exciting concept put out by the New York-based Project for Public Spaces (PPS), a non-profit organisation dedicated to helping cities plan, create and sustain public spaces that make a difference in the lives of the communities and people who inhabit them.Out in the open A public space can evince different emotions and reactions from people who use it
 
| Photo Credit:APAs pioneers of the ‘placemaking movement’, PPS loves to understand how a public place creates meaning for the people who use it. Its founder, Fred Kent, a long-term observer of public spaces, has found that one critical source of meaning is affection. When Kent says ‘affection’, he means not just couples in love (though that is included too) but also emotions such as liking, fondness, warmth, care, regard and friendliness.Good public spaces encourage and bring about closeness and bonding, and we can see this in several ways. Kent says the most obvious is Public Displays of Affection (PDA) such as kissing, hugging or holding hands. But one also sees affection in sharing a drippy ice-cream cone, smiles and maybe a loud laugh. In fact, notes Kent, the affectionate behaviour of couples, families and friends becomes more overt in public, not less.Studying the proximity of people to each other — like how close they sit on a bench — can also be a good indicator, says Kent, of their affectionate relationship to one another, as well as an indicator of ‘social comfort’ between strangers in a public space. According to him, as more people crowd into a space, usually their tolerance for proximity can increase to a point where strangers may sit as close to one another as family members might in a less busy space.A couple sits by the Arabian Sea promenade on in Mumbai
 
| Photo Credit:APWhile affectionate behaviours differ from place to place and culture to culture, what is interesting to note is that any level of affection can invest meaning to a public space. But as PPS points out, that affection and affectionate gestures rely on a deep sense of comfort — a physical and mental ease that people feel with a space. This could be due to the presence of plenty of well-designed street furniture like benches, quick access to reliable food hawkers, comfortable lighting and general atmosphere of safety.Kent also talks about how when a place is pleasant and relaxing, it will be mirrored in the behaviours of people using the space. The key takeaway is that people show their affection for a public space in their affection for each other.Or, as the great American urbanist William H Whyte observed in the 1970s (and Kent worked with him), kissing, smiling, touching, and eye contact are among the best signs that a public space is comfortable and well-loved.That is such a refreshing way to look at affection in city space — not as something to be shunned but to be celebrated. For it speaks of public spaces and a city that is loved and appreciated. The affection displayed tells planners and administrators that the city is doing something right. So let’s take the affection gauge to our favourite places and see if we can up the love!(The author is a Mumbai-based journalist, researcher and co-author ofWhy Loiter?

Voice their grievances at public hearing on Tuesday
",,"“There are no questions asked. Even if I'm going home, I’m dragged to the station and beaten up,” said Sarala (name changed), a sex worker participating in a public hearing on police violence against sex workers on Tuesday.The public hearing, organised by Sadhana Mahila Sangha with support from other organisations, was a result of what is alleged to be ‘a marked increase in harassment by the police, especially in the Bengaluru West Division that covers the City Railway station, Majestic Bus Stand and surrounding areas’.Womens’ rights activist Madhu Bhushan said police violence had waned in the last few years, but has risen again since a year. “The new DCP (Ravi D. Channannavar, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru West) had said he will ‘clean’ Majestic. They decided to target sex workers and transgenders,” she said.Ms. Bhushan said the support group had met the DCP who had assured that sex workers will not be manhandled. “We also explained why these women have chosen this profession. We even held gender sensitisation counselling for their staff. But two weeks later, things were back to as they were. They are using the Obavva squad,” she added.The DCP could not be reached for comments, even after repeated attempts.‘Human rights violation’Referring to the police violence against sex workers as a ‘human rights violation’, she said their meeting with Director-General of Police Neelamani Raju too was not fruitful.“Everyone we approached asked why these women do the work they do. But they are victims of society and patriarchy, not criminals. Why are the police turning into moral police and vigilantes?”Recounting the harassment, Ms. Sarala said ‘women in military outfits’ — referring to the Obavva squad — are sent to take them to the police station. “They ask us to go to the station with them, and we are made to sit there for hours. Then they ask us to pay a fine, for which no receipt is given. I have paid a fine thrice with the amounts ranging from Rs. 200 to Rs. 250,” she alleged.Transgender sex workers complained of being sent to the beggars’ colony and ill-treatment at the police station.Retired HC judge H.N. Nagmohan Das said this was the third such meeting, but more women had spoken up now, which was the first step towards a solution. He suggested that they approach the judiciary as attempts to talk to the police had yielded no results, and said he would ready a report based on the public hearing soon."

The elections dates for both Parliament and Assembly should be announced soon,” said Mr. Tarigami.DPN chief Ghulam Hassan Mir said holding early elections would be a test “whether the ECI was an independent body or was influenced by the Centre”.The BJP said it’s also ready to face the elections. “We expressed our readiness to contest the elections as and when ECI desired it,” said BJP spokesman Altaf Thakur.Meanwhile, the ECI team reviewed “preparedness of various departments of civil and police administration”, besides transportation of EVMs and polling material.The ECI team will visit Jammu on Tuesday and meet political parties there before it leaves for New Delhi to take a final call.J&K first came under the Governor’s rule on June 19, 2018 and under President’s rule on December 19, 2018. The state is without an elected government for around 10 months and the President’s rule will complete its six months in June this year."

India must guard against the type of politics that shaped, and continues to ruin, Pakistan ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“Our fight is for Kashmir, not against Kashmiris,”Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a Bharatiya Janata Party rallyat Tonk in Rajasthan on February 23, which it now turns out was setting the scene for the military strike inside Pakistan three days later. The Indian strikes followed a suicide terrorist attack that killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnelon February 14 in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir. The Jaish-e-Mohammad, a jihadi group that operates from Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.Mr. Modi spoke in some detail to explain how violence against Kashmiris that erupted in other parts of India could strengthen divisive forces, but the same speech had another statement that showed where the edge of his politics is. “I regret how some people who live in India continue to speak the language of Pakistan,” he said. It is this pronouncement of the Prime Minister that has caught on following the Indian air strikes. On Sunday in Patna,he accused all Opposition parties and professionalswho have raised questions regarding India’s Pakistan and Kashmir policy of helping Pakistan.A fifth column?‘People who live in India but are loyal to Pakistan’, a fifth column that threatens the nation, has been a recurring allusion in Sangh Parivar politics. Mr. Modi has, like he has done with several components of Hindutva politics, raised this to a higher pitch. In October 2017, Congress leader P. Chidambaram said in response to the appointment of a new Government of India interlocutor for Jammu and Kashmir, Dineshwar Sharma: “Thedemand in Kashmir Valley is to respectin letter and spirit Article 370. And that means that they want greater autonomy… Therefore, I think we should seriously examine that question and consider on what areas we can give autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir.” Mr. Modi responded: “Why are Congress leaders lending their voice to those who want azaadi in Kashmir? Congress is shamelessly using the language that is used by separatists in Kashmir and is spoken in Pakistan.” Mr. Modi’s statement ended Mr. Sharma’s mission as soon as it was announced and the former chief of the Intelligence Bureau is now cooling his heels.Also ReadThe challenge in the Pulwama attack“If the BJP loses in Bihar by mistake, then victory-defeat will be in Bihar but crackers will be burst in Pakistan,” BJP president Amit Shah had said during the 2015 Assembly election campaign in the State. If that insinuation is not self-explanatory, Mr. Modi went a step ahead in the 2017 Gujarat campaign: “Pakistan’s former army director general Arshad Rafiq said that in Gujarat, Ahmed Patel [political secretary to then-Congress president Sonia Gandhi] should be made the Chief Minister.” He went on to accuse his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, and the Opposition Congress party of being in collusion with Pakistan to make an Indian Muslim the State’s Chief Minister.According to the notion of citizenship and territory in what may be called the Hindutva Strategic Doctrine, Indian Muslims are often understood as an appendage of Pakistan. This is not a thought that comes out only in campaign rhetoric. Jaswant Singh writes of the India-Pakistan rivalry that Partition “compartmentalised and then tightly sealed the Hindu-Muslim animosities; cementing festering grudges into near permanent hostilities; what was domestic (Hindu-Muslim) became international (India-Pakistan).”Also ReadTerrible Thursday: on Pulwama terror attackThe Congress’s Pakistan policy “in effect was only an extension of Congress’s Muslim appeasement policy,” wrote A.B. Vajpayee in 1973, only two years after the Bangladesh war. When India’s Pakistan policy is understood only as “appeasement” of Indian Muslims, one Hindutva leader thought the best way to reach out to Indian Muslims was to appease Pakistan. That led to L.K. Advani travelling all the way to Karachi and praising Mohammad Ali Jinnah in 2005. That move, however, boomeranged, set him on the downslide and paved the way for the launch of his loyalist, Mr. Modi, who would displace him as the more authentic bearer of the Hindutva mantle.Mr. Modi made Pakistan a leitmotif for Hindutva mobilisation in which the idea of an external enemy and an internal alien fuses into a convenient ensemble. He perfected this tool in the 2002 Gujarat campaign, which was almost entirely on ‘Mian Musharraf,’ a reference to the then military dictator of Pakistan. “Speak to Pakistan in the language Pakistan understands,” Mr. Modi said in 2013, when asked what he would have done if he were the Prime Minister during the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.Post-Pulwama air strikesLast week’s military strike inside Pakistan has been characterised by many as a clean break from the past. The real break from the past came in 2014 itself when Mr. Modi called off a scheduled bilateral meeting with Pakistan citing its High Commissioner’s meeting with Kashmiri separatists, a routine affair. Mr. Modi overturned Vajpayee’s Kashmir policy which had three components: empower regional mainstream parties, engage the separatists, and involve Pakistan. Mr. Modi shut Pakistan out of the equation; disengaged with the separatist groups; and has constantly undermined the mainstream parties in the State, namely the Peoples Democratic Party and the National Conference, in the last five years. A principle that the current government has followed in faith and the practice is that there is nothing to be negotiated with anyone in Kashmir or about Kashmir with anyone, least of all Pakistan. Anyone suggesting anything out of line with this is accused of talking the language of Pakistan.Also ReadAfter Pulwama, a sorry responseIf Pakistan is projected as representing the internal and external threats to the nation, Kashmir becomes the location of Hindu victimhood, an essential component of Hindutva mobilisation. The massive violence and dispossession faced by the Hindus in the Valley at the hands of jihadis validates the Hindutva notion that the community is a victim of appeasement of Muslims, which is otherwise impossible to establish. Conversely, Kashmir also becomes the site for the demonstration of the resolve of the ‘New India’ where ‘appeasement’ is replaced with brute show of strength.‘Internal enemies’The cries for revenge against ‘internal enemies’ is getting louder and shriller, pushing the entire country to the edge. “India’s biggest threat comes from its own invisible internal enemies,” a Hindi film director posted on Twitter along with a video clip of National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, in which he makes the case that India never lost to a foreign power unless betrayed by internal enemies. A Delhi lawmaker, formerly of the Aam Aadmi Party and now a Modi supporter, circulated a video last week, in which he asks Mr. Modi to deal with the enemies across the border while offering that people would meanwhile deal with the traitors inside. YouTube has since removed the video, but the lawmaker has found support on social media. “Deal with them right now, the mood in the country is suitable,” a ‘spiritual guru’ told a prime time anchor who helpfully asked what is to be done with those who are against India.This level of intolerance and call for mindless violence, fuelled by religious majoritarianism, and calls to cleanse the nation of internal enemies are indeed the language that first shaped but continues to ruin Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi is right — it is a matter of grave concern; a lynch mob might just succeed where the suicide bomber has repeatedly failed.

Demands punishment of the killers according to tribal law
",,"The family of one of the three men killed during mob violence in Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar last month has declined the compensation offered by the State government and demanded punishment of the “killers” according to tribal customary law.A 48-hour shutdown against the government’s move to grant permanent resident certificates to six non-tribal groups had taken an ugly turn on February 22. Risso Tari, 22, was killed that day while Biji Ruja, 20, and Tsering Wangdi, 34, were killed in police firing near Chief Minister Pema Khandu’s private residence on February 24.Mr. Khandu later announced compensation of ₹20 lakh and a government job for the next of kin of each of the deceased and up to ₹10 lakh for the injured. “My brother Tari’s death was cold-blooded murder by the security personnel since Home Minister Kumar Waii said he did not order the security forces to open fire. Instead of money and job, we want his murderers to be handed over to us for trial under Nyishi [tribe] customary law,” Risso Kiagung told newspersons in Itanagar on Saturday.Call for compensationCustomary laws, often in conflict with the judicial system, prescribe punishments according to the degree of seriousness of a crime. They range from caging a culprit and pouring itching powder on him to death by lynching.Mr. Risso also sought action against the organisations that called the “illegal” shutdown that led to the death of his brother and two others.The Khandu government, meanwhile, has been flooded with demand for compensation from shops and business establishments that were razed or plundered by mobs during the violent agitation. Assam and Nagaland-based musicians and suppliers of equipment for the vandalised Itanagar International Film Festival have sought compensation for their losses, too. “People of the city and the agitators looted almost everything we had on display. If we don’t get compensation for the goods stolen and property damaged, we might have to shut down,” the local manager of a shopping mall chain said. The affected malls have assured to pay their employees for at least two months, by which time they expect a compensation package for rebuilding. “We are staring at job cuts for at least 200 local youth,” he said."
The difference between journalism and propaganda,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/Readers-Editor/the-difference-between-journalism-and-propaganda/article26424961.ece,"
Journalists should report events rather than become cheerleaders for hate politics and intolerance
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Since the terrorist attack inPulwama that killed 40 CRPF personneland the subsequent military response, there have been two distinct narratives in the media. On the one hand is an uncritical group of people who constantly whip up patriotism and construct nationalism in a narrow sense. They are keen to reduce journalism to propaganda. On the other is a set of professionals who continue to retain their commitment to the core values of journalism and opt to report events instead of becoming a tool of war.Reporting war and conflictThe reportage and headlines ofThe Hinduexhibit a commitment to facts as well as a desire to minimise tension between two neighbours. Here journalism is a public good and refuses to become an instrument of deceit. The headline of Feb. 28, “IAF plane shot down, pilot taken captive by Pak. army”, was both appreciated and vilified by readers. The people who felt that the headline was not patriotic enough drew their inspiration from many broadcast journalists. I would urge them to watch senior journalist Sashi Kumar’s video, “Parasites of prime time”, in which he clearly establishes how dominant TV channels have become cheerleaders for hate politics and intolerance.My friend and the founder of the Ethical Journalism Network, Aidan White, never tires of pointing out a simple fact: that journalists who work in or near a conflict zone see first-hand the brutal and inhumane consequences of war. The act of bearing witness helps them refrain from promoting propaganda based on what he calls “skewed notions of romantic patriotism or tribal allegiance”. There is a huge corpus of literature on war and conflict journalism. One fact emerges from such literature and from war reporters — from the time of the World Wars to my colleagues who have covered more recent wars in the neighbourhood: those who bay for blood are far removed from the sites of violence and do not have a sense of the loss and pain experienced by families. In his insightful book,The First Casualty, Phillip Knightley gives us an important warning: “The sad truth is that today government propaganda prepares its citizens for war so skilfully that it is quite likely that they do not want the truthful, objective and balanced reporting that hero war correspondents once did their best to provide.”Fact and fictionSoon afterIndia’s air strikes in Balakot, Pakistan, many TV channels citing anonymous sources claimed that the attack across the LoC killed 300 terrorists. However, when the official version was put out, the government spokesperson refused to speculate on the number. Meanwhile, international mediapersons, who have access to Balakot, visited the site. Their findings made a mockery of many of the tall claims that were being made from India’s TV studios. In this newspaper, a sober and responsible analysis was made much before Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s capture. For instance, in his comment piece, “India’s options after Pulwama” (Feb. 19), Happymon Jacob examined the option of using strike aircraft to carry out precision strikes in locations across the LoC. He presciently warned: “But such air incursions are likely to be detected and intercepted by Pakistani radars and air defence systems. If an aircraft is shot down or pilots are captured, it could become a bigger headache for the government. Pakistani retaliatory strikes cannot be ruled out either.”Writer Namita Gokhale made an important observation recently: “One of the greatest life learnings of the ever contemporary Mahabharata is the lesson of the Chakravyuh and the consequences of entering it without full foreknowledge.” Her tweet doesn’t apply only to governance and military affairs, but to journalism too. The very act of verification that differentiates this profession from all other forms of communication tells us not be an Abhimanyu, one who knew the entry strategy but not the exit one.Indian journalists have made some of the most incisive arguments against the pernicious idea of embedded journalism (the practice of placing journalists under the control of one side’s military during an armed conflict). The difference between journalism and propaganda lies in the language that is used in reports. Ethical journalism will report the killing of a soldier as the killing of a soldier and refrain from using loaded propagandist words like martyr.[email protected]"

Powerful performances by artistes who were “loitering with purpose” sent hard-hitting messages against the Central government.The event organisers said that there was a need for artistes to unite in protest as it was a time when cultural and social life in the country was being torn asunder by a “toxic cocktail of propaganda, violence, censorship and distorted histories”.“The right to life, the right to love, food choices, language and histories, cultural expression, all are under assault by a politics of hate which is at war with the people of India and their diverse cultures,” said a statement by artistes.‘Artistes Unite’ was an idea that came to life during the ‘Not in My Name!’ campaign that started in 2017.“We will fight hate with love. We will counter violence with peace. Through our images, speech, words, music and bodies we will resist the cultural destruction of India,” read a declaration that has been signed by over 700 artistes."

The reasons behind India’s restraint after the 26/11 attacks are still valid today ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The February 26aerial strike by India on a Jaish-e-Mohammad(JeM) training camp in Balakot, located in Mansehra district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, came hardly a fortnight after thePulwama terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoyon the Srinagar-Jammu highway. The terror attack was carried out by a JeM suicide bomber, who rammed his explosives laden vehicle into the convoy, killing 40 CRPF personnel.Also ReadThe week after: on India-Pak relationsThe Pulwama attack on February 14 was the deadliest attack to date on security forces in Kashmir. It was seen as a message to India that ‘Terror Incorporated’ in Pakistan was upping the ante and taking matters to a qualitatively higher level. That it chose to do so when the general election in India is around the corner further made it an act of dare-devilry, almost inviting India to retaliate.Turning pointThe aerial attack featured Mirage-2000 jets (designed to fly at speeds of up to Mach 2.2) fitted with state-of-the-art radar and fly-by-wire flight control systems, carrying precision guided missiles. Sukhoi Su-30MKI jets were standing by, and early warning aircraft — the Israeli Phalcon and the indigenously built Netra — were also deployed. The reliance on air power not only induced a new pattern in the India-Pakistan conflict post-1971, but also marks a paradigmatic change in the nature and character of India’s battle against Pakistan-based terror.Also ReadAbhinandan was not released under any pressure: PakistanTwo dates, 1971 and 1998, are significant in this context. The first witnessed the dismemberment of Pakistan, accompanied by Pakistan’s unremitting hostility towards India. The second marked the year when India and Pakistan formally announced their emergence as nuclear powers — leading to a kind of stand-off between them. Between 1971 and 1998, the South Asian region witnessed the retreat from Afghanistan of Russian forces, and the simultaneous emergence of the phenomenon known as the ‘Afghan Jihad’. The latter would thereafter spawn radicalised Islamist violence across the entire region and even beyond, giving rise to organisations such as al-Qaeda and its acolytes. In Kashmir, it led to a shift in tactics, and the commencement of a more radicalised and militant phase of struggle. Kashmir has never been the same since.Pakistan was the main beneficiary of this. It gained control of the Taliban, which soon achieved ascendancy in Afghanistan’s affairs. Recruits and tactics from the Afghan Jihad helped intensify the struggle in Kashmir and tilt it in favour of Pakistan. Terror, thereafter, became the strategic instrumentality employed to keep India in check. That is, until the February 14 attack on the CRPF convoy in Pulwama.A big provocationPulwama was the ultimate provocation. The suicide bomber detonated between 80 and 90 kg of explosives, which experts have identified as RDX, categorised as a military grade explosive available with the armed forces. Preparation for the attack suggests that it was not a one-off event, and that the planning had commenced much earlier. Preparing a suicide bomber to carry out an attack entails a great deal of psychological training, which is conducted over a considerable length of time (this pattern was seen in the case of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and of suicide bomber Dhanu responsible for Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination). Intelligence available suggests that the suicide bomber was assisted, guided and propelled to achieve maximum impact by handlers in Pakistan. The radicalised suicide bomber (Adil Ahmad Dar) was apparently spotted by JeM masterminds in Pakistan many months prior to the attack, and Pakistan controllers continued their ‘handholding’ almost till the last minute. Pakistan’s fingerprints are all over the Pulwama incident.Also ReadNobody wants war, but neither can we tolerate terrorism: Air Marshal Hari KumarIndia’s decision to carry the battle beyond the Line of Control and into Pakistan has several implications. At its most basic level, it signifies that in the battle against terror, India is more than willing currently to side-step protocols that dictate conduct among nations not officially at war. No amount of euphuistic chicanery alters this reality.We live in a highly disruptive world. Nations often find themselves in a state of undeclared war. Tensions and provocations between countries that share borders — among the more prominent being North and South Korea — often remain high. In the present instance, a strong riposte by India was only to be expected, with the debate centring round the degree of restraint to be exercised. Whether an aerial attack on a terror target inside Pakistani territory comes within the ambit of a credible minimum deterrent is, however, debatable.Employment of air power is per se recognised the world over as an escalatory step. No amount of diplomatic verbiage can obscure this fact. The phrase ‘non-military pre-emptive strike’ used by the Indian Foreign Secretary and other officials does not in any way change this reality. The nation, hence, needs to brace itself for the consequences that follow such a step. Any hope that international opprobrium on Pakistan for the JeM attack would deter Pakistan from taking a retaliatory step for the attack on Balakot needs to be eschewed.Also ReadThink like a civilisationThe reality is that while few would sympathise with Pakistan, well recognised as a country that harbours terrorists of every description, there are much larger issues at stake. There is the matter of maintaining the sanctity of the Westphalian Order, which has helped keep the peace across the world for centuries. This mandates certain rules and procedures as far as the conduct of international relations is concerned. Violation of the territory of another country, whether from land, sea or air, whatever be the degree of provocation, is generally perceived as an act of war. Today, Russia is being pilloried by the West for the former’s annexation of Crimea. Russia is also being castigated for interfering in the U.S. presidential elections in 2016. Yet, all countries, including the U.S., have been reluctant to cross the Rubicon and enter into an open confrontation with Russia.This should, hence, give us reason to pause, and to debate whether the world could construe our action of violating Pakistani airspace, even if it is to carry out an attack on a JeM training centre, as justified or not. There is little doubt that India’s policy-makers took the decision to carry out the attack on Balakot — even if it meant violating Pakistan airspace — only after a great deal of deliberation, but it is still a highly debatable step.Dilemma after 26/11Understandably, no two situations are identical. Nor are the conditions prevailing the same at any time. In November/December 2008, on the eve of the general election of 2009, India confronted a similar dilemma following the November 2008 terror attack by Pakistan’s Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) on multiple targets in Mumbai city (picture), in which nearly 170 persons were killed. Extensive discussions were held at that time as to the possible actions that could be taken against Pakistan, and many ideas were considered — including that of similar pre-emptive strikes on terror training camps along the LoC and beyond — and given up.Also ReadLiving on the edgeThe reality was — and this still exists — that India did not possess the kind of special forces (with the requisite capabilities) that other countries had, viz. Russia’s Spetsnaz, Germany’s GSG-9, the U.S.’s SEALS and the U.K.’s SAS and SBS. It was felt at the time that it would not be possible in the circumstances to carry out a pinpointed attack on either the LeT or JeM headquarters. Whether India should violate Pakistan’s airspace was also carefully deliberated upon, but wiser counsels at the time felt that this would be perceived as nothing short of war. The failure to take action is being reviled today in certain circles, but it needs to be remembered that some of India’s finest years were during the period 2009-2012.Upholding India’s wordAlso ReadFrom Pulwama terror attack to Wg Cmdr Abhinandan's release: a timelineIt may be said that having already taken the step, there can be no going back. India’s leaders, however, need to be reminded that India’s restraint in responding to previous terror attacks is the crucial factor giving India credibility as far as keeping commitments are concerned. It is important to recognise in this context that India is committed to‘No First Use’ in nuclear matters, and the world has accepted this guarantee purely based on India’s moral capital and stature. The question is whether India’s word will be treated as inviolable in the future, even as India seeks a seat as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. This is something that we need to ponder over.M.K. Narayanan is a former National Security Adviser and a former Governor of West Bengal."

Aritsts, performers hold rally against hate
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Thousands of artists and performers from theatre, music, films and folk culture on Saturday participated in a rally seeking a united future for democracy and against hate. With the Lok Sabha polls around the corner, the walk was aimed at calling out violence and envisioning a future that is equitable, just and free.Held from the Reti Bunder in Mahim to Carter Road in Bandra, the walk organised by the 2020 Group, a self-organised coalition of Mumbai-based artists, architects, filmmakers, cultural administration and live art practitioners, was part of a nation-wide day of art and culture. Among the participants were actor Kalki Koechlin and filmmaker Amol Palekar.“Lots of plays and films have been censored. It is important to express healthiness of debate against hate,” Ms. Koechlin toldThe Hindu. Theatre actor Dolly Thakore said, “The things happening around us are affecting everybody. We do not want a country where intelligence is undermined and there is a division.”A group of artists usingdindi, a devotional dance form from Maharashtra, to speak up against hate and create an atmosphere of dissent stood out. Sanjukta Wagh, who was a part of the group, said, “The Warkari saint poets, along with Kabir and Khusrau, have been great unifiers. We remember the great reformers of our times and those who have been silenced. Their spirits live through our songs.”A group dressed as school students, with books covered in brown paper in their hands, marched for ‘desaffronising’ of textbooks, history and culture."

Two books on the election process and why Indian voters take it seriously
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Elections have a lot to do with numbers, but they are not only about numbers. These two volumes, timed for the 17th general election of India that already gives us a sense of foreboding for the fractious social milieu in the country, prompt us to reflect and engage with India’s democratic process in an intimate and more responsible way. One is edited by S.Y. Quraishi and the other is written by Navin Chawla.Both were chief election commissioners (CEC) of India, both worked together as election commissioners and both have previous books that showed their remarkable ability of storytelling. They do not disappoint us in the latest offerings.Many facetsQuraishi’s edited volume is on a range of election-related topics randomly selected and has some unpredictable authors such as Ratan Tata and Naina Lal Kidwai alongside several well-known election experts like Ornit Shani, Gilles Verniers and Yogendra Yadav.Two politicians, the late Somnath Chatterjee, and Shashi Tharoor, also offer their unique perspectives. Collectively, these essays give us enticing glimpses of the many facets of Indian elections, including historical, legal and comparative. Milan Vaishnav’s essay on confronting the influence of money and Rahul Verma’s on the roll of opinion polls and electronic media deal with the challenges to the sanctity of the electoral process.A particularly outstanding piece in the collection is by Mukulika Banerjee on ‘why does India vote.’ Indian voters take the act of voting as sacrosanct and see it as an exercise of their equal status as citizens, her qualitative survey suggests. The act of voting itself is a form of empowerment for them.Yadav’s essay examines how the electorate negotiates its terms with the state through elections, and also some paradoxical features of Indian democracy, where popular aspirations are realised in very modest measure but the popular trust in the system continues.Voting patternsEvery Vote Countsis Chawla’s account from the CEC’s perch, but it is also laced with anecdotes and snippets from history, court judgments and engages with global concerns such as fake news and unregulated propaganda that threaten democracy. While the ECI has over the years worked hard to keep the integrity of the election process intact, accusations of tampering is as old as the elections themselves. One news report, without proof, said in 1952 the steel ballot boxes could be tampered without removing its seal! Incidentally, the maximum expenditure a candidate was allowed in a Lok Sabha constituency then was Rs. 7,000. Both Quraishi and Chawla make the point that the ECI was constituted a day before the Republic Day, in 1950 — a fact that underscores the criticality of free and fair elections in the sustenance and nourishment of a democracy. Chawla tells us about the lone voter in the Gir sanctuary for whom a booth is set up and an election party travels several kilometres, an election team that trekked 45 km up the Himalayas through snow for two days to reach a booth in 2009 in Jammu and Kashmir — all to ensure that the last woman in the periphery has a say in the affairs of this vast country, however imperfect it may be.A lot of Chawla’s recollections are from the 2009 Lok Sabha election when he was CEC, but a more evocative section in the current context is on the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly election of 2008. The author, who otherwise maintains a detached poise as he narrates moments that he is personally involved in, is passionate in his description of how he fought the then CEC N. Gopalaswamy to ensure that elections were held in time in the troubled State. The CEC was opposed to conducting the elections then. As it turns out, Chawla and Quraishi, both commissioners, pushed ahead with the elections amid turmoil. He also recounts in some detail how one of his predecessors J.M. Lyngdoh walked the extra mile in 2002 to restore the lost credibility and integrity of the election process in the State, which was one reason for Jammu and Kashmir’s aggravating alienation from the rest of India and militancy.In 2008, the ECI built on that to enhance the popular trust in the system. The line between democracy and majoritarianism is breached with violence and impunity these days.

"‘Not law, but mass movement needed to deal with discrimination’",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/not-law-but-mass-movement-needed-to-deal-with-discrimination/article26422597.ece,,,"What started off as an exploration to find a comprehensive law against caste-based discrimination, ended with a sobering realisation for two activists: laws do little to curb the complex nuances of discrimination and instead a mass grass roots movement may be necessary.Four years ago, Sunil Mohan and Rumi Harish, both transgender activists, set out to talk to activists and scholars to understand forms of caste discrimination and find a legal solution to it. Their report, ‘Conversation on Caste Discrimination in South India’ released on Saturday, comes to the conclusion that a comprehensive law would be fraught with “legal, conceptual and administrative loopholes.” The report is published by Alternative Law Forum.“The discrimination of Dalits close to Tumakuru is different from the discrimination in Mandya. There are so many forms of discrimination that no law can cover them all,” says Rumi Harish.InterviewsTheir interviews with over 90 activists in four States in South India point to several loopholes in existing laws. For instance, they quote instances of people from socio-economically castes finding it difficult to find houses on rent from upper-caste landlords. The discrimination is more subtle, but difficult to prove in a law where the burden of proof is on the victim. Over four years, the activists explore the various forms of discrimination in education, livelihood, among others.“The legal and psychological violence from upper-castes is widely prevalent and spread. Look at the food restrictions and the vilification of non-vegetarian food even in hostels,” says C.G .Lakshmipathi, social scientist.Sunny M. Kappikad, Dalit rights activist and scholar, said: “Our existence itself is a form of discrimination. The tradition system (referring to Manusmriti) has dominated and remains a hurdle in inclusiveness.”"
Fishy tales from West Bengal,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/fishy-tales-from-west-bengal/article26422160.ece,"
Bengal’s film industry might have a crush on Mamata Banerjee, but Anik Dutta’s cinema has been consistently political. Any surprise that his latest film suddenly went off theatres?
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When Anik Dutta’s first filmBhooter Bhabishyat(2012), made on a budget of Rs. 60 lakh, (officially) earned Rs. 3 crore, it surprised everyone, including Dutta. It was arguably the biggest hit in the Bengali film industry, made by a man who had been trying to make a film for 20 years and failing.In the film, the plan to tear down an elegant old house and build a jazzy mall threatens the ghosts who live there. They refuse to live in a shiny new place, unlike the more accommodating ghosts in some recent Hindi films. As ever, Bengalis have to be difficult. The intimidation crew tasked to secure the property is made up of goondas on political party rolls, a direct pointer to cadres of the Left Front party (who’ve since been signed up by Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress).Beating melancholiaMore than anything, the film was a cheerful political satire in the tradition of Satyajit Ray’sGoopy Gyne Bagha Byne(1969) andHirak Rajar Deshe(1980). The industry had seen a renewal in the 90s with the intimate and prolific work of the late Rituparno Ghosh. But Ghosh worked in the domain of gender and sexual politics, his films didn’t explorepoliticspolitics. Besides, Bengalis have a talent formon-kharap— melancholia — and the work of the most celebrated filmmakers, from Ritwik Ghatak to Rituparno Ghosh, even the later films of Ray and Mrinal Sen, is suffused with brooding. This is not to say their films are not funny or don’t contain joy, but the overall aura is bleak. In contrast, Dutta, an adman with an affinity for punning, brought to his film something akin to glee. The ghosts win, of course, and so the ulcerous reality of the real estate mafia, their toxic nexus with political parties, the citizens’ powerlessness, feels laughable for a moment.That was 2012. The previous year, Mamata Banerjee had defeated the Left Front that had governed West Bengal for 34 years straight. It was the year Sujoy Ghosh’sKahaanimade Kolkata look like never before — an enigmatic, energetic city where insurance salesmen who don’t meet their sales targets make sure to hit their assassination targets. And a sharp political film likeBhooter Bhabishyatwas among the biggest hits that year. Somehow, Kolkata felt full of possibility.In 2013, news broke of the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams. Millions of poor, small investors were cheated of their savings. The Saradha group had a finger in every pie, including media, film production and real estate. And these media houses unambiguously supported the Trinamool. In his next film,Aschorjyo Prodeep(2013), Dutta showed a Kolkata full of jazzy gated colonies, shiny restaurants, lounges and salons. Exactly the sort of ‘development’ the Trinamool had been promising. I don’t know if it was intentional, but the production design of the film was tacky — like the Big Ben replica that’s been constructed in the heart of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. At one point in the film, the hero says: “What’s the point of going to London? London is here!” It was a direct dig at the Chief Minister, who had said a number of times that Kolkata would become London.Star powerIt’s not thatporiborton(change) has not happened. Something does feel different about Kolkata now, and not all of it is bad. This is not the space to talk about other policies, but one of the visible changes is in the Bengali entertainment industry, which now has a confidence that was not there even when Ghosh got Bollywood stars like Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan to shoot Bengali films in Kolkata. The number of film and TV hoardings in the city have noticeably grown in the past eight years or so.The industry enjoys a close relationship with the Chief Minister. Of the 34 Trinamool MPs in the Lok Sabha, five are actors (Moon Moon Sen, Dev, Satabdi Roy, Sandhya Roy and Tapas Pal). The BJP, with 268 MPs, has seven actors. In 2014, Bengali superstar Dev accompanied the Chief Minister’s delegation on her maiden trip abroad (to Singapore). The Chief Minister’s campaign trail sometimes has filmstars making cameo appearances. At a rally in Murshidabad in 2014, the sisters Riya and Raima Sen popped out of Didi’s helicopter to speak for 45 seconds; 45 seconds of English with a couple of Bengali words thrown in. In September 2018, journalist Indranil Roy pointed to the similarity between Dev’s new filmHoichoi Unlimitedand a Pakistani film, and was picked up by the Kolkata police for questioning.Silent on some stuffThe closeness between the Trinamool and Tollywood, as Kolkata’s film industry is called, has not resulted in direct propaganda films of the sort Bollywood has made. So far, there’s been no film on Kanyashree, the government’s award-winning girl child education scheme, like the Bollywood films on Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. Nor a biopic yet on the Chief Minister. Tollywood has instead made interesting, even aesthetic films, on transgender lives (Nagarkirtan, 2019,Chitrangada, 2012), handsome period pieces (Ek Je Chhilo Raja, 2018), detective stories, and films on Muslim marginalisation and crime networks (Zulfiqar, 2016), but has steered clear of present-day politics.Dutta’s third filmMeghnadbodh Rohoshyo(2017), a beautifully-made thriller, is also political. It confronts the complicit silence of the Bengali middle and upper-middle class to the brutal State suppression of the Naxalite movement in the 70s. Films (including those of Ray and Mrinal Sen) and novels have chronicled the romance and restlessness of those years and the tyranny unleashed by the Congress government. What they haven’t spoken of is the disowning of the Naxalites by their own friends and family. Only Mahasweta Devi’sHajaar Churashir Maa(1974) addressed this guilt. Jhumpa Lahiri’s novelThe Lowland(2013) and Dutta’sMeghnadbadh Rahasyaare a part of this delayed reckoning.Dutta is a straight talker. At the Kolkata International Film Festival last year, he was a speaker on a panel about filmmaking. When asked whether the director was more important or the producer, Dutta said the Chief Minister was the most important, given the number of her photographs on the festival promotional material. “Right then, I knew this guy would get into trouble,” said filmmaker Judhajit Sarkar.Bhobishyoter Bhoot, Dutta’s fourth film, which was taken off theatres last month, is a political satire that indicts all political parties equally. It is believed to have reserved its sharpest barbs for the ‘Chhinnomool Party’. On February 11, one of its producers received a letter from the Kolkata Police’s intelligence branch requesting a private screening because the police had “received inputs” that the film contained elements that may incite “public sentiments”. On February 16, the film quietly and suddenly stopped playing in theatres after running for just a day. UnlikePadmaavat(2018), whose release Chief Minister Banerjee supported, there was no violence around this film, no noise, no threats. Only silence.The writer is an independent journalist based in Kolkata.

He will face trial in May and is presently being held on a $1 million bond.Natives of Kerala, Sini and Wesley Mathews had adopted Sherin from an orphanage in Bihar in July, 2016. Sherin disappeared on October 7, 2017 and Wesley had initially claimed that he had sent her out in the wee hours as punishment for not drinking her milk.On October 22, 2017, Sherin’s body was recovered from a culvert under a road, about a kilometre from her adoptive parents’ house. The cause of Sherin’s death could not be investigated as the body had decomposed.After Sherin’s body was found, Wesley had changed his version that he had tried to feed her milk and she had choked on it. He had also admitted that a day before she died, the couple had left Sherin behind and taken their biological daughter, then aged four, out for dinner.Wesley was indicted for capital murder by a grand jury and for tampering with evidence. Ms. Mathews was charged with endangering a child. They gave up the parental rights of their biological daughter in January, 2018 and the girl has been with the Social Services since.An autopsy report in January, 2018 showed that Sherin had died of homicidal violence.The Indian government revoked the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) for Sini and Wesley last September."
China’s bid to woo the ‘swing’ kingdom,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/chinas-bid-to-woo-the-swing-kingdom/article26422167.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"China unrolled the red carpet for the visiting Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, who was in Beijing in February on a high-profile visit.The harsh winter chill in the Chinese capital had not abated, but there were visible signs that the spring was breaking out in ties between Beijing and Riyadh.There was plenty to breed hope among the mandarins in Beijing that Saudi Arabia — a swing state in the Arab world — could be persuaded to widen its distance from the United States, and become part of an emerging multipolar world.For starters, Saudi Arabia, under the direction of the Crown Prince — widely seen as thede factoruler from the House of Saud — had already embarked on an “Act East” policy. It meant that the oil-rich nation was doctrinally on course to balancing its ties between the West and the East.Riyadh’s soft powerThe Chinese, in their extraordinary effort to woo the Crown Prince, were aware that Riyadh pulled considerable weight in the Arab world and beyond. This was not only because of Riyadh’s economic heft. It was also because of its unique soft power.Saudi Arabia is the custodian of the two holy mosques of Islam. Millions of Muslims land at Jeddah Airport, en route for the annual Haj pilgrimage, woven through great Islamic cities of Mecca, and the nearby Medina.Saudi Arabia’s word thus echoed, with some natural deference, among millions residing in all the five continents, including the parchlands of Xinjiang in China.Xinjiang has been critical to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a giant connectivity project, on account of its prized strategic location. It is also the gateway to Central Asia — a critical piece of geography that opens out towards Russia and Europe, with spurs leading into Iran to the south and the vast grasslands of Mongolia to the north.For decades, Xinjiang has been restive, mainly due to the reluctance of the ethnic Uighurs — of Turkic origin — to enmesh with China’s dominant Han culture. China has used all the proven tools — massive economic development, modern secular education, psychological dissuasion away from radicalism and use of significant force.Yet, the multi-pronged approach to align Xinjiang with the national mainstream has only yielded mixed results.Sporadic violence, speared by the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, a UN-recognised terrorist group, continues to erupt. Human rights groups have also cited mass internment of the alleged dissenters in “re-education” camps in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.So, when the Crown Prince arrived from Pakistan and India — visits meant to demonstrate his “Look East” impulses — the Chinese were keen to have him on-board their Xinjiang narrative.If MBS, as the Crown Prince is widely known, could agree that restiveness in Xinjiang was not a human rights problem, but an expression of violent ethnic separatism, that would energise China’s global public relations campaign significantly. It would also help dent the scathing recent diplomatic assault on China by Turkey on the alleged repression of its Turkic brethren in Xinjiang.Prince Mohammed responded well to China’s ardent urgings. Chinese media cited his unqualified support for the “One-China” policy. In non-diplomatic language, it meant a rejection of all demands for a separate state in Xinjiang, Tibet and Taiwan.“We respect and support China’s rights to take counterterrorism and de-extremism measures to safeguard national security,” Xinhua quoted MBS as saying. The Saudi Royal also backed the BRI.China, in turn, was ready to merge the BRI with Vision-2030 of the Kingdom — an initiative to diversify its economy.Huawei — a telecom giant which is facing a boycott campaign by the Donald Trump administration — made a resounding statement during the visit that Saudi Arabia would be among the first to receive its most advanced 5G wireless technology.China’s offer was greased with a deal with Saudi Aramco to set up a $10 billion refinery in the country’s northeast Rust Belt.Beijing’s Xinjiang policy got a boost when the Saudi Crown Prince expressed support for China’s right to act against separatism and extremism"

A professor presents his perspective on the removal of the Gandhi statue from the campus of the University of Ghana: an issue of self-respect or ignorance?
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The controversy over the statue of Mahatma Gandhi on the campus of the University of Ghana was sad and surprising. The statue was inaugurated by former President Pranab Mukherjee two years ago as a symbol of ties between two nations. However, soon afterwards, a section of professors and students started a petition asking for its removal as they alleged that Gandhi was a racialist against black people and removal of his statue was an “issue of self-respect”. The agitation forced the University authorities to remove the statue from the campus.Now, firstly, Gandhi saying something as a young lawyer need not be considered as a part of his later ideology, when he became a public figure.Secondly, any word or term used by a public figure in the past, must be judged in the context in which it was said as well as in space and period when it was said. Some words and terms that were in vogue in the past, became derogatory afterwards. For example pan-African leader Du Bois, who organised five pan-African Conferences between two World Wars, asked for ‘complete political equality for ‘Negroes’! Marcus Garvey, a militant Jamaican who wanted to meet ‘white racialism with black racialism’ founded a ‘Negro’ Empire in New York in 1920. But today the use of the word ‘Negro’ is derogatory. Hence Gandhi using a particular word must be judged in context, before jumping to the conclusion that he was a racist against black people.There is also another misunderstanding about Gandhi’s work in South Africa. Even some reputed Indian intellectuals have criticised Gandhi for fighting only against the discriminatory treatment given to the people of Indian origin in South Africa and not local black Africans who were also discriminated against. On the face of it, the question seems to be very relevant, but if one looks at the history, the question becomes totally irrelevant. Firstly, Gandhi had asked for no new rights for himself or for the people of Indian origin in South Africa. He was only pleading with the government of South Africa not to discriminate against the people of Indian origin there. In fact, he was telling the government of South Africa to fulfill their obligation as a part of the British Empire.Before going to South Africa, Gandhi had spent three years in England for his education. In London, the seat of the Empire, he did not receive discriminatory treatment. Officially no Indian was supposed to be given such treatment in England. This was as per the Queen’s Declaration of 1858 issued after the revolt of 1857 when the British government took over the administration of India from the East India Company. The Queen’s Declaration had promised Indians equal treatment throughout the Empire. Since South Africa was a part of the British Empire, the same was expected from the government of South Africa. This is what Gandhi was asking and the reason he decided to launch the agitation. Since the Queen’s promise was applicable only to Indians and not to the Africans, there was no question of Gandhi fighting for the black people.Gandhi was a lawyer and he knew how far he could go. Had South Africa been a colony of any other European power, Gandhi would have no right to fight discrimination either against him or any other Indian. One hopes that Gandhi’s critics, henceforth at least will not use this issue to criticise Gandhi.Now coming to the present action of the professors and students of the University of Ghana, one can understand the new generation of Ghanaian professors and students have not read much on Mahatma Gandhi except for some archival piece on racialism. However, one at least expects them to be aware of the freedom struggle of their own country which was theoretically and practically launched and conducted strictly on Gandhian philosophy of peace and non-violence, in fact, in the name of Gandhi. Their nationalist leader Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first President after its independence, had first thought of the Gandhian method of non-violence as “utterly feeble” and “without hope of success” as a solution to the problem of colonialism. Kwame Nkrumah in his biography wrote, “How is it possible, I ask myself, for a revolution to succeed without arms and ammunition? After months of studying Gandhi’s policy and watching the effect, I began to see that when backed by a strong political organisation, it could be a solution to colonial problems”. This strong political organisation was the United Gold Coast (Ghana’s earlier name) Convention that Nkrumah established in 1947, with branches all over the country. He had translated Satyagraha into a programme of ‘positive action’, which he defined as “non-cooperation” based on the principle of “absolute non-violence as used by Gandhi in India”. The result was quick. Within ten years of its formation, Ghana became independent, the first black African country to throw away the yoke of colonialism. The Morning Telegraph of Accra even called Nkrumah the ‘Gandhi of Ghana’.With the resounding success of non-violence as a tactic and method for the struggle against colonialism, Nkrumah who at the first conference of independent African States held at Accra in April 1958, also insisted that future African struggle should be on Gandhian lines.However, when Algeria launched a violent struggle against France, under the pressure of President Nasser of Egypt, Nkrumah agreed to a resolution declaring, “Full support to all fighters in Africa, to all those who are compelled to retaliate against violence to attain national independence and freedom”. But even after that, Nkrumah continued to reiterate the principle of non-violence and declared that, “We decry violence and deplore it”. Such was Gandhi’s influence on Nkrumah and on the early African freedom movement.Nkrumah and some other African leaders paid tribute to Gandhi in terms of suggesting his Jesus-like influence on African and Asian nationalism. But Professor Ali Muzrui, a leading intellectual of our times, pointed out that, Gandhi was more than just the Jesus of African nationalism. In fact in some ways, he became almost an antidote to Jesus. This was because in Africa, Christianity came to be associated with colonialism whereas Gandhi’s influence was totally anti-colonial.If this Gandhi is racial to the professors and the students of the University of Ghana, then one can only say, Oh God! Forgive them, they do not know what they say and do!The writer is a former director of the Centre for African Studies, University of Mumbai. Views are personal."
‘The Great March of Democracy — Seven Decades of India’s Elections’ and ‘Every Vote Counts — The Story of India’s Elections’ reviews: Looking beyond numbers,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/the-great-march-of-democracy-seven-decades-of-indias-elections-and-every-vote-counts-the-story-of-indias-elections-reviews-looking-beyond-numbers/article26408211.ece,"
Two books on the election process and why Indian voters take it so seriously
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Elections have a lot to do with numbers, but they are not only about numbers. These two volumes, timed for the 17th general election of India that already gives us a sense of foreboding for the fractious social milieu in the country, prompt us to reflect and engage with India’s democratic process in an intimate and more responsible way. One is edited by S.Y. Quraishi and the other is written by Navin Chawla.Both were chief election commissioners (CEC) of India, both worked together as election commissioners and both have previous books that showed their remarkable ability of storytelling. They do not disappoint us in the latest offerings.Many facetsQuraishi’s edited volume is on a range of election-related topics randomly selected and has some unpredictable authors such as Ratan Tata and Naina Lal Kidwai alongside several well-known election experts like Ornit Shani, Gilles Verniers and Yogendra Yadav.Two politicians, the late Somnath Chatterjee, and Shashi Tharoor, also offer their unique perspectives. Collectively, these essays give us enticing glimpses of the many facets of Indian elections, including historical, legal and comparative. Milan Vaishnav’s essay on confronting the influence of money and Rahul Verma’s on the roll of opinion polls and electronic media deal with the challenges to the sanctity of the electoral process.A particularly outstanding piece in the collection is by Mukulika Banerjee on ‘why does India vote.’ Indian voters take the act of voting as sacrosanct and see it as an exercise of their equal status as citizens, her qualitative survey suggests. The act of voting itself is a form of empowerment for them.Yadav’s essay examines how the electorate negotiates its terms with the state through elections, and also some paradoxical features of Indian democracy, where popular aspirations are realised in very modest measure but the popular trust in the system continues.Voting patternsEvery Vote Countsis Chawla’s account from the CEC’s perch, but it is also laced with anecdotes and snippets from history, court judgments and engages with global concerns such as fake news and unregulated propaganda that threaten democracy. While the ECI has over the years worked hard to keep the integrity of the election process intact, accusations of tampering is as old as the elections themselves. One news report, without proof, said in 1952 the steel ballot boxes could be tampered without removing its seal! Incidentally, the maximum expenditure a candidate was allowed in a Lok Sabha constituency then was ₹7,000. Both Quraishi and Chawla make the point that the ECI was constituted a day before the Republic Day, in 1950 — a fact that underscores the criticality of free and fair elections in the sustenance and nourishment of a democracy. Chawla tells us about the lone voter in the Gir sanctuary for whom a booth is set up and an election party travels several kilometres, an election team that trekked 45 km up the Himalayas through snow for two days to reach a booth in 2009 in Jammu and Kashmir — all to ensure that the last woman in the periphery has a say in the affairs of this vast country, however imperfect it may be.A lot of Chawla’s recollections are from the 2009 Lok Sabha election when he was CEC, but a more evocative section in the current context is on the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly election of 2008. The author, who otherwise maintains a detached poise as he narrates moments that he is personally involved in, is passionate in his description of how he fought the then CEC N. Gopalaswamy to ensure that elections were held in time in the troubled State. The CEC was opposed to conducting the elections then. As it turns out, Chawla and Quraishi, both commissioners, pushed ahead with the elections amid turmoil. He also recounts in some detail how one of his predecessors J.M. Lyngdoh walked the extra mile in 2002 to restore the lost credibility and integrity of the election process in the State, which was one reason for Jammu and Kashmir’s aggravating alienation from the rest of India and militancy.In 2008, the ECI built on that to enhance the popular trust in the system. The line between democracy and majoritarianism is breached with violence and impunity these days. These books remind us why every vote must count.Every Vote Counts: The Story of India’s Elections; Navin Chawla, HarperCollins India, ₹699.The Great March of Democracy: Seven Decades of India’s Elections; Edited by S.Y.

The Congress also said that even if the NDA government tries to “gag the media or/and arrest every citizen” the party will not be deterred from speaking the “truth.”Rafale documents ‘stolen’ remark: How can this government defend country, ask Opposition partiesThe Opposition on Wednesday slammed the government over the Attorney General’s submission in the Supreme Court claiming that theRafale documents published inThe Hinduwere“stolen” from the Ministry of Defenceand questioned the government’s capability to defend the country.Poorest of poor and uneducated women left behind in ICDSAnganwadi services have a poor reach among key beneficiaries – the poorest of the poor and uneducated mothers – according to a paper published in a WHO bulletin recently. The government’s Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) provides a package of six services at anganwadi or child-care centres to youngchildrenand pregnant women and lactating mothers. These services include supplementary nutrition, referral services, immunisation, health check-up, pre-school non-formal education and health and nutrition education.Environment Ministry plugs loophole that allowed plastic waste importThe government has plugged a loophole that allowed the import of plastic waste into India for processing. “…Solid plastic waste has been prohibited from import into the country including in Special Economic Zones (SEZ) and by Export Oriented Units (EOU),” the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) said in an order made public on Wednesday. The change in law was part of the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Amendment Rules, 2019.ISRO, French space agency seal agreement on maritime securityNational space agency ISRO and its French counterpart CNES on Wednesday sealed an agreement to set up a joint maritime surveillance system in the country in May.

But these rare specimens are scattered in different labs all over the country. So, to better conserve this prehistoric heritage, the government is planning to house them in one place — an ‘Earth Museum’.Guard against misuse, social media platforms toldThe Parliamentary Panel on Information and Technology has directed Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram to ensure that their platforms are not used to incite violence or meddle in the Lok Sabha election. This is the third meeting of the panel with social media platforms. The last meeting was with Twitter officials.‘We don’t want to reopen old wounds,’ says SirisenaExposing the rift persisting within the Sri Lankan government, President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday said he would ask the UN Human Rights Council to reconsider its 2015 resolution on the country, as he did not wish to “reopen old wounds”.All England Badminton Championship: Hyun knocks out SindhuA profligate P V Sindhu was Wednesday knocked out of the All England Championship by an industrious Sung Ji Hyun of Korea in the women’s singles opening round. In men’s singles, 2017 Singapore Open champion B Sai Praneeth defeated compatriot HS Prannoy 21-19 21-19 in a pulsating contest.Editorial | Back to life: on the belated acquittal of death row convictsIt is a tale of Kafkaesque horror.Six members of a nomadic tribe spent 16 years in prison in Maharashtra; three of them were on death row for 13 of these years, while the other three faced the gallows for nearly a decade. One of them was a juvenile at the time of the offence. And all this for a crime they did not commit. The only silver lining for the six convicts is that even though 10 years had elapsed since the Supreme Court imposed the death penalty on them, the sentence was not carried out."

It is dangerous and aimed at destroying scheme: Vasuki
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s suggestion that the noon meal scheme be handed over to Akshya Patra Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, will lead to privatisation of the social welfare scheme, according to All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA).The Governor’s suggestion, which came at the launch of aKaalai unavu thittam(breakfast scheme) in a Corporation school in Chennai recently, was ‘very dangerous’ and aimed at destroying the government’s scheme, AIDWA national vice-president U. Vasuki said on Thursday.Briefing reporters on the deliberations of a two-day AIDWA State committee meeting here, she said the State government should ignore the Governor’s suggestion and continue to implement the scheme. There were reports of irregularities against the NGO, which was serving noon meal in some other States, she alleged.Mr. Purohit’s remarks in favour of the NGO was also aimed at promoting vegetarianism as the organisation did not serve eggs to school children in other States. “This is an attempt to thrust vegetarianism on school children”, she said. “We all know as how beef eating is being politicised in the country.”Referring to the controversy over the Centre’s announcement of board examinations for class V and VIII students, Ms. Vasuki urged the School Education department in the State to issue communication declaring that there would no such examination for the children in Tamil Nadu. School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan had merely stated that there would be no board examinations this year, she said.The State Commission for Women and the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights should be more assertive in protecting the rights of women and children, who were increasingly vulnerable to abuse, violence and harassment.As they were statutory bodies they should have their say in drawing policies, she added."

Abhishek Chaubey’s Sonchiriya powerfully entwines multiple strands – patriarchy, masculinity, gender and caste – in a film about seething rebellions
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"No two films could be as different from each other as Madhu C. Narayanan’sKumbalangi Nightsand Abhishek Chaubey’sSonchiriya. One set in the Kerala of today, other in the 70s Chambal where gangs of with dacoits are fighting among themselves, even while taking on the cops. Yet they stand on a similar ground when it comes to their women: In Narayanan’s film the female characters are on the fringes of the narrative, in Chaubey’s there are barely any women visible in the entire scenario.Yet, in both films, women are the pivots on which the explorations of patriarchy, masculinity, gender and caste (in the case ofSonchiriya) exploitation, swivel and spin.Chambal, is all about suffocation and victimisation when it comes to being a woman and are no more than pieces of meat for male consumption, or markers of male honour. Gender meets caste inSonchiriya, and it gets that much more complicated. Protection and respect are earned if the woman is of the same social stature.Beyond that, no voice, identity or worldview can be allowed. Women have absolutely nowhere to run and hide at the bottom of the caste ladder — you are destined to be used, abused, and violated in unimaginable ways.Yet rebellion seethes silently behind theghoonghats(veils), and seeks basic human dignity and the right to live. Violence is their recourse when denied fundamentals.Sonchiriyapresents the smothering of women searingly. Women are a separate caste, the lowest of them all, it asserts.Patriarchy doesn’t just claim women as victims, it also affects men, driving their misplaced notions of masculinity inherited over generations; it emasculates one son and sets off another against his own mother.The intricate script strings many themes together with hardly a note out of place. With self-assurance, almost every sequence tingles with latent, troubling energy.The film is an insight into the life of the band of brothers — their bonds, emotions, and loyalties.; their beliefs, practices, and superstitions; their allegiance tobaaghi ka dharmathe rebel’s defined way of life, yet the dilemmas of this pride making way for a sense of shame. Will surrender lead to better days?You end up feeling one with thebaaghis. The brutal are humane in the oddest of ways, especially in following their unwritten codes of honour, seeking salvation even in death. On the other hand, the police aims to clean up Chambal — at times for personal reasons. There’s a thin line dividing revenge from justice.Every actor in this multi-starrer their all to the character. A special word for Bhumi Pednekar who is emerging as Bollywood’s every-woman from any part of the country. Ranvir Shorey finally gets a role he deserves, underlying the ruthlessness of his character with a rare pathos and poignancy.Sonchiriyastarts off with a corpse, and death ominously stalks almost each and of its frames — it’s in the sound of the bullets, spurting of the blood, and in the fabulously mounted encounters.Sonchiriyais a rare bird, the metaphorical redemption that everyone is seeking.Apni apni Sonchiriya, apni apni mukti. It’s ultimately a journey towards finding your own bird of salvation.Chaubey evokes the sense of place by going beyond the arid, stark, larger-than-life landscape — he turns it into a character in itself. It’s seeped in the Bundelkhandi, the dacoit-speak, the risque and raw humour. It’s in the way they dress. It’s in their body language, in their culture. It’s in the most minut of details — whether it’s the reference to the guns of the 1962 war or the Special Task Force, the morning cackling of AIR, or Indira Gandhi’s announcement of the Emergency.Then there are political potshots that lift it from its specific location and period, to give it a larger universality. It’s like one of the rebels talking about how no one dies from the bullet of the government but by its [false] promises. Hear hear!"

Artists across the country are coming together to offer a message of peace
",,"This weekend, India’s arts and culture community is raising a collective hand of protestA series of hate crimes, allegedly by Hindutva-related right-wing elements against minorities, led to protests in different cities across India last year, under the broad umbrella of #NotInMyName. Many of the people leading or participating in these protests happened to be from the arts community, and over 2018, their conversations continued, as their worries about polarisation in the country increased.Around September 2018, the murmur of worry coalesced into a loose collective, Artists Unite!, to discuss ways of acting against what seemed to be escalating efforts to create an atmosphere of hate and the taking over of cultural institutions.No to assaultDelhi-based filmmaker Saba Dewan, a member of the collective, says, “We felt that given the kind of assault we are witnessing against culture, the way culture is being reduced to one colour, we should be protesting. And that the way we should protest should be by using our cultural practices.” Over the next few months, cultural practitioners across the country joined in, discussing the form their protests should take.The group issued a declaration in early December (it has over 700 signatures) that concluded with the resolution to defend the plurality of the country by countering hate with love, violence with peace, “through our images, speech, words, music and bodies”.Those protests are taking place on March 2 and 3, in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar, Pune, Ahmedabad, Nagpur, Dharwad, Chandigarh, Indore, Jamshedpur and a few other cities.Two cities will witness multi-disciplinary and multiple stage events at a single venue: the 15 August Park in Red Fort in Delhi, and the Visthar campus, Bengaluru. In Mumbai on March 2, there will be a ‘participatory performance parade’ from Chaityabhoomi, Dadar, to the Carter Road seaface. Chennai will see a film festival in Panuval bookstore and an ‘inclusive playground’ at Santhome.Artists Unite! says that there is no attempt to curate things: creative people have come forward with their ideas, and resources like artworks are shared, but events are self-organised in each location.For more details on the events, visitfacebook.com/artistsuniteindiaWill defend the plurality of our country through our images, speech, words, music and bodiesDeclaration by Artists Unite!"
'Appeal for Reason' from over 600 concerned citizens on Indo-Pak tension,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/appeal-for-reason-from-over-600-concerned-citizens-on-indo-pak-tension/article26410066.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Further to the recent tensions between India and Pakistan, an appeal was released on Friday on behalf of more than 600 Indian signatories from different walks of life - students, teachers, economists, journalists, lawyers, industrialists, writers, actors, choreographers, photographers, physicists, homemakers, retired bureaucrats, diplomats, judges, the armed forces. The endorsements were received within 24 hours of the appeal being circulated by email by an initial group of 28 signatories.The appeal for reason is below:We, citizens of India, are deeply concerned at the recent escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan, and at the climate of intolerance that is developing around it.Nothing can justify the act of terrorism that took the lives of more than 40 CRPF personnel in Pulwama on 14 February 2019. Nor can anything justify the Pakistan government’s covert support of armed groups that have carried out this sort of attack in Kashmir over the years.Nevertheless, India’s response to this incident must abide by international law in letter and spirit. It must also be responsible and take into account the risks involved in an armed conflict between two nuclear powers.The history of war across the world has repeatedly shown how easily and speedily an armed conflict can escalate well beyond what was initially expected. The first World War, we may recall, began with a single assassination, which set in motion a chain of attacks and counter-attacks that eventually led to millions of casualties. Similarly, it would be easy for seemingly “safe” strikes and counter-strikes between India and Pakistan to lead to a major confrontation, possibly even nuclear war, with disastrous consequences for both sides.Even a limited confrontation would resolve nothing – neither the tensions between India and Pakistan, nor the Kashmir dispute. On the contrary, it would aggravate tensions and delay the process of conflict resolution.The principal victims of this conflict are the civilian residents of Kashmir, who have endured immense suffering over the years, including gross human rights violations. In recent days, Kashmiris have also been a target of brutal attacks across the country. If the conflict intensifies, this hostility is likely to be extended to other minorities and dissidents.The victims also include hundreds of thousands of military and para-military personnel, largely drawn from underprivileged groups, who are exposed to the most trying service conditions in Kashmir and may soon be exposed to further danger.The victims of continued hostility also include the Indian population at large, in so far as it absorbs valuable financial and human resources that could be used for better purposes. Perhaps the biggest national damage is the erosion of democracy including the freedom of expression and dissent.Unfortunately, the climate of jingoism that tends to develop around this sort of situation is obscuring these simple truths. Even reasoned demands for a peaceful solution tend to be conflated with anti-national sentiment.We appeal to the governments on both sides to refrain from further hostilities, overt or covert, and to resolve their differences within the framework of international law and human rights.The full list of signatories, as of 1 March morning, is below.1A P Shah [Former Chief Justice, Delhi High Court]2A.

At least two soldiers were carried away from the hotel on Friday morning.The attack - the latest in a series of high-profile assaults in East Africa by al Shabaab - came after U.S. forces in Somalia stepped up air strikes against the Islamist group.“The militants are still fighting from inside a civilian house adjacent to the hotel... [They] are fighting back with grenades and Kalashnikov [rifles],” police officer Major Musa Ali told Reuters.He said 29 people, mostly civilians, had died in the attack and its aftermath, and 80 had been wounded. Many civilians had been rescued but the death toll could rise, he added.Al Shabaab's military spokesman said the group was still in control of the Hotel Maka Al-Mukarama, which is used by government officials and located on a street lined with hotels, shops and restaurants.“The government tried three times to enter the building but we repulsed them,” said Abdiasis Abu Musab.Somalia has been convulsed by lawlessness and violence since 1991, and al Shabaab is fighting to dislodge a Western-backed government protected by African Union-mandated peacekeepers.The group has also carried out deadly attacks in neighbouring countries contributing to the African Union force, including one on a hotel and office complex in Kenya in January that killed 21 people.Under President Donald Trump, Washington has stepped up attacks against the group, and U.S. Africa Command announced six air strikes it says have killed 52 militants since Feb. 23.In Mogadishu, a Reuters photographer saw frantic residents in the city searching for missing relatives through the night, making countless phone calls to find out if anyone had seen their family members.“I have been running to and fro from blast scene to hospitals since yesterday evening in search of my husband and brother ...I have just seen them in hospital, they are in critical condition. My husband lost his stomach and my brother suffered severe wounds to both arms,” Halima Omar, a mother of three children, told Reuters.In northern Somalia, a splinter group of former al Shabaab fighters who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State is also battling the insurgency.At least 25 people have been killed in the fighting between the two sides this week when al Shabaab captured three villages from the faction aligned to Islamic State, a military official from the semi-autonomous region of Puntland told Reuters."

Finds out that chargesheet filed only in 5,573 cases out of 15,698
",,"The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on Saturday issued notices to the Delhi Police over high pendency of cases involving domestic violence. The commission said following complaints received during the ongoing ‘Mahila Suraksha Padyatra’, notices were issued to all DCPs across the Capital, seeking information pertaining to the investigation in the respective cases.The DCW said, “The commission is shocked to learn that out of 15,698 cases [since 2012] in which FIR has been registered, chargesheet has been filed only in 5,573.”“In Paschim Vihar and Khyala, several women complained about the rising instances of domestic violence and dowry. A common problem was that there was no support from the police in such cases,” said a DCW official.While asking the force to respond by March 12, the DCW said, “Please provide details of the case, steps undertaken to sensitize police force in general and investigation officers. Please provide a detailed proposal for ensuring that investigation in cases of domestic violence is fast tracked and these cases are dealt in a sensitive manner.”"

A two-volume book on Kunwar Narayan acquaints us with the various and equally powerful layers of the creative prowess of the celebrated poet
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"At a time when the obliteration of forbearance, truth, diversity, equality and justice is looked up with reverent awe across the globe and the ascending waves of hatred and disguised religious belligerence are set to gain control over us, what can trigger an intellectually stimulating narrative of mutual understanding? It is none other than the poetry that can still produce a consciousness against animosity, dominance, falsehood, deceit and exploitation and it is the recurring theme of decently textured and nuanced poetry of Kunwar Narayan, the widely acclaimed poet of modern Hindi poetry. The importance of Kunwar Narayan, who discovers new frontier of diversity when plurality is being replaced by a cacophonous discourse of uniformity, is astutely highlighted by the eminent Hindi poet and critic Om Nishchal in his brilliantly written introduction that appears in a two-volume book on Kunwar Narayan titled as “Anway” and “Anvati”, recently published by Raj Kamal Prakashan.The volumes, edited with a marked sense of critical acuity goes beyond the configuration of festschrift and Om Nishchal selected the focused and perceptive articles that acquaint us with the various and equally powerful layers of creative prowess of Kunwar Narayan who emerged as a literary, cultural and cerebral phenomenon of the contemporary India. Can poetry bring forth a new meaning in the melee of voices of meaningless and according to Kunwar Narayan poetry, rooted in our life and language, closely resembles with a fire bird (phoenix) that burns itself and then is born time and again from its ashes. Similarly, poetry symbolises the eternity of life. In his poem, “The need of poetry”, Kunwar evocatively argues: “Poetry can give us much more/ In that poetry can play multiple roles/ If we provide space to it in life/ The way tree embraces flowers or night greets stars”.Moral sustenanceAnother celebrated Hindi poet, Ashok Vajpeyi endorses Kunwar Narayan and for him poetry provides moral sustenance and it constructs a site of identity, self assertion, self exploration, interrogation and conscience. “Poetry remains a trinity of conscience, courage and truth. It is interminably satyagrah against uniformity and totalisation. It is a site where there are no others.”Om NischalOm Nishchal in his insightful introduction, “Kavita Mein Kunwar Narayan”, makes the whole corpus of Kunar Narayan’s writing an object of a single pristine look and points out that his poetry zeroes in on the contradictions and dichotomies of life and produces a layered narrative that strikingly unravels new terrains of human predicament. His poem, “The Trial” explains how violence is perpetuated through law and how justice, punishment and exoneration become unavailing and villainous: “Those who were awarded death penalty, died long ago/ Those set free, already completed their term.” It is Kafkaesque rendering that casts a spell on the readers.The glitz and tantalising sway of the ever expanding market that almost converted every house into a shopping site infuriates Kunwar Narayan and his piercing perception projects an alternative view of the world around him. “Market is the place where I always found/ A lingering solitariness that I cannot experience even in dense and sprawling forests/ It fills me with the delight that Socrates felt while saying, ‘I do not require these so many things’”.Om Nishchal’s critical insight prompts him to engage Manglesh Dabral who wipes out the aura of possession and plentifulness: What will I do with innumerable footwear/ I find it difficult to keep a pair of shoes properly/ How will I handle so many rooms/ This world is a home, not a hotel and the bowl of my sleep hardly exceeds the size of a bird.”Om Nishchal pertinently observes that only a poet can treat the most powerful signifier of our times – Market, with utter disdain. The poet is convinced that no machine or instrument can measure the pain which does not stick to reason, it has its own reason which is not visible. ECG is destined to draw a blank if it is put to use. “The machine cannot understand the language of pain/ It is made up of anguish.”The author pointed out that the diaries of the poet are replete with such trenchant comments: “What constitutes the language of love? If we put together nearly effaced words and inaudible voices, then the language of love could emerge. Love is the greatest reality and the biggest dream”.The editor, Om Nishchal really took pains in highlighting the multifaceted personality of Kunwar Narayan whose creative dexterity is not confined to just one literary genre – poetry. He wrote criticism, short stories and diaries with a marked sense of individuality. His writings turn attention to myriad conditions of angst, despair, hope and aspiration and his engagement with the contemporary life enables him to denounce all kinds of enslavement and inequality and he is against all that causes major upheaval across the globe.The first volume, comprising 413 pages, carries sensitively rendered and perceptive articles of many stalwarts of Indian writings such as Sitakant Mahapatra, Harish Trivedi, Ashok Vajpeyi, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Mrinal Pande, Mudra Rakshas, Leeladhar Jagudi and many promising authors and poets, and critics Pankaj Parashar, Anamika, Rajesh Joshi, Vijay Kumar, Sanjay Roy, Pankaj Bose and Vimlesh Tripathi, etc.The second volume, titled as ‘Anvati’, running into 516 pages, showcases the oeuvre of Kunwar Narayan with remarkable critical disposition and his seminal contribution to the Indian literature is cogently documented. A number of eminent critics and poets – Parmanand Srivastava, Leeladhar Mandloi, Vishnu Khare, Nand Kishore Naval, K. Satchidanandan, Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari, Dinesh Kumar Shukla, Pankaj Chaturvedi, Vishwanath Tripathi, Rekha Sethi and the like candidly delineate the enduring relevance of Kunwar Narayan. Two volumes bear an eloquent testimony to critical alertness of Om Nishchal and he deserves accolades ."
"Bengal’s film industry might have a crush on Didi, but Anik Dutta’s cinema has been consistently political",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bengals-film-industry-might-have-a-crush-on-didi-but-anik-duttas-cinema-has-been-consistently-political/article26408410.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When Anik Dutta’s first filmBhooter Bhabishyat(2012), made on a budget of ₹60 lakh, (officially) earned ₹3 crore, it surprised everyone, including Dutta. It was arguably the biggest hit in the Bengali film industry, made by a man who had been trying to make a film for 20 years and failing.In the film, the plan to tear down an elegant old house and build a jazzy mall threatens the ghosts who live there. They refuse to live in a shiny new place, unlike the more accommodating ghosts in some recent Hindi films. As ever, Bengalis have to be difficult. The intimidation crew tasked to secure the property is made up of goondas on political party rolls, a direct pointer to cadres of the Left Front party (who’ve since been signed up by Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress).More than anything, the film was a cheerful political satire in the tradition of Satyajit Ray’sGoopy Gyne Bagha Byne(1969) andHirak Rajar Deshe(1980). The industry had seen a renewal in the 90s with the intimate and prolific work of the late Rituparno Ghosh. But Ghosh worked in the domain of gender and sexual politics, his films didn’t explorepoliticspolitics. Besides, Bengalis have a talent formon-kharap— melancholia — and the work of the most celebrated filmmakers, from Ritwik Ghatak to Rituparno Ghosh, even the later films of Ray and Mrinal Sen, is suffused with brooding. This is not to say their films are not funny or don’t contain joy, but the overall aura is bleak. In contrast, Dutta, an adman with an affinity for punning, brought to his film something akin to glee. The ghosts win, of course, and so the ulcerous reality of the real estate mafia, their toxic nexus with political parties, the citizens’ powerlessness, feels laughable for a moment.That was 2012. The previous year, Mamata Banerjee had defeated the Left Front that had governed West Bengal for 34 years straight. It was the year Sujoy Ghosh’sKahaanimade Kolkata look like never before — an enigmatic, energetic city where insurance salesmen who don’t meet their sales targets make sure to hit their assassination targets. And a sharp political film likeBhooter Bhabishyatwas among the biggest hits that year. Somehow, Kolkata felt full of possibility.A still from Anik Dutta’s first film ‘Bhooter Bhabishyat’ (2012).In 2013, news broke of the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams. Millions of poor, small investors were cheated of their savings. The Saradha group had a finger in every pie, including media, film production and real estate. And these media houses unambiguously supported the Trinamool. In his next film,Aschorjyo Prodeep(2013), Dutta showed a Kolkata full of jazzy gated colonies, shiny restaurants, lounges and salons. Exactly the sort of ‘development’ the Trinamool had been promising. I don’t know if it was intentional, but the production design of the film was tacky — like the Big Ben replica that’s been constructed in the heart of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. At one point in the film, the hero says: “What’s the point of going to London? London is here!” It was a direct dig at the Chief Minister, who had said a number of times that Kolkata would become London.It’s not thatporiborton(change) has not happened. Something does feel different about Kolkata now, and not all of it is bad. This is not the space to talk about other policies, but one of the visible changes is in the Bengali entertainment industry, which now has a confidence that was not there even when Ghosh got Bollywood stars like Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan to shoot Bengali films in Kolkata. The number of film and TV hoardings in the city have noticeably grown in the past eight years or so.The industry enjoys a close relationship with the Chief Minister. Of the 34 Trinamool MPs in the Lok Sabha, five are actors (Moon Moon Sen, Dev, Satabdi Roy, Sandhya Roy and Tapas Pal). The BJP, with 268 MPs, has seven actors. In 2014, Bengali superstar Dev accompanied the Chief Minister’s delegation on her maiden trip abroad (to Singapore). The Chief Minister’s campaign trail sometimes has filmstars making cameo appearances. At a rally in Murshidabad in 2014, the sisters Riya and Raima Sen popped out of Didi’s helicopter to speak for 45 seconds; 45 seconds of English with a couple of Bengali words thrown in. In September 2018, journalist Indranil Roy pointed to the similarity between Dev’s new filmHoichoi Unlimitedand a Pakistani film, and was picked up by the Kolkata police for questioning.A still from ‘Aschorjyo Prodeep’ (2013).The closeness between the Trinamool and Tollywood, as Kolkata’s film industry is called, has not resulted in direct propaganda films of the sort Bollywood has made. So far, there’s been no film on Kanyashree, the government’s award-winning girl child education scheme, like the Bollywood films on Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. Nor a biopic yet on the Chief Minister. Tollywood has instead made interesting, even aesthetic films, on transgender lives (Nagarkirtan, 2019,Chitrangada, 2012), handsome period pieces (Ek Je Chhilo Raja, 2018), detective stories, and films on Muslim marginalisation and crime networks (Zulfiqar, 2016), but has steered clear of present-day politics.Dutta’s third filmMeghnadbodh Rohoshyo(2017), a beautifully-made thriller, is also political. It confronts the complicit silence of the Bengali middle and upper-middle class to the brutal State suppression of the Naxalite movement in the 70s. Films (including those of Ray and Mrinal Sen) and novels have chronicled the romance and restlessness of those years and the tyranny unleashed by the Congress government. What they haven’t spoken of is the disowning of the Naxalites by their own friends and family. Only Mahasweta Devi’sHajaar Churashir Maa(1974) addressed this guilt. Jhumpa Lahiri’s novelThe Lowland(2013) and Dutta’sMeghnadbodh Rohoshyoare a part of this delayed reckoning.Dutta is a straight talker. At the Kolkata International Film Festival last year, he was a speaker on a panel about filmmaking. When asked whether the director was more important or the producer, Dutta said the Chief Minister was the most important, given the number of her photographs on the festival promotional material. “Right then, I knew this guy would get into trouble,” said filmmaker Judhajit Sarkar.Bhobishyoter Bhoot, Dutta’s fourth film, which was taken off theatres last month, is a political satire that indicts all political parties equally. It is believed to have reserved its sharpest barbs for the ‘Chhinnomool Party’. On February 11, one of its producers received a letter from the Kolkata Police’s intelligence branch requesting a private screening because the police had “received inputs” that the film contained elements that may incite “public sentiments”. On February 16, the film quietly and suddenly stopped playing in theatres after running for just a day. UnlikePadmaavat(2018), whose release Chief Minister Banerjee supported, there was no violence around this film, no noise, no threats. Only silence.The writer is an independent journalist based in Kolkata. Twitter: @sohinichat"

Yeddyurappa’s remarks that the heightened tension on the India-Pakistan border could benefit the party at the polls exposed their evil designs.Poll rally“At a time when the Congress chose to postpone its working committee meet and rally in Ahmedabad, the Prime Minister went ahead addressing BJP cadres as part of the party’s poll campaign. It is rather painful that he considers politics over national security,” he said.Mr. Chandy accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of continuing to resort to the politics of violence.“Despite coming into power, the party has failed to shed its style of politics that sought to eliminate political rivals. Of the 20 political murders reported in the State since the Left Democratic Front came into power, 16 were the handiwork of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), with the BJP and Social Democratic Party of India committing two each. On the other hand, the Congress has always stuck to its avowed stance of democratic politics,” he said.Delivering the introductory address, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala accused the State government of neglecting the welfare of farmers in Kerala.Farmer deaths“As many as eight farmers have committed suicide in Idukki this year. Mere assurances of declaring a moratorium on repayment of loans will not serve as a permanent solution to the crisis. The government must learn from the decisions of the Congress-led governments in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and decide to waive farm loans. Instead, the government has chosen to spend ₹9.5 crore for the celebrations being organised to mark its 1,000 days in power,” he said.KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran; Shashi Tharoor, MP; KPCC working president Kodikunnil Suresh, MP; K.

Manjula Padmanbhan’s Lights Out exposes the hypocrisy of the middle-class in their view on violence against women
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Bhasker walks in to find his wife Leela distressed by the screams of women that occur everyday in the next building. Bhasker tries to calm her down, but Leela is convinced that there is something more sinister to these events. As they discuss the cause for these disturbing occurrences, Mohan, Bhasker’s friend, makes an entry.The flamboyant Mohan, in a self-important manner, attempts an ‘analysis’ of the events in a discussion over drinks with Bhasker. While the conversation devolves from the inane to the ridiculous, it clearly reveals the patriarchal mindset regarding violence against women. This is the story of Manjula Padmanabhan’sLights Out,whichwas staged by Tanariri Theatres at Ranga Shankara. The play is based on a real life incident in the 1980s of crime against women, which were regular occurrences in a neighbourhood in Mumbai. This is where people despite witnessing the event did nothing about it.Lights Out,directed by Pranav Patadiya,had the audience riveted to their seats. The action was taut and fast-paced.The play never descended into insensitivity or melodrama. It got the audience thinking, on voyeurism and lack of empathy towards heinous crimes; on the attitude on the privileged with issues that don’t affect them directly. It gave an insight into society’s concern of an issue, but only when it came to offering a viewpoint, not when it came to taking action.The cast and crew of Tanariri deeply engaged with the play. The performances by Neeraja Rajeev, Rashmi Ravishankar, Shakti, Shruti Havale, Shubhra, Suranjay Patil and Pranav were impactful. Even though the character Frieda, the maid, had no dialogues, and was relegated to the background, her performance was outstanding.Special mention must be made of the sets, which were well-thought out. The stage management was neat and the direction by Pranav brought out the essence of the play quite effectively. In sum,Lights Outwas a sincere attempt."

Abrupt postponement, chaos at polling stations and violence, all contributed to the lowest ever general election turnout
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Nigeria has just had its general election, its sixth since its return to democracy. Incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) defeated his closest rival, Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), by about four million votes. Despite pre-election promises of accepting the result, Mr. Abubakar has rejected the results, calling the election a “sham” and “militarised” and deciding to question it in court. There were 73 registered candidates in the fray. There are 91 registered political parties.Election dataWith a population of nearly 200 million, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, accounting for 47% of west Africa’s population. It comprises more than 300 ethnic groups. The numbers of Muslims and Christians are almost equal though the first seem to be politically dominant. Although 82.3 million voters were registered and their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) made, 11.2 million were not collected, denying over 13% of all registered voters an opportunity to vote. Though the observer missions found the register of voters to be generally robust, I feel the figure of 41% registered voters to be disproportionate to the total population. In India, nearly 62% of the population is registered as voters.Unlike India, counting is done in the polling stations but the results are collated and declared at collation centres. It took seven days to announce the results of the presidential election while the collation of National Assembly elections is still going on.A federal republic with a presidential form of government, Nigeria has a bicameral National Assembly comprising the 109-member Senate and 360-member House of Representatives, both elected for four years. The country has 36 states (besides the Federal Capital Territory), each with an elected governor and a legislative assembly.It is Africa’s biggest oil exporter and has the largest natural gas reserves in the continent. Yet it ranks near the bottom of UNDP’s Human Development Report, 2017, ranking 157 in 189 countries.The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has enormous power and independence and is considered to be neutral and credible. Each state has a resident electoral commissioner, all appointed through a process of parliamentary ratification. When asked what his most important concerns were, INEC Chairman Mahmood Yakubu had mentioned security, fake news and hate speech, followed by 640 pending court cases and expenditure control.Gaps in this pollDespite the experience of two good elections of 2011 and 2015 and assurances given by the INEC, the management of elections was fraught with all kinds of flaws. First, there was the last-minute postponement of the poll by a week, just six hours before its commencement, because of the collapse of logistics. This created extreme anger across the nation apart from causing enormous economic loss (estimated at $10-25 billion). Then, despite the week’s deferment, there were delays not only in the distribution of materials but also late arrival of polling staff, causing a late opening of polling stations. This in turn led to many procedures not being adhered to. Voting booths were often located too close to polling officials, polling agents and voters waiting to vote, potentially compromising the secrecy of the ballot.The elections were also marred by sporadic incidents of violence before and on election day, besides destruction of voting materials, ballot-box snatching and bribing of voters. At least 39 people were killed in election-related violence. However, the death toll this time has been lower than in previous national elections.Abrupt postponement, delays and chaos at polling stations and the violence, all contributed to the lowest ever turnout — 35.6%, down from 44% in 2015. In Lagos, there were only 1.1 million valid votes (just above 5% voted. Further, polling officials, security staff and other essential services personnel were unable to vote and were, therefore, deprived of their vote. There was also widespread failure of smart card readers as polling officials awaited technical assistance or replacements, compounding the problems.Despite the complaints of ‘militarisation’, police presence was generally discreet and helpful to the electoral process. A coalition of more than 70 civic organisations monitored the elections, which enhanced the credibility of the elections.Connecting with IndiaNigeria is of great interest to India, being its biggest trading partner. Over 135 Indian companies have a footprint in Nigeria, including the State Bank of India, New India Assurance and Mecon in the public sector and Bharti Airtel, Tata, Bajaj, Birla, Kirloskar and Mahindra in the private sector. The number of Indians is relatively small — about 50,000. Though we have substantial economic interests, there are no political favourites. But as the world’s largest democracy, India has great interest in the success of the largest democracy of Africa. While the election commissions of the two countries have regular interactions and many officials have visited the flagship institution, the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management, there is need for enhanced engagement.S.Y.

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A UN probe on Thursday said there is evidence that Israel committed crimes against humanity in responding to last year’s protests in Gaza, as snipers targeted people clearly identifiable as children, health workers and journalists.Israel immediately rejected the findings as “hostile, deceitful and biased.”The UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on the protests in the Occupied Palestinian Territory investigated violations committed during demonstrations in the Gaza strip between March 30 and December 31 of 2018.“Israeli soldiers committed violations of international human rights and humanitarian law,” committee chair Santiago Canton said in a statement.“Some of those violations may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity,” he added.‘Snipers involved’The commission, set up by the UN Human Rights Council in May, said that “more than 6,000 unarmed demonstrators were shot by military snipers” during weeks of protest.“The Commission found reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers shot at journalists, health workers, children and persons with disabilities, knowing they were clearly recognisable as such,” it said.Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the report “hostile, deceitful and biased,” labelling it “the theatre of the absurd.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “rejects outright the report”.“The council sets new records of hypocrisy and lies, out of obsessive hatred of Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East,” Mr. Netanyahu said on Twitter.‘No imminent threat’Among the most contentious questions surrounding the Gaza protests was whether the Palestinian protesters posed a grave threat to Israeli troops.The UN investigators stressed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli troops killed and injured Palestinians “who were neither directly participating in hostilities, nor posing an imminent threat.”The commission also dismissed claims by Israel that the protests were aimed to conceal acts of terrorism. “The demonstrations were civilian in nature,” it said. “Despite some acts of significant violence, the Commission found that the demonstrations did not constitute combat or military campaigns.”At least 251 Palestinians have been killed since March 2018, the majority shot during border protests and others hit by tank fire or air strikes in response to violence from Gaza. Two Israeli soldiers have been killed over the same period."
"Why did Marathas not agitate for quota in the past, asks HC",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/why-did-marathas-not-agitate-for-quota-in-the-past-asks-hc/article26404132.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Bombay High Court asked the Maharashtra government on Thursday what prompted the Maratha community to agitate for reservation only in the recent past.A Division Bench of Justices Ranjit More and Bharati Dangre was hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the State government’s decision to grant 16% reservation to the community in government jobs and educational institutions. The demand for Maratha reservation was not raised after the Mandal Commission submitted its report in 1980, or when the State Backward Classes Commission submitted their reports, the court observed.“What was the sudden change in scenario in the recent past that prompted the State government to seek data on the condition of the Maratha community?” Justice Dangre asked.“After the Mandal commission report, there was no violence or agitation by the community demanding reservation. What happened suddenly that prompted such protests?” she said.The State government’s lawyer V.A. Thorat said the community was realising only now that it was being neglected. “The previous governments, whom the Maratha community was voting for, made the community think and live under the perception that they were forward. But now as time passed by, the community has started feeling that they are backward and need protection,” he said. “We are only correcting the mistakes committed in the past,” Thorat added.The Mandal Commission’s findings on socially and educationally backward classes, submitted in 1980, were valid only for two decades, he said.“Hence in 2014, the State government felt the need to get quantifiable data on the condition of the Maratha community. This is why the State Backward Classes Commission was set up,” Mr. Thorat said.If required, the government may also include other communities in the socially and educationally backward class in the future, the government lawyer added.The SBCC was set up as the National Commission for Backward Classes had not carried out any survey in Maharashtra before concluding that the Maratha community was “forward”, Mr. Thorat said.He also argued that under the Constitution, no court can inquire into the proceedings of a legislature.“Article 212 prohibits the judiciary from going into the procedure followed by the government while formulating an Act. The judiciary can inquire and ensure that the Act does not violate any law,” Mr. Thorat pointed out."

Abhishek Chaubey’s Sonichirya powerfully entwines multiple strands – patriarchy, masculinity, gender and caste – in a film about seething rebellions
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"No two films could be as different from each other as Madhu C. Narayanan’sKumbalangi Nightsand Abhishek Chaubey’sSonchiriya. One set in the Kerala of today, other in the 70s Chambal where gangs of dacoits are fighting among themselves, even while taking on the cops. Yet they stand on a similar ground when it comes to their women. In Narayanan’s film the female characters are on the fringes of the narrative, in Chaubey’s there are barely any women visible in the entire scenario. Yet, women are the pivots in both the films, on which the explorations of patriarchy, masculinity, gender and caste (in the case ofSonchiriya) exploitation swivel and spin.Chambal is all about suffocation and victimisation when it comes to being a woman. It’s where you are no more than a piece of meat for male consumption or a marker of the male honour. Gender meets caste inSonchiriya, and it gets that much more complicated. So, protection and respect are earned if the woman is of the same social stature. Beyond that no voice, identity or worldview can be allowed. And you have absolutely nowhere to run and hide if you are a woman at the bottom of the caste ladder; you are destined to be used, abused and violated in unimaginable ways.Yet rebellion seethes silently behind theghoonghats(veils) and boils over to seek basic human dignity and the right to live. Violence is the recourse opted for when the very fundamentals are denied. Sonchiriyapresents the smothering of women searingly. Women are a separate caste, the lowest of them all, asserts the film. But patriarchy doesn’t just claim women as victims, it also affects men as much, driving their misplaced notions of masculinity inherited over several generations; it can emasculate one son and set off another against his own mother.It’s an intricately woven script which strings many threads and themes together—crisply, economically with hardly a note out of place. The sure-footedness, self-assurance all adding to a deadly impact. Almost every scene and sequence tingles with latent, troubling energy. It’s an insight into the life of the band of brothers – their bonds, emotions and loyalties. The mourning for a leader gone yet the infighting because of a difference in principles. Their beliefs, practices, customs and superstitions. Their allegiance to “baaghi ka dharma”, the defined way of life of a rebel yet the dilemmas—how the pride in being a bandit is making way for a sense of shame. Will surrender lead to better days? Will there be mutton and kheer in the prison cell? It’s thebaaghisor the rebels you end up feeling one with. The brutal are humane in the oddest of ways, especially in following the unwritten codes of honour. Haunted by crimes gone wrong, bearing the burden of a hidden guilt that they want to let go of, seeking salvation at any cost, even in death. On the other hand is the police aiming to clean up Chambal – at times for personal reasons – there’s a thin line dividing revenge from justice.Every actor in the multi-starrer gives his or her all to the character. A special word for Bhumi Pednekar who is emerging as Bollywood’s every woman. She can play and be one with a character from any part of the country. Ranvir Shorey finally gets a role he deserves, underlying the ruthlessness of his character with a rare pathos and poignancy.Sonchiriyastarts off with a corpse and death ominously stalks almost each and every one of its frames. It’s in the sound of the bullets, spurting of the blood, in the many, fabulously mounted encounters.Sonchiriyais a rare bird, the metaphorical redemption that everyone is seeking.Apni apni Sonchiriya, apni apni mukti. It’s ultimately a journey towards finding your own bird of salvation.Chaubey evokes the sense of place by going beyond the arid, stark, larger-than-life landscape. He turns it into a character itself. The sense of place is seeped in the Bundelkhandi, the dacoits speak, the risque and raw humour in the dialogue. It’s in the way they dress. It’s in their body language, their mindsets, in their culture and perceptions. It’s in the minutest of details— whether it’s the reference to the guns of the 1962 war or the Special Task Force, the morning cackling of AIR or Indira Gandhi’s announcement of the Emergency. Then there are nice political potshots that lift it from its specific location and period, to give it a larger universality. It’s like one of the rebels talking about how no one dies from the bullet of the government but by its [false] promises. Hear hear!"

Pre-poll violence in some pockets keeps police on their toes
",,"Even before the notification for the general elections has been issued, parties have begun turning the heat on each other. Sporadic clashes between supporters of ruling and opposition parties in the Gurazala, Vinukonda and Macherla Assembly segments are keeping the police on their toes. The incidents are being viewed as possible pointers to volatile elections in Palnadu, known for its factional violence.On Wednesday, a TV debate at Vinukonda in which the MLA was present, ended on a chaotic note. Two persons were injured when police resorted to a mild lathicharge to disperse the clashing groups. Trouble began when YSRCP leader Bolla Brahma Naidu began criticising the ruling party MLA on the latter’s alleged failure to find a solution to drinking water woes in the segment. Upset over the allegations, the MLA’s supporters began hurling chairs.A day after the violence, YSRCP leaders led by Kasu Mahesh Reddy and Narsaraopet Lok Sabha in-charge Lavu Krishnadevarayulu met Superintendent of Police (Rural) S.V. Rajasekhara Babu and complained against the TDP leaders.Earlier this week, Kakumanu Bhavanarushi from Gurazala attempted to kill himself outside the police station after alleging that Gurazala Circle Inspector Y. Rama Rao abused him and his wife. Mr. Mahesh Reddy lodged a complaint with the DGP and the SP, Guntur and demanded that the CI be immediately transferred.Kodela vs. AmbatiLast week, Gadipudi Adinarayana, son of former MLA G. Mallikarjuna Rao, attempted to hang himself after alleging that the supporters of the Gurazala MLA manhandled him at the site where he was quarrying limestone. In Sattepalli, a war of words is going on between Assembly Speaker Kodela Siva Prasada Rao and YSRCP leader Ambati Rambabu. Mr. Rambabu alleged that Dr. Siva Prasada Rao and his Sivaram had indulged in massive corruption. Dr. Sivaram dismissed the charges out of hand. In the run-up to the polls, clashes broke out between the TDP and YSRCP at Muppala village."

From ancient classics to contemporary writing, the 20th Bharat Rang Mahotsav saw a rich amalgam of foreign productions
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Fifteen foreign plays were presented in the just-concluded 20th Bharat Rang Mahotsav (Bharangam), organised by the National School of Drama (NSD) from 1st to 21st of February, out of which nine were from Asia and six from Europe. There was a balanced mix of ancient classics, modern classics, contemporary writing, and the plays written by the directors themselves. As would be obvious, a rich variety of production levels was seen in these plays from different parts of the world.The Romanian play “Thousand and One Nights”,also known as “Arabian Nights” or “Alif Laila”,takes inspiration from a collection of West Asian folk tales collected over many centuries, some of which trace their roots back to Arabic, Persian, Indian, Greek, Jewish and Turkish folklore, and literature. An interplay of wisdom and love takes place beautifully on the stage, with just two actors playing the game of the shadows, the result of which could be life or death for one of the players.Both the Russian plays “Alien” and “Dear Elena Sergeevna” are original contemporary writings, which raise issues faced by the Russian society of today. “Alien” is a controversial play written by the young Tatar playwright, Sombel Gaffarova. It examines a little-known, painful topic in the 20th Century history of the Tatar people. One of the sad topics for Tatars, was the fate of the Second World War Tatar soldiers and officers captured by the Germans, who refused to cross over to the side of Nazis and passed all the hardships of Hitler’s concentration camps. They, however, became prisoners of Stalin’s concentration camps GULAG after the collapse of the Third Reich. Sensing a new arrest, many did not return to their homeland and scattered all over the world. These Tatars faced serious challenges in preserving their cultural identity. Full of grotesque situations and bitter humour, the play searches for an answer to several questions: how can a people’s identity be understood, and is it possible to return to our past once we have been severed from it?“Dear Elena Sergeevna”, a play by Lyudmila Razumovskaya, is a beautiful exploration of the challenges faced by society in today’s Russia. After the final exams, four schoolchildren understand that they have not passed their exams, and it can break their future career. The teenagers fraudulently enter their teacher Elena Sergeevna’s house and demand the key to the safe in which the examination papers are stored. She refuses. The night drags on into one of those claustrophobic siege sagas, complete with a ringleader. As seems usual in these affairs, the climax combines violence with the sudden repentance of one of the malefactors, but nothing is really resolved. This 1980 social critique was banned until the adoption ofglasnost(openness) doctrine by Mikhail Gorbachev in Russia in 1985.Re-interpreting HomerCzech play “An Iliad” is a re-interpretation of the Greek poet Homer’s “Iliad” by Lisa Peterson and Denis O’Hare. Italian play “Desaparecidos#43” written by Nicola Pianzola and Polish play “Zemsta”(Revenge),written by Aleksandar Fredro and having almost all female actors, were other arrivals from Europe.Among the Asian plays, the three plays from Bangladesh were Sophocles’ “King Oedipus”,“The Open Couple” written by Dario Fo and Franca Rame, and Shakespeare’s “Macbeth”. Ashim Das,thedirector of “King Oedipus”, is not new to this festival, and his work has always been appreciated by the discerning audience of Delhi. This Greek tragedy was enacted with a very energetic production-design by this young director from Bangladesh.The two plays from Nepal were Anton Chekhov’s “Three Sisters”, and “Charaharuko Sammelan”(Conference of the Birds),based on the 12th-century Persian poemThe Conference of the Birdsby Attarof Nishapur (in Iran). The play was very beautifully presented in the physical theatre genre with the highest Asian aesthetic values. “Three Sisters”,directed by Rose Schwietz and produced by Deborah Merola, beautifully presented the Russian life in the times of Chekhov’s Russia.Jehan Aloysius, Sri Lankan playwright and director of “Stormy Weather”, seemed to have been inspired by some old style Hollywood crime thrillers, as the director himself accepts in his director’s note! This genre was quite common in Indian films of the ‘60s likeGumnam,etc. Jehan made extensive use of slide-projection to unsuccessfully create suspense in his play! Thank god, he did not have the mandatory Helen dance like the Indian films of this genre.Young Sri Lankan director Anasuya Subasinghe’s “My Sweet Rotten Heritance”, an original play based on the script written by herself, was pleasantly surprising. She experimented with a Sri Lankan traditional dance-theatre form Kolam to critically examine Sri Lankan society, thereby highlighting the strength of tradition being capable of representing the conditions of society even today! This versatile young all-combined-into-one director, actor, playwright chose Kolam “to re-imagine this moribundKolampractice beyond its ‘fixed’ repertoire, by introducing new narratives familiar to the contemporary spectator.” Using exquisite footwork and hand-gestures, she imaginatively created the narrative on stage, thereby lending continuity to the tradition!The most enchanting play of the international segment of this festival was Ibsen’s “When We Dead Awaken”. It was presented by the artists of Jangama, a collective of five artists trained at the Inter-cultural Theatre Institute, Singapore. Mostly a speechless production, it depends on the breath, gaze, movement, etc. of the actors, ignoring the dialogues of the script almost totally! Directed by young directors Sankar Venkateswaran, even the music was used very sparingly in it. Sankar said, “Human beings spend only around 20% of their time speaking; the rest of the time is in the sphere of silence. Our theatres do not represent that silent aspect of existence enough. They are mostly caught up with language, rhetoric, and text. Also, as a country, as much as the languages offer windows, they also create walls and barriers. So, the language of silence can work across different cultures – I like to explore of the vulnerability of that realm of existence on stage. We should resist loudness in theatre, and concentrate more on small actions, breath, gaze, movement, etc. We should learn to understand the loudness of silence!” His ‘frames’ in the play were sculpture-like, while “inspiration for the movement was taken from the slow-motion theatre styles of Noh from Japan and Wayang from Indonesia,” said Lakshmana, who played Rubek in this play.Less representationHowever, some questions remain. Is the selection of mainly the Western plays even in the Asian segment of the 20th Bharat Rang Mahotsav some indicator of the theatre-scenario in those countries, or is it symptomatic of the flawed system of selection? It will not be impertinent to ask here, why NSD had to select eight plays from just three countries, viz., Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. . No plays were seen from the rest of Asia, Western Europe (except Italy), the Americas, Africa, Oceania, etc. A festival needs much wider global representation to be truly called ‘international’!"

The bill would have banned physical, humiliating, or degrading acts of punishment or discipline by parents or teachers on children.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A draft law that would have made it illegal for parents to smack their children in the Philippines has been vetoed by President Rodrigo Duterte, the presidential palace said on Thursday.The bill would have banned physical, humiliating, or degrading acts of punishment or discipline by parents or teachers on children.It also called for repeat offenders to undergo anger management counselling.“I am aware that there is a growing trend, prevalent in Western nations, that sees all forms of corporal punishment as an outdated form of disciplining children,” Mr. Duterte told Congress, explaining why he would not sign it into law.“I strongly believe that we should resist this trend,” he said in a statement on Thursday, adding he believed parents should be able to impose corporal punishment.The President has also called for the age of criminal liability -- currently 15 years old -- to be lowered, to give more teeth to a narcotics crackdown that has claimed the lives of more than 5,000 drug suspects.Richard Dy, spokesman for the Child Rights Network, told AFP rights groups were surprised at Mr. Duterte’s veto, and said his organisation will call on Congress to vote to override the veto so it becomes law.Mr. Dy said three in five Filipino children are victims of psychological and physical violence, and “more than half of these are happening at home”.“There is a cultural norm in the Philippines that we can hit children in order to discipline them. That's what we wanted changed with this bill,” Mr. Dy said.Studies have shown that corporal punishment of children could lead to depression, suicide, or turn victims into child-smackers themselves when they grow up, Mr. Dy added.Mr. Duterte has said publicly that as a child his mother would hit him “with whatever she could grab” and make him kneel in front of the altar with his arms spread like those of Jesus Christ nailed to the cross as punishment.Mr. Dy said the bill took more than 10 years to pass in the House of Representatives and the Senate, with majority approval secured after its sponsors agreed to drop an early provision that would have imposed jail terms for offenders.Last month parliament passed a controversial bill lowering the minimum age of criminal liability to 12, among measures sought by Mr. Duterte to further extend his deadly crackdown on drugs and crime.However the Senate has yet to pass the bill, which has been criticised by the United Nations and rights monitors."

In an election that had been postponed by a week, the anti-corruption crusader romped home with enough votes to avoid a run-off. In what had been set up as a close contest, Mr. Buhari, who heads the ruling All Progressives Congress, beat former vice-president Atiku Abubakar by about four million votes. The rumblings in the Opposition about vote-rigging by the ruling party may continue to be heard for a while, given the widespread delays and irregularities at polling booths, apart from incidents of violence and several fatalities. But some poll observers believe that the Opposition’s claims are not backed by sufficient proof to make them legally sustainable. The question now is whether Mr. Buhari can convert his convincing mandate for a second term into policies that can boost investment and growth, generate jobs and narrow inequalities. The challenge of unemployment, at over 20% according to official figures, is made more formidable by the rapid increase in the working-age population. The prospects for change hinge on whether Mr. Buhari can live down his reputation as an old-fashioned interventionist leader and open the economy to competition. A test case of that makeover would be the passage of oil sector reform legislation aimed at the privatisation of the state-owned petroleum firm. Mr. Buhari’s record in countering the Islamist Boko Haram in the north of the country and the conflict between herdsmen and farmers in the central region remain unfinished business. On the external front, of particular interest to investors would be the new Nigerian government’s stance on joining the African free-trade agreement. Equally crucial would be Abuja’s backing for Morocco’s membership of the Economic Community of West African States, the 15-nation trading bloc.Exactly 20 years since the country returned to democratic rule in 1999, Nigerians have decisively left behind the uncertainties of repeated military coups that marred their immediate post-colonial history. Equally significant, recent elections suggest limited progress in the conduct of transparent elections compared to the previous decade. But the postponement of the poll by a week, just hours before voters were to cast their ballot, did not inspire confidence. In 2015, the delay was as much as six weeks. Moreover, the large number of poll-related deaths in the last few days points to a disturbing absence of official accountability. A peaceful election is one of the crucial indicators of a credible transfer of power through the ballot. Calm must return in Abuja and the ruling party and the Opposition have a duty to respect the rule of law. Among sub-Saharan Africa’s largest countries, Nigeria should strive to clean up its act."

Ekta Kapoor on the myths of ‘other’ woman, the sacrificial mother, and the emancipated husband ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Mostly fun and always outspoken, Ekta Kapoor is arguably the most prolific creative producer in the country with shows running across platforms. Known to do things differently, and to have an insight into what's simmering beneath the surface, she now has a complex love story centering around an older couple, on her on-demand-video platform AltBalaji. At a time when young romances are the having a moment,Kehne Ko Humsafar Hainis now in its second season. Starring Ekta’sher favourites, Ronit Roy, Mona Singh, and Gurdip Kohli, the series sends out the message that 'happily ever after' needs work, and that sometimes life is about hard choices. Edited excerpts from a conversation.The cast and concept give us a sense that this is a typical Balaji show. Why did it go to a a streaming medium?It would not have worked on television because some time back I had mounted a series with Sonali Bendre and Apoorva Agnihotri (Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Ye). It was about a married woman who develops a bond with a man after her husband cheated on her. When TRPs dropped, the research showed that half the women audiences didn’t want to watch such a show. A common response was that the protagonist’s husband didn’t beat her, so she had no valid reason to find an emotional anchor. Half the women said that if they watch it, their husbands would judge them. I realised that in our country women are judged for what they watch. If you are watching a show about a woman who is having an affair, you become a bad woman. However, I felt the experience should not stop me from putting up stories that are happening.How does the show see the 'other’ woman?When I started this app, I wanted to tell stories from the point of view of the so-called ‘other’ woman. Her image was that of a witch who enchanted this married man. We tend to forget that it it is the man who often tells her that the marriage is not working. I felt that this should change. I called up Mona (Singh) and said, ‘I am making this show and it is important for me that somebody like you play the other woman.’ I was sure from the beginning that you cannot make such a show without stellar actors and the required layering. She was not sure. I had to convince her that as an actor she needed to look beyond the expectations. It is a grey character and half the audience, the women, would not identify with her, but she had to bring them to her side. She’s done an excellent job.The series talks of a Stone Age husband!A completely emancipated husband is a myth. There are two types of men that are evolving. One who says this famous line that he allows his wife to work. It is a terrible line. Then there is another, who is even more covert. He doesn’t mind if she works, but she should be home by the time he is back. And he would underline it saying that it was something his mother used to do. It also tries to understand his point of view. At no point am I making him look bad. Yes, at times I make him look silly, because he's not getting it.Do you question the institution of marriage via the show?We are questioning certain marriages, marriages surviving because of social pressure. Marriages that are based on how your Facebook photo should look or how your kids are going to perceive you in the future. The bottom line is happiness. We take happiness lightly. Instead, sacrifice has been made a good word.Does app technology promote individualism?Of course, it allows you the opportunity to cater to individual tastes. I want to tell different kinds of stories. You should not shy away from anything.Punchbeat, another series on the app is pure escapism. Somebody will watch a programme for the guilty pleasure, someone will watch for relatability and someone will watch for aspirational value.Your views on censorship on these platforms?I believe in self-censorship. We put an age-limit on every show. We clearly mention if there is sex and violence in the show. My view is that there is nothing wrong with watching sex after a certain age. And linking watching sex to sexual crime amounts to taking away responsibility from the perpetrator.You have a presence in films, television, and digital. Do you see one cannibalising the other?We are heading towards an era where all three mediums survive beautifully. Television is for family viewing. You still can’t see a kiss with your father in the room. And the remote is usually given to the eldest or immobile member of the family. Digital will be your individual screen. You don’t need four people to like it, to watch it. The film continues to be for communal viewing. All three tastes are important. The collections of last year show that the film business is going strong.Are you in competition with Netflix and Amazon Prime?We are so local that there is no competition. We have a whole industry of movies based on around 13,000 screens. Then the TV industry, which is 20 times the film industry, is based on 120 million homes with at least one television. There are going to be around 300 million smartphones by 2020. The population of India will never have this problem of this versus that. Among these millions of screens, if I find my share of the audience, I am happy.After watching films likeVeere Di Wedding, you seem to want film heroines to do all the things heroes were criticised for?We never make a statement of right or wrong. The problem begins when you see it as a statement of right or wrong. If a guy enters a room smoking a cigarette, you won’t even notice it. But if you see a woman smoking, you would say that it is not women empowerment. When did we say that it’s empowerment? It is simply a female character. Her job is not to sit on a pedestal.Have kids brought about a change in your personality?I will not change. As a woman, I am not going to have a streak ofmamtasuddenly. I just have to work on time management. I love my child, but he should also learn how to deal with her mother.You must have grown up watching your father’s films where working women were not celebrated...We have this conversation at home many times. Once we were watchingApnapanwhere ReenaRoy chooses career over children. She leaves her child to pursue her job. I told my father that I am that woman the film almost declares a vamp. He said, ‘Kya baat kar rahi hai tu’ (What are you saying?) Now that I have a child, my belief is that it is okay to leave a job for kids, but it is also okay to manage both.For the full interview, log onto thehindu.com"

Only talking to one another is the way forward,” he said.Tehreek-e-Hurriyat chairman Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai also urged “nuclear powers, India and Pakistan, to shun war”. “After fighting costly wars, we have to finally sit on a negotiating table for a solution,” he said.Suspend political activitiesMeanwhile, former chief minister and NC vice president Omar Abdullah urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi “to suspend” political activities until Wing Commander Abhinandan was returned safely.“It can’t be business as usual with him criss-crossing the country at tax payer expense making political speeches while our pilot is a Pakistani captive,” he tweeted."

Calming Arunachal,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/calming-arunachal/article26391137.ece,"
The polity must foster a civic consciousness to allow equality of opportunity for all residents ",,"The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Itanagar has decided not to act on the recommendations of a Joint High Power Committee granting permanent resident certificates (PRCs) to non-Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribes of Namsai and Changlang districts. This decision follows violence in Itanagar, which included arson attacks on the residence of the Deputy Chief Minister. The government took this step to de-escalate tensions despite the fact that both mainstream parties, the Congress and the BJP, were on the same page on the demand to grant the PRCs. The non-APSTs include the Deoris, Sonowal Kacharis, Morans, Mishings, Adivasis and ex-servicemen belonging to the Gorkha community. Successive governments and members of these communities have said PRCs are needed to avail of job and educational opportunities elsewhere in the country, and currently the 26 tribes and numerous sub-tribes who claim to be native to Arunachal Pradesh enjoy this privilege. Members of some of the non-APST communities have been long-time residents of the reconstituted State, and to term them as “outsiders” reflects a chauvinistic mindset that denies a just demand. Previous governments, including one led by the Congress in 2010, had also buckled under pressure on the issue. The indigenous tribes opposing the move say this is one step away from providing Scheduled Tribe status for the non-APSTs, which they vociferously oppose. While this fear is overblown, the award of PRCs could ensure land rights that are otherwise denied to the non-APSTs.The fact that the opposition to the demand took such a violent turn could be linked to a retaliation to attempts by the members of the non-APSTs to enforce an “economic blockade” of the State from the neighbouring parts of Assam last month. But these incidents suggest that barely any northeastern State is today free of the pattern of ethnic discord marked by some communities being branded “outsiders” and sought to be denied resident privileges. These include the Chakma issue in Mizoram, the hill versus valley disturbances in Manipur, the longstanding “migration” issue in Assam, the attacks on Sikh residents in Meghalaya, and even the Chakma/Hajong citizenship issue in Arunachal Pradesh itself. The pattern through all these is eerily similar, with ethnic identities trumping civic consciousness in bringing about discord that has even escalated into violence in some cases. Arunachal Pradesh has otherwise remained a peaceful State, and it is incumbent on the government and the polity to foster a civic consciousness that allows equality of opportunity for all residents in the State. This is a difficult task as identity issues persist and fester when there is inadequate economic development – which is the real bane of the Northeast today."

10 injured as a group raids the colony near Thiruvennainallur despite police presence
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Tension prevailed in Anathur Colony near Thiruvennainallur in the district on Wednesday after a group of caste Hindus vandalised around 20 houses belonging to Dalits after an inter-caste marriage came to light.According to the police, E. Thirumoorthy, 22, of Anathur Colony, was in a relationship with M. Jayapratha, 22, of Anathur. The couple married on January 7 without informing their parents and continued to live in their respective houses. Jayapratha’s parents started looking for a groom for her. She informed Thirumoorthy about this. The couple left their homes on February 21 and their whereabouts are still not known.Meanwhile, Jayapratha’s parents lodged a complaint with the Thiruvennainallur police after they came to know that the couple had a registered their marriage in Cuddalore. The police held talks with both the families and a police picket was posted in Anathur Colony to prevent any clash.Vehicles damagedAround 9.45 a.m. on Wednesday, a group of caste Hindus raided Anathur Colony despite the presence of a few police personnel and ransacked the house of Thirumoorthy and 19 other houses in the colony. Before the residents realised what was happening, the trespassers stormed the tenements and started destroying utensils and other valuables. The group damaged the vehicles parked in the colony. Sources said that around 10 persons, including a one-and-a-half-year-old child, were injured in the violence.Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar visited Anathur Colony and inspected the ransacked houses. A huge posse of police personnel has been stationed at Anathur Colony.Meanwhile, a fact-finding team of Tindivanam-based Social Awareness Society for Youths (SASY) which visited the colony on Wednesday said that the attack was pre-meditated.I. Pandian, executive director of SASY, said that a group of caste Hindus youth who were aware about the inter-caste marriage of the couple planned the attack in a WhatsApp group operated by them a few days ago. He said the couple left their homes fearing for their lives although there was a Madras High Court order to the government to ensure security for inter-caste couples."

He said that any attempt to intervene or come down on one side or another particularly on Kashmir, this would result in Britain losing “credibility.” “The idea that the U.K. should robustly be seen to be on one side of this battle rather than another is self-defeating. It is in the interest of all to have a calm approach.”With a large Indian and Pakistan diaspora in the U.K., MPs from both sides of the political spectrum raised questions about the unfolding situation, with many raising concerns about the human rights situation in Kashmir. “Any allegations of human rights abuses are concerning and need to be investigated thoroughly,” said Mr. Field, during the discussion.Some MPs also raised concerns about the location of the Jaish-e-Mohammed camps in Pakistan. “These groups are based in Pakistan occupied Kashmir and Pakistan… Clearly the answer is that Pakistan should take action to dismantle the terrorist camps and ensure the terrorists are brought to justice,” said Conservative MP Bob Blackman, calling on Mr. Field to tell Pakistan to “own up to its responsibilities.”“Making some categorical statements that are not entirely supportable,” at this time did not help the situation, insisted Mr. Field. He welcomed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s “rhetoric in favour of peace.”Ever since controversial comments by former Labour Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in 2002, suggesting Britain play a role in Kashmir, Britain has adamantly steered clear of taking a stance against one country or the other or for suggesting involvement in resolving the Kashmir dispute, insisting it was a bilateral issue for the two sides, taking into consideration the wishes of the Kashmiri people."

Uneasy calm in Arunachal capital,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/uneasy-calm-in-arunachal-capital/article26370130.ece,,,"An uneasy calm prevailed in Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar and nearby Naharlagun town as security forces kept vigil on Monday, a day after widespread violence and arson left a trail of destruction and death.Chief Minister Pema Khandu held meetings with community-based organisations and students’ unions to “work out peace.”But most political parties, including the Congress and the BJP’s ally, National People’s Party, skipped his call for an all-party meeting.Three persons have been killed in firing by the security forces since Friday night, when a 48-hour shutdown called by 18 indigenous organisations against grant of permanent resident certificates (PRC) to six non-tribal communities turned ugly.Protesters burnt cars, vandalised the venue of the first Itanagar International Film Festival, damaged roadside property and set houses and shopping complexes owned by BJP Ministers and leaders on fire.Mr. Khandu cleared misconceptions and sought the cooperation of all the organisations in restoring peace. “Due to the ongoing crisis, there is a food shortage, people are being deprived of medical care, business, schools, colleges are shut, affecting normal life. Help us create a favourable atmosphere,” he said.The CM expressed pain at the loss of three lives and announced Rs 20 lakh as compensation and a government job for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 10 lakh for those injured."

The state government should immediately work for restoring peace and bringing back normalcy. The protests took place as the state government could not communicate properly to the people on the issue of PRC,” he told reporters here.Mr. Rijiju also denied that there was any move to replace Chief Minister Pema Khandu by the ruling BJP. The Congress has demanded the Chief Minister’s resignation and the imposition of President’s rule in the state.At least three people lost their lives during violent protests over granting the PRC to six non-Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe (APSTs) communities living in Namsai and Changlang districts -- Deoris, Sonowal-Kacharis, Morans, Adivasis and Mishings -- and to the Gorkhas living in Vijaynagar. Most of these communities are recognised as Scheduled Tribes in neighbouring Assam. Mr. Rijiju, who hails from Arunachal Pradesh, said the State government should give compensation to those who were killed and those who received injuries.“The Home Minister (Rajnath Singh) and I have spoken to the Governor and the Chief Minister and told them that peace must be prevailed and adequate compensation should be given to the victims of police firing,” he said.The Union Minister of State for home also blamed the Congress for “politicising” the PRC issue and said the Narendra Modi-led central government has done tremendous work for the development of Arunachal Pradesh as well for the entire Northeastern region and all such initiatives should not go in vain due to protests and violence.“Arunachal Pradesh is a peaceful state and the people are peace loving. The State government should talk to all concerned people and organisations so that peace and harmony come back. I am told the situation is now under fully control,” he said.Army patrolled the streets of Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar on Monday as people gathered on streets defying curfew despite the Chief Minister’s assurance that grant of PRC to six non-native communities in the state was a “closed issue”.Curfew that was clamped in Itanagar and adjoining Naharlagun town on Saturday, but it did not deter protesters from venturing into the troubled streets that were scene of pitched battles with security forces over the last three days that left three people dead, including two in police firing on Sunday.No major incident of violence has been reported from anywhere since Monday morning as Arunachal Scouts, an infantry regiment of the Army trained in mountain warfare, marched through the streets of the two towns to ensure confidence among people and ward off possible violence, officials said."

Urge DGP to issue circular in this regard
",,"In the wake of a woman from Coimbatore, belonging to the LGBT community, seeking help from the Chennai police after her parents reportedly threatened her and her partner, activists feel that there is a need for increased awareness about the rights of the LGBT community among parents and police.A few months ago, Sivagami (name changed), a woman police constable working in Chennai, and Kavitha (name changed), a third-year-engineering student from Coimbatore, got into a relationship. “They met through a common friend. Kavitha informed her parents about her orientation, and asked them not to look for any alliance,” said T.D. Sivakumar, co-founder, Nirangal.Though Sivagami’s mother agreed to the relationship, Kavitha faced resistance from her parents. Subsequently Kavitha came to Chennai and took refuge with an NGO. Her parents contacted the NGO and tried to take their daughter back with them. As they failed in their attempts, they sought help from the Tirumangalam police.On February 18, Kavitha and Sivagami were summoned to the Tirumangalam police station. “Police personnel were talking about Tamil culture and wanted Kavitha to go back with her parents,” said another activist.Senior police officers, however, claimed that they only counselled the parents and the two women. “Being adults, we cannot deny their right to choose their life partner,” said a senior police officer. Subsequently, Kavitha went back to the NGO, while Sivagami has been transferred to another wing in the police department.Risk of violenceHowever, activists feel that Sivagami continues to be at risk of an attack by Kavitha’s parents.“The government should create awareness about Supreme Court decriminalising Section 377 of the IPC, which criminalised consensual relationships among adults. The stigma against LGBT community should end. Society should accept them,” added Mr. Sivakumar.L. Ramakrishnan from the public health NGO SAATHII suggested that the DGP send a circular to all police stations in the State."

Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday.U.S. lawmakers also mentioned North Korea's human rights violations in a letter to Trump on Sunday.“The Singapore meeting gave Kim - the leader of perhaps the world's most repressive regime - legitimacy and acceptance on the global stage while effectively undermining our policy of maximum pressure and sanctions,” U.S. senators from the Democratic Party said in the letter.“Meeting the challenge of North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs, as well as addressing other issues such as North Korea's systemic, gross violations of human rights, is of concern to all Americans and to our allies and partners.”South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva “human rights cannot thrive in the absence of peace”.She said progress towards a “nuclear-free Korean peninsula” that had started would have enormous rewards, including an improvement of the human rights situation."

Mr. Kiren you have to prove it. We have urged the Home Ministry to find out who has instigated,” he said.Alleging that Mr. Rijiju, MP from the State, had failed the people of Arunachal Pradesh by not trying to restore normalcy, the Congress demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ask him to step down or sack him.PRC issueViolent protests broke out in the State over the decision to grant the PRC to Deoris, Sonowal-Kacharis, Morans, Adivasis and Mishings, who are living in Namsai and Changlang districts of the State and the Gorkhas living in Vijaynagar.Though the State government scrapped its decisions following the protests, the Congress leaders pointed out the situation was tense and Chief Minister Pema Khandu had failed to effectively handle the situation."

Tension mounted when a YSRCP activist doused himself with petrol and tried to set himself ablaze.

Sushil Sharma, who spent 23 years in jail for killing his partner Naina Sahni, shares his experience
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In 1995, when the court asked Sushil Sharma whether he was guilty of killing his partner Naina Sahni, he said “not guilty”.“If I had pleaded guilty then, I might have served lesser number of years in jail,” he says.Speaking toThe Hindu, Mr. Sharma, who spent 23 years in jail, says that around 70% of prisoners in Tihar are undertrials. He believes that a major reason why undertrials are languishing in prisons is because their lawyers do not counsel them properly. Mr. Sharma was released from jail in December last year.‘Plead guilty’“I knew I had committed the crime but my lawyer suggested not to plead guilty and the trial went on for 10 years. If the lawyers know that their clients have actually committed the crime then they should suggest them to plead guilty,” he says.Speaking from his years of experience in jail, he says that another reason why undertrials languish in jails for many years is because they are at the mercy of their lawyers and the judicial system.Also ReadJailhouse block: Why are Delhi’s prisons filling up again?“Most of them are uneducated and do not know what is happening in their case. They are told by their lawyers about their hearing dates for which they dress up and show up. In the court, they are represented by their lawyers and then they go back to jail,” he says, after having interacted with many undertrials in Tihar.Recalling a case, Mr. Sharma says he met two people who were imprisoned on a murder charge.Legal aid, counsellingInvestigators had stated that the accused were adults, but after a few years it was discovered through documents in their possession that they were minors at the time of the murder.With the help of legal aid, the Supreme Court ordered their release. However, they had already spent about 12 years in jail by then.Mr. Sharma says legal aid and counselling inside the prison is voluntary. . Talking about the taboo attached with counselling, he says many prisoners do not understand its importance and feel its for those “suffering from mental illnesses”.Similarly, the inmates are “hesitant” to take legal aid.Most of the undertrials are in jail on charges of murder due to personal enmity or sudden provocation, attempt to murder, domestic violence, dowry deaths and charges under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, says Mr. Sharma.“Lately, a lot of those charged with economic offences have also started coming in and their trials seem to run long,” he adds.The treatment meted out to undertrials and convicts is also different, says Mr. Sharma. For instance, working inside the prison is a choice for undertrials, but necessary for convicts.“They [undertrials] choose to work for either monetary reasons or to kill time,” he adds.On whether undertrials come under the influence of hardcore criminals with whom they have to spend time, Mr. Sharma says the situation has changed in the last few years. “Earlier, the hardcore criminals were able to rope-in first-time offenders, but since counselling has become more regular, there seems to be hardly any influence. There are exceptions though,” he adds."

Protesters burnt cars, uprooted the venue of the first Itanagar International Film Festival, damaged roadside property and set houses and shopping complexes owned by the ruling BJP ministers and leaders on fire.""Today [Monday] I have talked to a few organisations of different communities over the phone and called for a meeting with them at 10 am to discuss the present situation. Along with that, I have called for an all-party meeting to have a detailed discussion regarding the recent situation and the PRC issues,” Mr. Khandu said in a series of early morning messages.Also ReadProtests, arson rock Itanagar, two dead“I have cleared the government stand on February 22 that we are not taking the PRC matter forward and want to reassure that we will not take up the issue of issuing PRC to non-APST (Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe) in future. Still, a few incidents are taking place where few young boys have lost their lives and are injured. I am deeply saddened for this and once the situation is normalised, I will visit the families personally,” he said.Appealing for an end to the protest and cooperation with the government for maintaining peace as the “PRC issue has been ended”, the Chief Minister said a commissioner-level probe had been ordered to find the facts behind the unrest that led to widespread damage.“I believe there are some forces behind all the incidents. Arunachal Pradesh is a peaceful State and specially Itanagar is very peaceful, but there might be the hand of few people in the violent incidents that took place in the night. The incident took place on Sunday and I think the latest stand of government regarding PRC is not reaching the masses,” he said.“Though the forces have been increased, It is not a matter of satisfaction to me as I believe that fewer security personnel is better for society and future. They are here for our safety only, but not for any untoward situation that might happen,” he said adding that ex-gratia had been announced for those killed in the protest.Resignation demandedThe protesters had set 5 p.m. on Sunday as the deadline for Mr. Khandu, Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein and Chief Secretary Satya Gopal to resign for “betraying the indigenous communities”.In a bid to douse the flames, the Chief Secretary issued a statement, saying that the government had decided never to take up the PRC issue again. In the evening, the Chief Minister called for an all-party meeting but no one responded.“We will attend only if the Governor summons such a meeting,” said Mutchu Mithi, leader of the Arunachal Pradesh unit of the National People’s Party.His party chief and Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma called for peace and an amicable solution to the sensitive issue.Meanwhile, a curfew-like situation continued to prevail in State capital Itanagar and neighbouring Naharlagun town, with security forces patrolling the sensitive areas to keep trouble-makers away."

All political parties for conflict resolution mechanism in State
",,"The recurrence of political murders and the possibility of reprisals have yet again raised the need for having a multi-tier conflict resolution mechanism in the State to nip violence in the bud.Following the murder of two Youth Congress activists in Kasaragod, the UDF and the BJP have turned up their heat on the CPI(M).Despite CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan condemning violence and rejecting the party’s links with the incident, the Opposition has refused to relent.The murder has yet again brought to the fore the need for having a mechanism comprising political leaders, elected representatives, and officials at the district and grassroots levels to prevent such incidents. But compliance with the decisions of such a mechanism is a vexatious issue.Though informal, the primary aim of such a system is to settle local issues, both personal and political among workers and curb violence from flaring up across a district or the State. Having a channel of communication among district and local leaders of all hues is imperative in this case.A meeting of such leaders at regular intervals, or as and when need arises, would help to resolve all disputes. Often the distinction is quite thin and an intervention at the right time could prevent such incidents.LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan toldThe Hinduthat the CPI(M) was not opposed to any such system and it had already been experimented in Kannur. “Since we are the victims of political violence and murder in the State, the CPI(M) is not averse to any mechanism that would stymie the spread of violence. Most of the murders, including the latest, are perhaps an over-reaction to local issues and could be quelled easily. We are open to such arrangements, but there should be a commitment to honour peace pacts,” he said.Foolproof systemCongress leader V.M. Sudheeran placed the onus for the recurrence of violence squarely on the CPI(M) and said there should be a foolproof system to bring the conspirators and perpetrators to book.“Quite often those who act behind the scenes and actively involve in such incidents go scot-free for want of a thorough probe. The genuineness of the accused presented in such cases also raises serious doubts. The entire system needs to be bolstered,” he said.BJP State spokesperson M.S. Kumar accused the CPI(M) of failing to discharge its role in preventing violence."

Ms. Mangaldas is one of the performers at the two-day convention under the banner “Artists Unite” beginning next month at the Lal Qila against the “dangerous and cynical triggering of violence and communal hatred”.More than 200 musicians, artists and poets from across the country will come together to perform at multiple platforms in one space on March 2 and 3 where thousands of people will pass through each day. There will be a main stage active in the evenings. During the day, programmes will run simultaneously at several platforms and these include, a performance stage for theatre, a stage for young musicians and spoken word poetry, a visual arts space for installations and other forms of display, a children’s space for music, story-telling, art work and performances. Programmes will simultaneously be held in Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Kolkata, Dharwad, Chandigarh, Pune, Ahmedabad, Patna and Bhubaneswar.Disciple of Pandit Birju Maharaj, Ms. Mangaldas said she felt the need to celebrate the uniqueness of this diverse country and it prompted her to be part of this convention. She said India was made of “diverse colours”, “diverse fragrances” and “diverse nuances”, and we all must fight to preserve this diversity. “Every responsible citizen of this country must now take a stand on this,” the Kathak exponent said.Underlining the significance of convention in fight against hate , Ms. Mangaldas, said violence was not uncommon to humanity, but turning blind eye to it and encouraging it with statements and actions or the lack of it is not good for a democratic society. “A political party not open to criticism is like a river without banks. It can cause huge devastation,” she said.Declaration of IntentArtists Unite, a platform of writers and artists from across the country who have come together for the cause, also recently came out with a detailed ‘Declaration of Intent’ signed by hundreds of artists and writers.Gurugram-based independent filmmaker Rahul Roy said the declaration is the catalyst for collective events across the country. He said the idea behind the convention is to weigh in with a collective voice, and with a creative energy that reinforced the idea that culture is the glue that kept India together.“India is a uniquely rich repository of cultures that evolved out of long histories of philosophical, religious, literary, linguistic and artistic encounters. As cultural practitioners, it is our responsibility to protect the legacy of India which resides in its history of plurality,” said Mr. Roy.On the political significance of the convention, Taru Dalmia, a reggae artist, said the State is acting in an increasingly authoritarian manner and basic freedom are under attack in India. He added that hate is being used as a political currency and narrow nationalism that didn’t allow questioning or nuanced debate is being forced on them.“Politicians and large sections of the media are speaking in a language that mandates murder. There is an attempt to scare us into submission and to silent inconvenient voices. We have seen writers murdered, professors, journalists, students, activists and lawyers jailed,” said Mr. Dalmia, who is also part of the band called The Ska Vengers.Mr. Dalmia said many communities and individuals in India are resisting. “As artists we are not part of a single community. We come from different disciplines and beliefs. But we all felt the need to speak out collectively. Many have come together to organise festivals and use their music, voices, images and bodies to demonstrate unity, to say that we are not afraid to speak out and that we want a more inclusive and equal society,” Mr. Dalmia summed up.Among others, Shubha Mudgal, Rabbi Shergill, Astad Deboo, Maya Rao, Jasbir Jassi and Chaar Yaar, Dhruv Sangari and Shital Saathe have committed to perform at the Delhi event."

And because we wear baseball caps we’re clearly delinquents!“But it’s the opposite, we put all our aggression into dance,” he said.There’s a family atmosphere at Battle Pro, with parents and children mingling.Deborah Lombo has turned up with her nine-year-old daughter, Cassie.“This is the first time we’ve come to watch breakdancing. There’s a warm side, it’s not like classical dance,” said Deborah.“I think my eyes are going to be opened. The boys are watching football back home so we’re on a girls’ night out” she added.“The DJ is really important, he’s the one who dictates the tempo and rhythm for the dancers. Almost 80% of DJs are former dancers,” recounts Zoubir, founder of Battle Pro 19 years ago.Breakdancing, known as breaking, appeared at the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, in the form of head-to-head “battles”."

"Bangladesh’s war on drugs, far from over",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/bangladeshs-war-on-drugs-far-from-over/article26339898.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In Teknaf, about 100 drug traffickers gave themselves up at a rare ceremony that played out at a local school on February 16. The coastal town that borders Myanmar rose to infamy as a hub of yaba trade.The surrender of traffickers, brokered by the government, is the latest effort in Bangladesh’s crackdown on drugs. About 300 people have died in the so-called crossfires and 25,000 others have been arrested since the government started its nationwide anti-drug raids in May 2018.The crackdown came after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made a speech pledging to curb drug problems. Many likened it to the Philippines’s controversial war on drugs that has triggered criticism from rights groups.Security forces separately claimed that the deaths were a result of gun violence during anti-drug operations. The deaths occurred in clashes either between drug dealers and law enforcement officials, or between rival gangs. However, some relatives of the dead claim that the victims were taken from their homes by law-enforcement officers and executed.The surrender by traffickers on February 16 emerged as a major symbol. The traffickers submitted 30 kg of yaba tablets and 30 weapons in exchange for flowers in a show of cooperation.Most popular stimulantBangladesh recorded 9,069 narcotics cases in January, accounting for 52% of all police cases, according to the latest government data. Some seven million people use drugs in Bangladesh, with yaba being the most popular stimulant, according to the Department of Narcotics Control. Security forces seized a record 53 million yaba pills in 2018.Inspector-General of Police Mohammad Javed Patwary vowed to expand the initiative to every district as Bangladesh’s drug war appears far from over. “All forms of legal support will be provided to those who have turned themselves in to the police. We will try to complete their cases within a short time,” Mr. Patwary said in the presence of his boss, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, during the surrender.Mr. Patwary pledged to free Bangladesh from the scourge of illicit drugs and ordered his deputies to continue anti-drug operations against the banned methamphetamine-based substance.“This formal surrender is part of the government’s ongoing war against drugs,” said Mr. Khan at the programme. “Those who surrendered would be given a second chance to live a normal life. Those who haven’t yet will face dire consequences,” Mr. Khan said.Not everyone is convinced.“The government has been talking about steps to stop drug abuse over the last 12 years, but has failed to bring it down. What you’re seeing in the name of yaba traffickers’ surrender is a farce,” said Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, a senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, an Opposition group that opted out of parliament.Jatiya Party’s Fakhrul Imam, a member of the Opposition camp in Parliament, also raised questions over the involvement of former Awami League MP Abdur Rahman in the government’s efforts to prevent drug peddling. Mr. Rahman, popularly known as Bodi, reportedly tops a government list of drug lords, wielding huge influence over the yaba route from Myanmar’s border areas to Teknaf in southeastern Bangladesh.Mr. Rahman denies any connection to illicit drug trade. Amid a public outcry over his alleged links to yaba trade, the Awami League handpicked his wife Shahin Akhtar as the candidate for the December election. After winning the polls, Ms. Akhtar and her husband vowed to fight yaba trade in the tourist district of Cox’s Bazar and asked the traffickers to surrender.The ceremonial surrender by the traffickers does not end Bangladesh’s struggle to contain drug problems. In parallel, the killings of offenders in anti-narcotics raids are continuing. More deaths in “gun violence” have been reported from different districts since the surrender. That means Bangladesh will face further questions over its handling of drug lords as the killings violate the offenders’ right to life and a fair trial.A peaceful surrender by about 100 traffickers notwithstanding, the country continues to face questions on its approach to solving the drug menace"

Army and paramilitary personnel, called to restore normality, were pelted with stones too.Violence in Itanagar, triggered by the government’s move to provide permanent resident certificates (PRC) to six non-tribal communities living in the Frontier State for decades, appeared to have subsided after Mr. Khandu announced on February 22 night that the PRC issue would not be discussed during the ongoing Assembly session.On February 23, the city administration clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC and sought the help of the Army that conducted a flag-march.

Mr. Rebia headed the joint high power committee that recommends granting PRC to six non-tribal communities in the State.Political leaders in Arunachal Pradesh said the violence had a pattern similar to that in October 2011 forcing Jarbom Gamlin to resign as Chief Minister after a six-month rule."

Who was this powerful and revolutionary leader who died while in office?2 As India ushered in its Independence, she was part of the choir that sang ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Jana Gana Mana’ before Nehru’s ‘Tryst with Destiny’ speech. She was also among the 15 women chosen to draft the Indian Constitution as part of the legendary Constituent Assembly.

Her tenure was marked by her ability to arrest the economic slide of one of India’s biggest states at that time.

The lowdown on Trump and the Mexico wall,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-lowdown-on-trump-and-the-mexico-wall/article26355132.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"What is it?Although the definition has periodically changed shape, mostly due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s different characterisations of it, “The Wall” refers to Mr. Trump’s pet project of constructing a physical wall along (parts of) the U.S.-Mexico border.How did it come about?The Wall, as a continuous physical structure that stretches “from sea to shining sea” along the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border, has not come about yet. Only 654 miles of the 1,954-mile border has some form of physical barrier at the moment. Mr. Trump started putting out his idea of a wall to check immigration on social media as early as 2014. In 2015, his statements suggested that he was settling on the idea of building a structure for a total of 1,000 miles, saying there were physical barriers for the rest.Why does it matter?The existence of a wall matters for many reasons. Building a wall is ethically questionable. As per international law that the U.S. has signed up to, it is the right of individuals to present themselves at the U.S. border to seek asylum. The wall is also likely to put thousands of lives at significantly greater risk. Those fleeing drug and gang violence in Central America and making the dangerous and arduous journey across the U.S. border are unlikely to be deterred by a wall. It is the centre-piece of the Trump administration’s extreme border policies, which have included separating migrant children from their parents.The wall also matters because it has come as a policy agenda that is often not substantiated by facts or is based on what is only partially true. Mr. Trump’s reasons for building the wall have been based on partially or wholly untrue claims related to the volume of illegal migrants being apprehended at the border, the cost of immigration and the danger posed by illegal migrants. The wall is a divisive issue — a stand-off between Congressional Democrats and Mr. Trump resulted in the longest-ever partial federal government shutdown in December and January that affected some 800,000 workers. The wall drive will be a part of his 2020 re-election campaign.What next?After Congress granted Mr. Trump just $1.3 billion of the $5.7 billion he had requested for the wall, the President declared a national emergency to redirect monies from military construction funds, anti-drug funding and the Treasury Department. Earlier this week, 16 States filed a case against Mr. Trump, arguing that Congress controls spending. Prior to this lawsuit, two cases had been filed by Texas landowners and environmental groups. These battles are likely to end up in the Supreme Court, where they could go either way. The House and Senate can pass a joint resolution ending the emergency and the House is likely to pass one when it reconvenes after recess. Even if the Senate were to pass the resolution, Mr. Trump could veto it. Ending the emergency would then need a super-majority in Congress to override a presidential veto. The House could also potentially sue the administration or join another party’s lawsuit.Sriram Lakshman"

Accused was addicted to alcohol
",,"A woman, who was three months pregnant, was strangled to death by her husband in a drunken state at their residence in Asif Nagar here on Saturday, following a quarrel.After killing 24-year-old K. Shalini, the accused, P. Vijay Kumar, a painter, allegedly sat next to her body for a while, and surrendered before the police. He told them that he had strangled Shalini around 3.30 a.m. after the couple had a fight. Soon after getting information about the murder from a regional newspaper scribe, the Asif Nagar police rushed to the spot and recovered the woman’s body, which was found lying on the floor.In 2013, Vijay married Shalini, who was his neighbour after they both fell in love, and their families accepted. The couple have three children and she had conceived for the fourth time, said Asif Nagar Assistant Commissioner of Police N. Narsimha Reddy. He said that the couple had frequent altercations and Vijay and his elderly mother used to beat her. The accused, who was a part-time craftsman, was addicted to alcohol.On Friday afternoon too, Shalini approached the Asif Nagar police complaining about her husband’s behaviour, following which Vijay was summoned at the police station, where the couple were given counselling and let off. “The murder took place hours after they were counselled by our staff,” an officer said.Based on the complaint lodged by the victim’s mother, who resides in the same locality, a case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of IPC was invoked against Vijay, while his mother was booked for domestic violence.Teen drowns in poolA 15-year-old school dropout drowned in a swimming pool at Sridevi Colony in Rajendra Nagar here on Friday evening.

These measures came after protesters went on the rampage, destroying private and government property and setting cars on fire.Trouble over PRCThe violence coincided with the start of the first Itanagar International Film Festival that aims to pitch the frontier State as a film destination. A mob ran through the festival venue — Indira Gandhi Park in the heart of the city — destroyed five inflatable cinema halls and cars, among others.This forced the organisers, a Goa-based firm, to call the festival off.The mobs continued to vandalise property and burn vehicles until about 4.30 a.m. on Saturday, much after Chief Minister Pema Khandu tried to douse the flames by announcing that his government would not discuss the PRC issue during the current Assembly session “keeping in view the present situation”.Officials in Itanagar said a mob — women and elderly among them — surrounded the Assembly building and threatened to burn it down. They damaged the vehicle of former Chief Minister Nabam Tuki at the gates as most of the other MLAs stayed the night in the Assembly for fear of being assaulted.The police resorted to firing when another group tried to storm the Secretariat building in Itanagar. A man from Kimin in Papum Pare district died in the firing while another person, injured, was being treated at the Tomo Riba Institute of Health and Medical Sciences at Naharlagun nearby.Security was particularly strengthened around the house of Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein as the protesters threatened to bury the body of the man killed in police firing at his residence.Mr. Mein, along with Mr. Khandu, had sought the granting of PRC to six of the State’s non-tribal communities — Adivasi, Deori, Gorkha, Moran, Mishing, and Sonowal Kachari — some of whom are Scheduled Tribes in Assam.These six communities are dominant in Changlang and Namsai districts of Arunachal Pradesh. Mr. Mein represents the Lekang Assembly constituency in Namsai district.Internet services shutIn an order on Friday night, the State’s Home Commissioner G.S. Meena said telecom service providers have been asked to suspend Internet services for the next 24 hours. “This is in view of the law and order situation to avoid rumour-mongering through the Internet,” he said.The Chief Minister on Saturday appealed for calm, accusing “vested interests” of misleading the people over the PRC issue. “The government had never intended to bring a Bill on the PRC issue, which was blown out of proportion leading to misunderstanding among the people,” he said.One of the worst affected by the mob violence was Nagaland-based singer, composer, and songwriter Alobo Naga, the frontman of popular rock band Alobo Naga and The Band (ANTB).He had reached Itanagar to perform at the film festival.“Trouble had started brewing when I arrived here. I thought the film festival venue would be a safer place to park my music van than the hotel. This (Saturday) morning, I found my van burnt along with my guitar, keyboard and other music instruments,” he toldThe Hindufrom Itanagar."

He had reached Itanagar on the fateful day to perform at the film festival.Many of Alobo Naga’s shows across the globe have been in conflict zones. He had a first-hand experience of violence in Itanagar, the place he least expected to be “caught in the crossfire”.Winner of the Best Indian Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2012, Mr Naga said he had never imagined in his worst nightmare that he would become the victim of mob violence.“Trouble had started brewing when I arrived here. I thought the film festival venue would be a safer place to park my music van than the hotel. This (Saturday) morning, I found my van burn along with my guitar, keyboard and other music instruments,” he told The Hindu from Itanagar.The van, he said, was worth Rs 25 lakh and the music instruments priceless.Other participants at IIFF too were counting losses like the Nagaland rock band. A Guwahati-based supplier of acoustics and tent material said the mob destroyed “almost everything” running into a few million rupees.Apart from damaging at least 20 vehicles at the Dorjee Khandu Convention Centre – in Itanagar’s VIP area – where the main screen of the film festival was installed, the mob destroyed five inflatable screens at the Indira Gandhi Park besides everything else standing there.“We had installed five inflatable halls with a screen, each with a capacity for 130-150 people. They are all damaged,” an organiser said, declining to be quoted.“Many artistes invited for the film festival were caught at the venue the whole night. The protestors did not harm anyone but cars and equipment of many artistes,” film-maker Utpal Borpujari said after participants were escorted out of Itanagar.The organisers had curated 51 films, seven from film-makers of the north-eastern sates, for the festival. The films included Bulbul Can Sing by national award-winning director Rima Das of Assam."

Accused was alcoholic and used to have frequent altercations at home ",,"A three-month pregnant woman was strangled to death by her husband in a drunken state at their residence in Asif Nagar here on Saturday, following a quarrel.After killing 24-year-old K. Shalini, the accused, P. Vijay Kumar, a painter, allegedly sat next to her body for a while, and surrendered before the police. He told them that he had strangled Shalini around 3.30 a.m. after the couple had a fight. Soon after getting information about the murder from a regional newspaper scribe, the Asif Nagar police rushed to the spot and recovered the woman’s body, which was found lying on the floor.In 2013, Vijay married Shalini, who was his neighbour after they both fell in love, and their families accepted. The couple have three children and she had conceived for the fourth time, said Asif Nagar Assistant Commissioner of Police N. Narsimha Reddy. He said that the couple had frequent altercations and Vijay and his elderly mother used to beat her. The accused, who was a part-time craftsman, was addicted to alcohol.On Friday afternoon too, Shalini approached the Asif Nagar police complaining about her husband’s behaviour, following which Vijay was summoned at the police station, where the couple were given counselling and let off. “The murder took place hours after they were counselled by our staff,” an officer said.Based on the complaint lodged by the victim’s mother, who resides in the same locality, a case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of IPC was invoked against Vijay, while his mother was booked for domestic violence."
"In Kerala homes, male domination is still the norm: Shoba Arun",https://www.thehindu.com/society/in-kerala-homes-male-domination-is-still-the-norm-shoba-arun/article26338922.ece,"
This sociologist finds definite signs of regression in Kerala’s famously progressive cultural fabric
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Shoba Arun calls the Malayali woman an enigma, but not in an obscure, romanticised way. “A State with an inspiring political past, yet no iconic woman leader. A land of labour reforms, yet Pombilai Orumai never had the backing of any trade union. While support poured in from all corners last month for a symbolic effort like the women’s wall, the nuns fighting for justice never saw such solidarity. A society so progressive, but the victim of a sexual crime is slut shamed in public. The well-cited Malayali woman is definitely not what you think her to be, her identity has more complexities and contradictions,” says the sociologist who lectures at Manchester Metropolitan University, U.K.In her bookDevelopment and Gender Capital in India: Change, Continuity and Conflict in Kerala, Arun tries to explore the paradox that is the Kerala woman by placing her within the theoretical framework developed by French intellectual and sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, and adopted by feminist Bourdieusians.Increasing misogynyShe argues that despite very good socio-demographic indicators, the Kerala woman’s role in the development discourse is marred by increasing levels of misogyny. “When you check the gender development index in the 90s, you find that Kerala always forged ahead. But the situation now is more complex. Today, Kerala has high literacy levels and a mass of highly-educated women, but you also see many of them sacrificing their careers to meet the demands of domesticity. And to top it all, the purity of the woman’s body has emerged as a major topic of discussion, which again is a regressive trend.” As a Malayali migrant who grew up in the sleepy Nilgiris, Arun was always intrigued by the stark reality of unequal ‘life experiences’ based on gender. “My parents were often asked why they wanted to educate their daughters when my peers were married off soon after puberty.”Arun builds her book on the concept of gender capital or more specifically, ‘female’ and ‘feminine capital’, that is, the way women are socialised into a gender role. Female capital is about the biological notion of gender, where forms of capital can be accumulated, for example, through education. Feminine capital is the gender capital advantage through socialisation and social construction around gender roles. “As a woman, you acquire certain traits, skills and attitudes that fit the generally-accepted template of femininity. You are not accepted into fields that demand dominance or aggression and, at the end of the day, you are reduced to a particular gender role. And because of that, there are limits to how much we can progress or how female and feminine capital can be accumulated or converted into other forms of capital.” She also observes that women in Kerala, as in many male-dominant cultures and contexts, straddle the female and feminine capital construction and accumulation process.Our movie dialogues drip misogyny. Look at how women are portrayed in most films — they are either domesticated, subordinated idols or objectified sirensArun’s book also zooms into specific groups — adivasis and semi-rural livelihoods — as ethnicity and class are crucial in defining notions of femininity. She also finds many intersecting influences on gender. “In many areas, we stand far above the national average, but the adivasi capital in Kerala is always represented as deficit. The average adivasi woman is still caught in a loop of abuse and exploitation; she is always the ‘other’. So when we talk about Kerala women, we are not talking about a heterogeneous cross-section. Not all women in Kerala can increase their social, cultural and financial capital on equal terms; it depends on their diverse social locations and there is no homogeneity in their experience.” Arun says that a paradigm shift from mere representation to a more embedded transformation is needed. “This should take into account the ‘lived experiences’ of women in Kerala.”Arun began mapping Kerala women and their diversity of experience two decades ago and she points to the reversal of matriliny as a major change. The kinship system that appreciated and valued feminine capital had women as inheritors of family property. “I started working on the subject in the 90s and later revisited the same communities and households multiple times, covering three generations of women. Even in the 90s, many families followed the system of polyandry, but now this female-centric social structure has dissipated,” she says.Regressive filmsArun finds definite signs of regression in Kerala’s cultural fabric. “Our movie dialogues drip misogyny. Look at how women are portrayed in most films — they are either domesticated, subordinated idols or objectified sirens. And when we analyse the infamous actress attack case and the discourse it generated, what we see is varying degrees of victim shaming. This is no stray incident; more and more women face cyber bullying today.”She finds that the Malayali woman, who is considered an achiever of feminist goals and human rights, is often victimised and subjugated in a wider context of material, economic and political equations. She says it’s an ‘anomie’ which, in Kerala’s context, does not mean normlessness but an incongruity of norms, and a bias that legitimises social hierarchies. “There are terms like ‘appropriate dressing’ and ‘modesty’, and how women are ‘not expected to be seen in public places after dark’, that point to gendered notions concerning the body, morality and safety. Often, the feminist notions of equality and liberation are inappropriate within homes — a private sphere where male domination is a cultural norm. Even when we look at the Sabarimala issue, we find a multitude of voices, where the root of the issue relates to women’s bodies as polluting and unequal. And despite the impressive pointers of women’s progress, violence against women is also high in Kerala,” she says.What Arun recommends is a perspective beyond the mere rhetoric of gender autonomy, which is often confined to examples of women’s solidarity such as Kudumbashree. “At one level, we see the Malayali woman as this icon of empowerment, but Kerala could have achieved more in terms of transforming gender relations in a number of spheres, including work, political representation, and social justice. While women in other States are quickly achieving more and are all set to overtake Kerala, we are slowly slipping back to regressive social structures which cannot be merely analaysed as patriarchal domination. We need a new discourse that addresses the wider, heterogeneous reality,” she says.[email protected]"

Singh said after the matter came to light, the institute conducted a probe, following which the fellowship and scholarship of two students were blocked while the name of the third, who had enrolled for a masters degree and was absent since December 2018, was struck off.Bareilly Senior Superintendent of Police K. Muniraj said on the complaint of the VHP’s mahanagar unit vice-president Amit Sharma, a case was filed against the three students at the Izzatnagar police station on February 22 evening.Police’s intelligence unit is looking for the person who had originally posted the controversial comment which was forwarded on WhatsApp by the three girls along with their own comments, the police officer said, adding further action will be taken after investigation.Forty CRPF personnel were killed on February 14 in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district for which the Jaish-e-Mohammad has taken responsibility.Earlier this week, seven Kashmiri students were suspended by Roorkee-based Quantum Global University for their alleged anti-national posts on social media."
Showdown looms in Venezuela over aid,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/showdown-looms-in-venezuela-over-aid/article26353127.ece,"
Opposition volunteers in neighbouring Brazil and Colombia are set to confront troops on the border ",,"Venezuela’s Opposition and activists prepared on Saturday to confront troops stationed along the country’s borders to block their plan to bring in food and medicine that authorities are calling a veiled U.S.-backed invasion.Opposition volunteers in neighbouring Brazil and Colombia planned to arrive at the border to help carry humanitarian aid to a sick and hungry population suffering from an economic meltdown under President Nicolás Maduro .While the need for basic food and medicines is real, the effort is also meant to embarrass military officers who continue to support Mr. Maduro's increasingly isolated government.Juan Guaidó, recognised by most Western nations as the country’s legitimate head of state, defied court orders not to leave Venezuela by arriving on Friday in the Colombian border city of Cúcuta, where aid from the U.S. and Colombian governments is stockpiled in warehouses.Mr. Guaidó, 35, head of the Opposition-run Congress, has provided few details on the transport plan. Trucks are expected to be driven by Venezuelan volunteers and some Opposition figures have suggested forming human chains.“Today, the obstacles that the dictatorship created will tomorrow be rivers of unity, of peace,” Mr. Guaidó said in a news conference on Friday in Cúcuta, where he was received by Colombian PresidentIván Duque Márquez.Venezuelan soldiers may bar the way.Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez said in a tweet late on Friday that Venezuela’s government shut the Tachira border that connects it with Cúcuta temporarily “due to a series of illegal threats” by Colombia.A group of frustrated Venezuelans who were seeking to cross into Colombia on Saturday to work on morning threw rocks and bottles at National Guard troops, who responded with tear gas.“We were all going to work, we want to work, the people attempted to force through,” said Viviana Meza, 29, who works in a Cúcuta restaurant.At least four National Guard officers on Saturday at the border disavowed Mr. Maduro’s government and requested assistance from the Colombian government, Colombia’s migration agency said on Saturday.Videos on social media showed crowds first jeering and then cheering the men as they were escorted away by Colombian police.Dire situationMr. Maduro blames the country’s dire situation on U.S. sanctions that have blocked the country from obtaining financing and have hobbled the OPEC nation’s oil industry. Ms. Rodríguez says the aid is poisoned.Concerns about the potential for violence flared on Friday when the Venezuelan Army opened fire in an village near the Brazilian border after indigenous leaders attempted to prevent them from advancing, killing a woman and her husband.“I don’t plan to leave my house over the weekend, especially after what happened near Brazil,” said Paulina Sanchez, a 68-year-old grandmother who lives just 300 metres from the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge, one of the crossings through which aid may pass. “This could turn into a powder keg.”Nearly 2,00,000 people attended a benefit concert in Cúcuta on Friday featuring Latin pop stars, including Luis Fonsi of ”Despacito” fame, many of whom called on Mr. Maduro to step down.A rival concert held by the ruling Socialist Party on the Venezuelan side was sparsely attended. Mr. Guaidó in January invoked articles of the Constitution to assume interim presidency and denounced Mr. Maduro as a usurper, arguing his 2018 re-election was illegitimate.UN Secretary-GeneralAntónio Guterres urged Venezuelan authorities to refrain from using lethal force against protesters. The U.S. “strongly condemns the Venezuelan military’s use of force against unarmed civilians and innocent volunteers” on the border with Brazil, the White House said.UN figures show that some 2.7 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015 amid the crisis, and some 5,000 Venezuelans emigrate from their country each day."

Northerners versus southerners, farmers against herders, the corrupt savaging the poor.“This is Nigeria.

Monitoring could suffer as “numerous organizations, particularly Nigerian ones, may be reluctant or unable to do it all over again.”President Muhammadu Buhari , an ailing 76-year-old former military dictator, this week threatened death to anyone found disrupting the election, then told Nigerians on Friday they would be able to vote without fear. In the latest political violence, at least two people died as supporters of the two main parties clashed with machetes and clubs on Thursday outside Kano, witness Ahmed Garba said.Mr. Buhari seeks a second term after widely seen as failing to deliver on key issues of security, the economy and fighting corruption. Extremists are making a deadly resurgence. Scores of people were killed last week alone in farmer-herder clashes. The oil-dependent economy is still weak after a recession, with unemployment now over 23 %.Mr. Buhari’s main challenger is 72-year-old former vice president and billionaire Atiku Abubakar, who promises to tap his business success to “Make Nigeria Work Again” but has not managed to shake corruption allegations.Many Nigerians are underwhelmed by the choice between the two Muslims from the north, who between them have run for president nine times.“I feel as a people, we don’t realize how bad things are and that we have the right to demand better,” said author Abubakar Adam Ibrahim. He was 5 when Mr. Buhari was toppled in 1985, then watched his 5-year-old son cheer at Buhari’s win in 2015. “We are essentially not going anywhere,” Mr. Ibrahim said.The rise of young contenders in a country where the majority of voters are between 18 and 35 has been limited by the high costs of running.Salisu Mubarak Muhammad, a 35-year-old who is running to be Kano state’s governor, said his family refused to donate to his campaign, seeing it pointless when top parties are believed to spend far in excess of campaign limits and vote-buying is widespread.Mr. Buhari and Mr. Abubakar’s parties have sniped at each other over the election delay that the electoral commission blamed in part on the weather, alleging it was orchestrated to create space for vote-rigging.But “this is largely just a colossal mess based on logistics, the massive work that needed to be done,” said John Tomaszewski, African regional director with the International Republican Institute, one election observer team.Some Nigerians have used the delay to cause mischief. Fake news blooms. “I have not resigned!” Vice President Yemi Osinbajo declared Thursday on Twitter.“There is quite a lot of ratcheting of divisive narratives on social media,” said Amara Nwankpa with the Yar’Adua Foundation, who oversees a project flagging hate speech to an election crisis center under Nigeria’s national security adviser.Most of the country’s 190 million people, however, are offline and deep in poverty, and they could determine Saturday’s election. A cement block seller in Kano held up his battered mobile phone. It now costs three times as much as before Mr. Buhari took office, he said.Bookseller James Eze has no idea what Abubakar might bring to the presidency, but he can’t take four more years of Mr. Buhari.Business has dropped dramatically, Mr. Eze said. He shooed away a child beggar hovering at the door, saying people no longer have spare money for such charity.Considering everything God blessed Nigeria with, political elites have ruined it, he said. “They’re not fighting for Nigeria, they’re fighting among themselves.”"
Trans asylum-seeker killed after U.S. deportation back to El Salvador,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trans-asylum-seeker-killed-after-us-deportation-back-to-el-salvador/article26347866.ece,"
Members of the LGBTQ community have been fleeing high rates of persecution in their home countries.
",,"A Salvadoran transgender woman who sought asylum in the United States was killed weeks after she was deported, a rights group said on Friday, underscoring the dangers of the Trump administration's hardening policy on asylum seekers.El Salvador's ASPIDH Rainbow Trans Association said Camila Diaz Cordova, a 29-year-old sex worker, applied for asylum in the United States in August 2017 to escape death threats and extortion by multi-national gang Barrio 18.The gang is one of two criminal organizations that control large urban swathes of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.U.S. immigration authorities have confirmed they deported Diaz Cordova in November 2017. After her return, she went back into sex work in the capital San Salvador, where she was eventually kidnapped and beaten, according to her close friend Virginia Flores. She died in hospital on February 3.“We demand that the authorities investigate, clear up the case and find those responsible, regardless of who they are,” Rainbow Trans director Monica Linares told Reuters.El Salvador's security authorities did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Thousands of Central Americans each year cross Mexico to reach the United States, fleeing violence and poverty, despite high rejection rates in U.S. courts and more recent measures by the Trump administration designed to stop them.“[U.S. authorities] forced her to sign [her deportation letter] and she signed, but she did not know what she signed because it was in English,” Ms. Flores told Reuters.Members of the LGBTQ community have been fleeing high rates of persecution in their home countries.Three transgender women have been murdered in El Salvador this year, according to rights groups. In 2018, they reported a total of 19 homicides.In neighboring Honduras, 97 trans women have been killed since 2009, and 303 people murdered for their sexual orientation since 2009, according to Cattrachas, a Honduran-based LGBTQ-rights organization.Those statistics, rights workers and researchers say, likely undercount the number who are murdered or injured as targets of hate crimes in Central America.Along with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have among the highest national homicide rates in the Americas."

Our fight is not against Kashmiris, says the Prime Minister at a rally in Rajasthan’s Tonk district.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Breaking his silence on incidents of Kashmiris being targeted in several parts of India in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday denounced the violence and said that attacking people from the Kashmir Valley would amount to playing into the hands of terrorists. “Our fight is for Kashmir, not against Kashmiris,” Mr. Modi said.Addressing a public rally in Tonk, 100 km from here, where he kicked off the party’s Lok Sabha election campaign in Rajasthan, Mr. Modi said the incidents of violence against Kashmiri youth, whether small or big, should not have happened.“Kashmiris [themselves] are victims of terrorism. Every child of Kashmir is with India in our fight against terror. Incidents like these give power to the Bharat ke tukde honge gang,” Mr. Modi asserted.He said it was the responsibility of “every Indian” to protect the Kashmiris.Civil rights activists and two former judges of the Rajasthan High Court had on Friday expressed concern over Mr. Modi’s silence on the harassment of Kashmiris, while pointing out that the Kashmiri students and workers employed in the State had been forced to leave in a “hostile atmosphere” created by right-wing groups.Mr. Modi paid homage to the CRPF personnel killed in the February 14 terror attack and said while a “free hand” had been given to the Armed Forces to deal with the situation, stern action was being taken against separatists.‘Settling scores’“All scores will be settled this time... Our security forces sent the perpetrators [of Pulwama attack] within 100 hours to where they belonged,” he said, referring to an encounter in which the attack’s alleged mastermind, Abdul Rasheed Ghazi, was killed.“Your Pradhan Sevak is busy fighting terror. I am going to put locks to the factories of terror,” he said, as the crowd at Tonk’s Saadat Pavilion Ground cheered and clapped.The Tonk Assembly constituency is represented by Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, who had defeated the BJP’s Yunus Khan in the 2018 election.Mr. Modi said he had asked Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in his congratulatory phone call last year to fight together against poverty and illiteracy.“Mr. Khan told me that he was the son of a Pathan and was pledged to do what he said... It is time to test his words,” he said."

The author, mathematician, personal trainer who doesn’t believe in smart phones ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Ashok Ferrey writes short stories and novels. He studied mathematics at Oxford, and worked in London on construction sites before returning to Colombo, where he continues to build houses and also works as a personal trainer. He spent his childhood in Somalia, which he describes as “staggeringly beautiful,” but has not returned for fear that the country has changed too much. He came to writing at 42, after his father’s illness with cancer. He loves dogs, avoids talking about mathematics at literary festivals, and doesn’t believe in smart phones. His latest novel isThe Ceaseless Chatter of Demons.Excerpts from an interview:You began writing as a reaction to grief but you’re known as a comic writer...That’s the strange thing. WhenColpetty Peoplecame out, it was what you call a sleeper hit. People would stop me on the street and say, ‘I laughed and laughed’. And I thought, hang on a minute, are we talking about the same book here? To me it’s not a funny book. I can recognise there’s humour there, but I don’t write to make people laugh. It’s a by-product.You’ve said that Sri Lankans are the most complicated people in the world. Why?There have been so many influences. It’s been a colony for over 400 years, colonised by not just one country but three. We have so many different religions. So does India, but in Sri Lanka it’s all concentrated in a very small area. We also have the tropical island mentality, where there is no urgency to do any work or better yourself. Money does not motivate us. Time and again I have foreigners asking me how can we motivate our workers, and actually there’s nothing you can do, short of being mother, brother, father, sister to them. So all these factors combine, and you have this complex people who will never tell you want they want or mean. They’re too polite on one hand, and shy. But they will resent you if you don’t understand what they want at the same time.I’ve also noticed that while everyone seems very jolly, there’s an underlying violence…Yes, there is a passive-aggressiveness that comes from the authorities, who don’t let us laugh or express ourselves. Maybe it’s also in our nature. I always give this example: If your neighbour plucks a jackfruit from your tree that’s on his boundary, and he’s been plucking it for years, I will never say anything. For years, I will tolerate it. I will go to his house and smile sweetly. I will never mention the jackfruit that he plucks from tree on my side of the border. One day, years later, I will take a knife from the kitchen drawer and stab him. You know? And that is not by any means an Ashok Ferrey exaggeration. It happens all the time. It’s in the newspapers.In terms of publishing, do you think Sri Lanka feels a bit overpowered by India, or is there a sense of a thriving, independent voice in English language literature?India is 20 years ahead of us. I’ll probably be shot at home for saying this, but facts must be faced. India has a big population, and so there’s a critical mass of readers. We probably have a critical mass in Sinhala and Tamil, but not in English, so your poor author sits there writing almost in spite of himself. He has other jobs but he feels a compulsion to write but there aren’t enough people to buy his books. There’s no machinery of marketing, publicists, editors, proof readers.How comfortable are you with solitude?My wife will say I’m not comfortable. That I relish all this pizzazz and going out. I think it’s the other way round. If you saw me at a lit fest in the author’s lounge, I just sit by myself. Whereas my wife will happily stalk a famous author… Quite often at these big gatherings I zone out. But physical solitude I’m not so good at. I get bored sitting in a room. If I had a book inside me though I wouldn’t be bored at all.Have you ever gotten in trouble in Sri Lanka for your writing?Oh, quite a lot. For all the wrong reasons. One woman at a café said very sniffily, ‘I must say, your biceps are far better than your writing.’ Then there was another newspaper editor who wrote a vitriolic piece about me only because some shirtmaker had invited a few men in Colombo to turn up as male icons in black tie. The poor editor saw this and went berserk. ‘Arm candy in his Yves Saint Laurent jacket,’ he wrote. Actually, it was an Oxfam dinner jacket for 5 quid. So I do piss people off for the wrong reasons, which is why I try to keep the various careers separate, because I think Sri Lanka is a deeply feudal place where a writer is a lowly creature and must not get above himself.The interviewee’s latest book isGirls Are Coming Out Of The Woods."

Failure to address this will turn aspirational young India into angry young India, says film-maker Rahul Rawail ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Noted film-maker Rahul Rawail, whose filmArjunwas one of the prominent films of the 80s on unemployed youth and their frustrations, said that not much changed in the unemployment scene even now.During an interaction with the delegates and media at the ongoing 11th edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival (Biffes), Rawail said, “WhileArjundealt with the problem of unemployment through violence, Zoya Akhtar’sGully Boylooks to rap music to tackle it. The failure to address this issue will turn an aspirational young India into an angry young India.”The director did not mince words when criticising the ‘star culture’ in the film industry. He said that only content-driven films would succeed at the box office.“Stars are always secondary. It is content that matters. Look at the performances of Vicky Kaushal and Ayushmann Khurrana. They have succeeded because of their talents. Legacy will not help somebody become an actor,” said Mr. Rawail, who launched the careers of Sunny Deol and Kumar Gaurav. “Working with newcomers is a really wonderful experience,” he added. Mr. Rawail was also instrumental in introducing Paresh Rawal inArjun.Batting strongly for regional films, Mr. Rawail said, “I am opposed to terming Hindi films as Bollywood films. They are Hindi films, like there are Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Marathi films. There is nothing like a ‘regional film’. I sawKGF Chapter-1.It is a brilliantly-made film. It proved that content is key.” Recalling that he had watched Puttanna Kanagal films, he added, “Puttanna sir is a brilliant film-maker.”He said that film education was needed to understand how to break rules. “You should know the rules to break them,” he said.Mr. Rawail defended the All India Cine Workers’ Association’s decision of a blanket ban on Pakistani artistes in the Indian film industry. He said the ban was one way of condemning the Pulwama attack. He said the industry’s decision was in response to the country’s heinous crimes against humanity. He emphasised upon the need for a long-term political solution to the issue of Kashmir."
Master printmaker-sculptor Krishna Reddy’s works are on show in Kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/master-printmaker-sculptor-krishna-reddys-works-are-on-show-in-kolkata/article26341016.ece,"
Reddy’s prints appeal both to our visual and haptic senses
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Whirls and eddies and bombardments of subtle but striking colours embossed on a paper surface reflect the mysterious process of germination and birthing in nature, and myriad other experiences, in the works of Krishna Reddy (1925–2018), master printmaker, teacher and sculptor.It was at Santiniketan that the seeds of this sensibility were planted, when Nandalal Bose —mastermoshaito his students — taught Reddy to wait patiently until nature took him in her embrace. And it would find mature expression in the intaglio prints of Reddy, who in the mid-1950s, alongside British artist Stanley William Hayter and Kaiko Moti (Kaikobad Motiwala) of Bombay, developed the process of colour viscosity printing, a breakthrough in intaglio printing, at Atelier 17, Hayter’s legendary workshop in Paris. Reddy’s prints are being exhibited in Kolkata at Experimenter’s current show, To a New Form (January 18 – March 31)Reddy was born to farmhands in an Andhra village, although his father also made sculptures for the local temple. Unlettered until 10 or 11, Reddy displayed a flair for painting deities. His first teacher was the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, and he was sent to Santiniketan, aged 16, in 1943, the year of the Bengal famine. In Kolkata, he would help cremate the bodies of famine victims — his first lessons in anatomy, he would later comment. And he found his mentors, Bose and Ramkinkar Baij, at Santiniketan.To a New Form sculpture by Krishna Reddy.  
| Photo Credit:ExperimenterBut Reddy sailed to London in 1949, and through the good offices of Krishnamurti, joined the Slade, where he trained under Henry Moore and Lucian Freud. He moved to Paris in 1951, where he was apprenticed to the Russian artist Ossip Zadkine. Next came Hayter’s Atelier 17; Reddy became its co-director in 1965. In later days , he used to recount how all the stars of Parisienne Bohemia would gather in a “small street”, where he encountered Constantin Giacometti and Alberto Brancusi.He was in Paris for two decades, but frequently visited America, where he settled down permanently in 1976 and established the Color Print Atelier. Besides being a celebrated artist, Reddy had made a name for himself as a teacher, with teaching posts at prestigious universities. No wonder his studio stacked with printing tools and plates drew students from all over the world. He may have worked abroad for the better part of his life, but Reddy never forsook the legacy of Santiniketan.Among the many pleasures of observing Reddy’s prints is that they appeal both to our visual and haptic senses. What enhances the appeal of this exhibition is the display of the deeply-furrowed original copper and zinc plates that bear a direct impression of Reddy’s creative energies. He used these for printmaking, and the corresponding prints are also on show.Sculpture was Reddy’s favourite medium of expression, and when he prepared these metal plates for printmaking, he followed a method akin to relief sculpting, gouging and incising the metallic surface till it was left with a fine network of gorges and trenches that formed the image — the first step towards making prints that bear the polychromatic Reddy hallmark. The same plate was covered with multiple colour inks of different thickness or viscosity and pressed on paper to produce an image in a range of amazing shades. The image itself appeared in low relief on the paper surface, not unlike the raised welts on alligator skin.Maternity print by Krishna Reddy.  
| Photo Credit:ExperimenterIn an interview for an online journal in 2016, Reddy said: “...Starting in the early 50s I worked on a series of prints, which were built up as I used burins and scrapers and they became like sculptures...I used mostly hand tools but later on I also began to use machine tools..”He maintained that “Geometry is the clay with which I build my pot.” His early prints displayed here demonstrate how he established a sense of order on the chaos of creation through a strong sense of structure and harmony, be it in the blooming flowers, spider webs, whirlpools, the seedling pushing its way to sunlight, the tragi-comicGreat Clown, theWoman of Sunflower, orViolence and Sorrow, with images that veer between the figurative and abstraction. This is his “insight into the mysterious sources and inner workings of reality”, whittling a form down to its essence.Reddy declared: “I draw all the time. It is the lifeline of an artist.” In his series of drawings from doodles and squiggles to full figures, the underlying principles of his sculptures and the influence of Ramkinkar’s dymanism become apparent. In 1942, he made posters in support of Gandhi, and in Paris he did the same for the defiant Algerians, for which he was arrested several times. During the 1968 student uprising, Reddy made Demonstration, a print series featuring protesters with raised arms, and sculptures of the same name.Hayter once commented that Reddy’s “...earliest sculptures manifestly convey the feeling of torque and torsion”. And this is articulated through his drawings and the tortuousTo A New Form, which Reddy cast in plaster in Paris in 1968, and which he recast in bronze at the Modern Art Foundry, New York, in 2017.It’s perhaps no coincidence that Rabindranath’s words about Nandalal Bose — “...to him art is a living matter. He knows it through his vision and through empathy...” — are as applicable to the student as to the master.The writer focuses on Kolkata’s vanishing heritage and culture."

",,"Condemning the murders of two Youth Congress workers in Kasaragod, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the incident has created a situation favourable for discrediting the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government that has been performing well.Addressing a public meeting after laying the foundation stone of the new district committee office of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) at Kasaragod on Friday, Mr. Vijayan said party State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s quick condemnation of the double murders on the very first day itself made clear the party’s stand. Terming the murders a senseless act committed by some people, he said that the killing could not be justified by any means.Directive to policeThe CPI(M) should not be held responsible for such acts of crime. The party would not protect those involved, and the police had been asked to take strict action. Law would take its course without partiality, he added. He said that the incidents of violence that followed the murders should also be condemned. The State wanted peace and the government would fight all kinds of violence, he added.Mr. Vijayan said that when CPI(M) workers were murdered or attacked, the media did not take the incidents seriously. The reputation of the party was not dependent of the media, he said. The party considered common people as its masters. “Bowing before the people, we would say that the government wants to maintain law and order.”Rumours of visitIt was rumoured in the morning that Mr. Vijayan might visit the houses of the two slain men, though the visit was not included in the official schedule. According to reports, the plan was dropped after the district unit of the Congress objected, saying that party workers might protest. District Congress Committee president Hakkim Kunnil said the Congress district leadership was not contacted by the CPI(M) leadership or the Chief Minister’s Office regarding the visit. “If he wanted to visit the houses, he could have done so like Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan,” he said.When Mr. Vijayan returned to Kanhangad, the Kerala Students Union and Youth Congress workers waved black flags at him at Poyinachi. KSU district president Noyal Tomin Joseph and Youth Congress district vice president Sreejith Madakkal were among those arrested for waving black flags."

‘87% would have studied on, not married’ ",,"Girls are forced into marriage for want of access to education closer home, a study has found.The study, conducted among women in the 19-25 age group in 10 districts by the Samakalvi Iyakkam, found that girls had to marry as higher secondary schools were located far, sometimes as much as 22 km away from their homes.The child rights organisation took a sample of 210 girls, all dropouts and married before they turned 18, and found that 50% of them had dropped out after Class VIII and another 48% after classes IXand X.Eighty per cent of the respondents were not aware of the legal age of marriage for girls, though they knew about some of the government initiatives such as anganwadi, the mother and child protection card and government scholarships.Age differenceAt least 10 girls were married to men aged 35 years and 60% of the respondents’ husbands were aged between 26 and 30 at the time of marriage.What shocked the activists was that as much as 17% of them lived in broken homes after marriage as they were either abandoned by their husbands or had left due to domestic violence. “The aim was to understand the impact of early marriage on the health of the women. We found that 30.5% of the girls had complicated deliveries leading to poor health. Nearly 75% of the respondents experienced frequent abortions,” said Chella Selvakumar, general secretary. Activists said the respondents wanted the legal age for marriage raised to 21 years. They recommend that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, be suitably amended.“We found that 89% of the respondents were interested in studying and 87% said they wouldn’t have married had there been a higher secondary school. There are 12,450 panchayats and each of them should have a higher secondary school,” said Christuraj, State coordinator.“Instead of providing freebies, the government should focus on improving infrastructure in schools and build classrooms and toilets. Parents fear for their daughters’ safety and hence don’t send their daughters to schools,” Mr. Selvakumar said."

Police in Papua sparked outrage this month after officers draped a snake around the neck of a suspect to persuade him to confess to petty theft.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"United Nations rights experts have urged Indonesia to investigate accusations of violence by police and military in Papua after a video showed officers using a live snake to intimidate a suspect during questioning.Reports of human rights abuses by security forces often trickle out of the easternmost region of Papua, where a separatist movement has simmered for decades.The former Dutch colony, the resource-rich western part of New Guinea island, was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969.“We urge the government to take urgent measures to prevent the excessive use of force by police and military officials involved in law enforcement in Papua,” the experts said.“We are also deeply concerned about what appears to be a culture of impunity and general lack of investigations into allegations of human rights violations in Papua,” they said in a statement.Papuans had been treated in “cruel, inhuman and degrading” ways, added the experts, who include several special rapporteurs on indigenous and human rights.A spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment.Police in Papua sparked outrage this month after officers draped a snake around the neck of a suspect to persuade him to confess to petty theft.A video circulated online showed a man being questioned about stolen mobile phones while seated with his hands tethered behind his back, yelling in distress as an officer pushed a snake towards his face.The national police have since apologised and pledged disciplinary action.The case reflected “a widespread pattern of violence, alleged arbitrary arrests and detention, as well as methods amounting to torture used by the Indonesian police and military in Papua,” the experts added.President Joko Widodo, who is up for re-election in April, has pledged to develop Papua, Indonesia's poorest region, but faces criticism for not doing enough to invstigate accusations of rights abuses by security forces there."

Since September, the sisters have changed location 13 times, fearing for their safety, Mr. Vidler said.
",,"Two sisters from Saudi Arabia were intercepted at Hong Kong airport by the kingdom's diplomats en route to Australia, their lawyer said, the year's second high-profile case of Saudi women trying to flee what they call repression at home.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is visiting Beijing on a tour of Asia just a month after a Saudi woman hit global headlines by barricading herself in a Bangkok airport hotel to avoid being sent home to her family.“These brave, young, intelligent women have been living in fear, in hiding and in legal limbo in Hong Kong, not knowing what their future holds,” their lawyer, Michael Vidler, said in a statement on Thursday.They hoped to find a third country “place of safety” as soon as possible, he added.The pair, who have renounced their Muslim faith, arrived in the Chinese territory in September 2018 after fleeing a family holiday in Sri Lanka and had booked a connecting flight to Australia, Mr. Vidler said.But the sisters, aged 18 and 20, whose identity Mr. Vidler did not reveal, were intercepted by officials during their stopover in the Asian financial hub, before they managed to escape and enter the city as visitors, he said.The women, who have been in hiding in the former British colony for the last five months, told the lawyer their connecting flight to Australia was cancelled and the officials tried to put them on a flight to the Saudi capital of Riyadh.Mr. Vidler said the sisters learnt that the officials who intercepted them were Saudi Arabia's consul general and vice consul general in Hong Kong, but did not explain how they came by the information.The Saudi consulate in Hong Kong did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on Friday.“We fled our home to ensure our safety,” the women said in the statement.“We hope that we can be given asylum in a country which recognises women's rights and treats them as equals. We dream of being in a safe place where we can be normal young women, free from violence and oppression.”Since September, the sisters have changed location 13 times, fearing for their safety, Mr. Vidler said.In November, the Hong Kong Immigration Department told them their Saudi passports had been invalidated and they could only stay in the city until February 28.Police in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said only that they had received a report from “two expatriate women” and were investigating, but did not elaborate.The Hong Kong Immigration Department said it would not comment on individual cases.The incident, and the January case of the barricaded 18-year-old, since granted asylum in Canada, spotlights Saudi Arabia's strict social rules that require women to secure travel permission from a male “guardian”, which rights groups say can leave them trapped as prisoners of abusive families.Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of a journalist at its Istanbul consulate in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen."

The same event also witnessed the death of a cow (only bulls are permitted in Erudhattams) tripping over its leash in the arena of an illegal Erudhattam.Similarly, on Wednesday, mob violence broke out in Denkanikottai, when the police attempted to disperse a crowd that had attempted to unleash bulls without permission for Erudhattam during the course of a temple festival.Against this backdrop,The Hinduspoke to S.K. Mittal, Chairman, Jallikattu Inspection Committee, Government of India, who was visiting here to review the conduct of the Erudhattam as per the mandate of the Animal Welfare Board of India.“In Tamil Nadu, from January 14 starting from Pongal to May, over 19 districts conduct these events. I have so far toured 16 districts since then, and by far, the administrations in these districts are monitoring the events,” said Dr. Mittal.The mandate of the AWBI is that tradition and rituals shall be followed, but (traditions and rituals) will be free from cruelty and pain and under the guidelines of the Supreme Court of India. “We are not against tradition. Our job is to monitor that guidelines are followed.”Asked if the committee of the AWBI had taken cognizance of the incidents that saw animal fatalities and violations, Dr. Mittal, said, “there have been three troubling incidents. I held internal meetings with the officials and the police. In one of the incidents, there has been an intelligence failure on the part of the police.”Alluding to the Rayakottai incident, where permission was denied by the district administration, but the police had watched over the assembly of crowd to witness the Erudhattam, he said the information regarding denial of permission was not communicated. “People had gathered not knowing that permission was cancelled. The information was not conveyed,” said the Chairman of the Jallikattu Monitoring Committee.But, according to Dr. Mittal, lot of improvements will be seen. “From the next event, either the event will not be permitted, and if permission is given, then the officials will have to own the responsibility for the adherence to the conditions (guidelines for conduct of the Erudhattam).”According to him, the administration was also acting decisively against mischief-mongers.Earlier, Dr. Mittal held a review meeting with Collector Dr. S. Prabhakar, Superintendent of Police Bandi Gangadhar and other officials."

The book mentions some cases I dealt with and highlights certain problems faced by Judges while hearing them. Sometimes it is an archaic provision of law, the absence of a law, or defining what is public policy and what is not, and often the cases have to stand the test of reasonableness.”Talking about the book, Ms. Manohar said, “Many times the judiciary has tried to fill the void in the law. The book truly talks about essential chapters like, case management, adoption, mediation or conciliation, arbitration, conduct of lawyers and others.”Ms. Dalvi has been a Judge at the Bombay City Civil and Sessions Court and a principal Judge at the Family Court before becoming a Judge at the HC.

‘Uncurated content on free platforms may incite ethnic and religious divisions’
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"India should be on guard against foreign powers focused on undermining Indian democracy by promoting their own agenda on the social media during the forthcoming general elections, said Andrew Keen, British-American author and broadcaster known for his highly critical view of the current Internet culture.Talking toThe Hinduon the sidelines of the 44th World Congress of International Advertising Association here on Wednesday, Mr. Keen said that India, which had been historically riven by ethnic and religious divisions and the dark forces they unleashed, was very vulnerable to incitement through the Internet.He observed that the majority of Indians did not possess the sophistication to distinguish between propaganda and credible news. While the quality of life was improving and the economy changing drastically, many Indians did not have the disposable income to pay for monthly content, making them vulnerable to uncurated content on free social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook, Mr. Keen remarked.“India is a country where passions can run high and social media lends itself to such passionate outpouring of emotions. For all these reasons, India is very prone to the kind of fake news and hysteria that corrupted the last U.S. elections and undermined the democratic forces,” he said.Mr. Keen warned against the exploitation of the social media platforms for inciting communal hatred, citing how they were used in the U.S. and Europe by racists, neo-Nazis and elements opposed to women, children, Jews and blacks. He said that the rise of right wing populist parties in the U.S. and Brexit in the U.K. were no coincidences.“Internet is a highly dangerous platform that can accentuate ethnic, religious and gender animosities. It’s not an enlightening platform but lends itself to segregation,” Mr. Keen said.He said that Canadian Philosopher Marshall McLuhan’s prophecy of electronic media being a global village had come true, albeit ironically, with the Internet compounding the hypocrisy and parochialism associated with village life.Drawing attention to his latest bookHow to Fix the Future, Mr. Keen called for a much more regulated regime to control Internet-based platforms. “These platforms need to be made accountable for the lies and hatred they publish. The Europeans have already begun it with the Germans even handing out financial punishments every time something illegal is published over these platforms,” he said.Mr. Keen urged consumers to be more demanding and quit platforms that propagate violence and hatred."

Holding a mirror to war,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/holding-a-mirror-to-war/article26333193.ece,"
The technology of warfare has evolved, but grief and loss remain ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In the aftermath of thesuicide bombing in Pulwama districton February 14, which killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel, war seems to be on the collective mind of the nation with some baying for blood and others cautioning restraint.Few words in the English language evoke such powerful emotions: patriotism and glory, love and hate, fear and anger, hope and despair. For centuries, poets have borne witness to the strife that humans have inflicted upon themselves since the birth of civilisation. Just as the technology of warfare has evolved from spears to drones, the tenor of war poems has changed too.The Iliad, one of the oldest war poems, glorifies heroes. It begins, not with the abduction of Helen that sparked the battle of Troy, but with the wrath of Achilles. It ends, not with the rape of Troy, but the death of another hero, Hector. In ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade,’ Alfred Tennyson flogs the motif of heroism in the 1854 Battle of Balaclava: as the cavalry rides into the valley of Death knowing that someone had blundered, theirs was not to reason why, “theirs but to do and die”.World War I poetry began on a patriotic note too, but soldier-poets — half buried in the trenches and witness to the slaughter that their generals had sent them to — began to revolt. Wilfred Owen upended the Roman poet Horace’s view of patriotism: “My friend, you would not tell with such high zest/To children ardent for some desperate glory,/The old Lie:Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori[It is sweet and fitting to die for one’s country]”.Even for the triumphant, the battlefield is a place that births nightmares. In the poem, ‘The King Speaks to the Scribe,’ by Keki N. Daruwalla, Emperor Ashoka contemplates the cost of his victory at Kalinga: “The battlefield stank so that heaven/had to hold a cloth to its nose. I trod/this plain, dark and glutinous with gore,/my chariot-wheels squelching in the bloody mire.”By World War II, the instruments used in battle had changed. Planes and submarines provided distance from the violence, drowning out the agony of the dying. Today, drones have dehumanised war into video games. The heroism and horror in war poetry has given way to cynicism, satire, and alienation.One emotion, however, remains unchanged: loss. Achilles mourned the death of his best friend. The World War I poets mourned the loss of innocence. Sarojini Naidu, in her 1915 poem, ‘The Gift of India’, gives voice to the motherland who grieves for the soldiers that have been torn from her breast to the “drum-beats of duty sabres.” Hatred may fuel a war, but what remains is loss and grief. Our failure to acknowledge this by allowing the narrative to be taken over by an army of trolls is a disservice to the nation. As Mr. Daruwalla writes in ‘At War’: “...haven’t we enough on our plate/without having to think of war/and blood-stained jehad?”The writer is with The Hindu’s Bengaluru bureau"

Chennithala writes to CM seeking CBI probe into murders
",,"The United Democratic Front (UDF) on Thursday stepped up pressure on the Pinarayi Vijayan government with a demand for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a probe into the role of Udma legislator K. Kunhiraman into the killing of two Youth Congress leaders.The Congress party also organised a meeting of cultural personalities, mainly those opposed to Left parties, to condemn the cult of political violence.The CPI(M) leadership promptly disowned the main accused A. Peethambaran, but the main Opposition coalition had made it clear that it would not be taken in by the current probe.It is in this context that Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala shot off a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan asking him to hand over the investigation to the CBI.He said the Kerala police had failed to crack the murders days after it took place, including the angle of conspiracy of local CPI(M) leaders. The government’s reshuffling of the police team has also given rise to suspicion about the real motives of the LDF government, he said.In Kottayam, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran demanded a probe into the role of Mr. Kunhiraman against the backdrop of the allegations made by the father of Sarath Lal, one of the Youth Congress leaders who was killed."

Five others were absconding.The rioting broke out on Wednesday here at a temple festival, when the police made a bid to disperse a 1000 strong crowd, after a mob unleashed bulls for Erudhattam.The district administration had denied permission for the conduct of Erudhattam during the Venkatesan Swamy temple car festival. The village temple committee had made an undertaking that no Erudhattam would be organised at the venue. Based on this, the crowd was permitted to assemble. However, a mob unleashed bulls in violation, forcing the skeletal police force at the venue to intervene. The mob hurled stones at the police injuring many. Police jeeps and a fire service vehicle was destroyed. Following this, police companies were deployed at the venue. Curiously, the police FIR does not record the destruction of police jeeps. The FIR has named the accused for destruction of fire service vehicle and attacking fire and rescue personnel."

Urban effect in Andhra Pradesh is spread across districts, says expert
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Andhra Pradesh stands fourth behind Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in achieving national targets set for 13 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.According to the NITI Aayog’s SDG Index India - Baseline Report, 2018, released in December, the State, along with Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra has secure a composite score of 64 as against the national average of 57, with a perfect score signifying achievement of the targets.The report tracks the progress of the States and the Union Territories across 62 indicators, identified for the goals, and ranks them based on the average of normalised scores achieved by them in reaching the targets set for each indicator.The report notes that the State has just 9.2% of its population below the poverty line as against the national average of 21.92% and has achieved the target. With every three of four households having at least one member under health insurance or a health scheme, the State tops the country in health coverage, buttressing its efforts in ending poverty.As for eliminating hunger, it has fared abysmally in its public distribution system (PDS) coverage for poor households.With a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 74, it is behind Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu in achieving the target.In having quality education, it is third with 98.1% of its school teachers professionally qualified as against the national average of 81.15%.Gender equalityHowever, 45.2% of women have said they have faced domestic violence, the third highest after Manipur and Telangana, slowing its march towards gender equality.In achieving decent work and economic growth, it is second to Goa as it has reached the target for the annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate per capita and all its households have bank accounts.But with very poor road connectivity in rural areas under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna and with the Bharat Net yet to reach the hinterland, the State is one of the worst performers in industry, innovation and infrastructure.The State, at 12.04%, has the largest chunk of urban households living in slums. And though almost all the wards have door-to-door waste collection facility, only 7% of waste is processed placing it last but third in fostering sustainable cities and communities.Yet the State has the second strongest institutions after Himachal Pradesh. There are an estimated 31.4 courts per 10 lakh persons, which has achieved the target for the number of reported corruption crimes as well.The State is ahead of Telangana in reaching eight of the 13 goals.“This is because Telangana has faced skewed urbanisation centred on Hyderabad. Whereas in Andhra Pradesh, urban effect is scattered across districts,” says U.S. Mishra, professor at the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram.Urban slumsMore urban slums have mushroomed, which, according to Mr. Mishra could be linked to increased infrastructure activity post-bifurcation that led to mobility among people who set up temporary settlements.The report lauds the State for being among the seven having a budgetary component targeting the SDGs. “Many indicators, including those linked to nutrition, are outcome based and could show improvement through policy interventions,” says Mr. Mishra.As for overcoming the last-mile challenges faced by the performing States, Mr. Mishra says: “When States perform well, there is a fear of adversity getting pocketed. Meaning, a particular group is disadvantaged.Therefore more effort is needed and inclusive and equitable development could propel a State towards the goals.”"

Kunhiraman of having had beforehand knowledge of the killings of two Youth Congress workers in Periya in Kasaragod on February 14 night.He told journalists that the MLA from Uduma had absented himself from the festival committee meeting of the local Kalliyootu Bhagavathy Temple on the evening of the killings. Mr. Kunhiraman headed the committee in which the slain youth, Kripesh and Sarath Lal, were also members.The men were killed on their way back home from the meeting that the MLA was scheduled to attend but did not at the last moment. The CPM Kasaragod district secretary, who was supposed to attend the committee meeting, also absented himself unusually.Mr. Chennithala also raised the possibility that a set of spotters could have tailed the youth from the temple. He said they could have helped the hit-men, possibly experienced killers from a CPM stronghold in Kannur, who were lying in wait with sharp-edged weapons to target the youth accurately.Mr. Chennithala attempted to pick holes in the police enquiry by stating that theaccused CPM local committee member, A. Peethambaran, could not organise or execute the killings on his own.The CPM had tried to make a scapegoat of Peethambaran, who had lost the use of his right hand recently in political violence, to save the real ring leaders.His wife had stated as much and rejected the police narrativethat her husband was a drug addict and had committed the crime under its influence.Mr. Chennithala said the ""broken and rusted sword and two iron rods"" the police had recovered from an abandoned well were possibly planted there as misleading evidence and not the real weapons used for the crime.The Opposition leader said that the conduct of CPM leaders before and after the crime was suspicious. He added that the former Uduma MLA had visited the family of the suspect and offered them cash to remain silent after the CPM expelled Peethambaram from the party.A cabal of pliant officers and CPM leaders have plotted to protect the real accused in the case, Mr. Chennithala said, reiterating his demand for a CBI enquiry."

Prof. Shoma Sen’s daughter talks to The Hindu about her mother’s work for the betterment of the country, and the anger at hearing her being called anti-national
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It has been over 250 days since Professor Shoma Sen, a reputed academician, has been lodged in the largest prison in Maharashtra, Yerwada Central Jail, for her alleged involvement in the Bhima-Koregaon violence. The court is currently hearing her second bail plea, after rejecting the first application on November 2, 2018, noting that the material collected prima facie reveals her involvement in alleged unlawful activities inimical to the country’s security.Talking to The Hindu, Prof. Sen’s daughter, filmmaker Koel Sen, repeats her mother’s words: “They can keep me locked inside, but my mind is completely free!” Ms. Sen talks about the day that changed the fate of her family when her mother, now 60, was arrested on June 6, 2018. The Pune Police landed up at their house at 6 a.m., without a search warrant, and left 10 hours later with her mother. Prof. Sen, the then head of the English department at Nagpur University, was slated to retire in July 2018 and had plans to celebrate her 60th birthday in August that year. Ms. Sen talks about how the second-oldest university in the State suspended her mother and blocked her salary account, and how a teacher for 38 years was charged under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Edited excerpts.What is your memory of June 6, 2018?I was at my place in Mumbai, and for some reason my phone was unreachable. It was a network issue. I am sure that my mom must have been trying to call me, but couldn’t get through. I still feel terrible about that. I reached my workplace at 11 a.m. and found out on the internet while browsing through the news. I was first shocked! I couldn’t believe that it could be my mother. I tried calling her number, but it was switched off. I then realised there was something wrong. Then I found out about the raid from my mother’s lawyer friend, who told me [the police] are probably going to arrest her. I still couldn’t believe what I had heard. I was panicking and frantically trying to call our domestic helper, who was the only person [I could] contact.Later, when I heard the entire story from my father, it was appalling. The Pune Police had planned to make it appear like a big crackdown. Almost 150 police personnel from Pune and Nagpur were designated for this task. They surrounded our house, and spread across the lanes outside our building and our neighbourhood in Nagpur. The police had entered to raid our house flashing a letter from one of the Pune ACPs. They did not have any search warrant. My parents were cornered into one room and the police behaved terribly with them. They were not allowed to eat or drink anything or to even go to the kitchen. They were asked to leave the washroom door open when they needed to use it. My parents are in their sixties and my mother has arthritis! The raid went on from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. till they flew my mother to Pune, without a remand notice from the nearest district magistrate. It is almost an illegal arrest of the same nature in which they tried to pick up [Professor] Anand Teltumbde recently from Mumbai airport. All of this has led to a lot of defamation for my mother who has been a reputed academician for 32 years in Nagpur.Prof. Sen was brought up in Bandra so why did she decide to move to Nagpur?Maagrew up in Bandra, studied in St. Joseph’s School and later went to Elphinstone College. She was attracted to social work at a very early age. There are some people who are very sensitive to their immediate surroundings. MyMaais one of them. I remember my grandfather telling me that when she was very young,Maawould often say that when she grew older, she would do everything to stop poverty. She cannot see the look in the eyes of the beggars on the streets. That’s how she started teaching at a very young age.Soon afterMaacompleted college, she taught at Ruparel College, Dadar, in the early 80s.Maafelt that education was the first step at creating an equal society. She dedicated her life to teaching the underprivileged. Even at home, when we had a domestic helper working at our house,Maawould make sure that she would take some time out to help the maid with her domestic problems, help her with educating her children. This is my mother’s nature, she sometimes goes out of the way to help people.Life in Mumbai was getting very hectic and expensive. My grandfather had left their rented Bandra house and moved back to Kolkata.Maaalso felt that there is a need to spread education in the smaller, more underdeveloped parts of Maharashtra, especially where there is complete lack of infrastructure for education. That’s why she chose Nagpur. She started teaching at PWS (People’s Welfare Society) College of Arts and Commerce in Nagpur where there was a predominantly Dalit community of students coming to study. My mother’s students who had enrolled in B.A English could not even spell the basic English vocabulary. She would start teaching them English right from scratch. This is the kind of dedication and sincerity that my mother has towards her work as an academician and as professor of English.You have seen your mother help and change lives of others. It must be very tough to see her in this position.Yes, it’s extremely tough. She does not deserve this. [It has] just been an unending nightmare for me and my family. We feel so helpless and powerless. We cannot do anything to get her out of this misery. But we know that we will overcome all of this soon. As we have seen throughout history, [those] who do good for society and its people are never in the good books of politicians and the government … what the present government is doing to my mother is nothing less than a criminal act. Today, our country is seeing its worst time after Independence.Do you think that voices of dissent are being suppressed today?I am not even an activist so to say. I make films. But someone like me who is so remotely associated with any kind of political activism is also getting affected so gravely — that says something. It says that our society is dangerously turning into an extreme right-wing state.When we see propagandist films likeUriandThe Accidental Prime Ministerget mainstream theatre releases, this is something we need to worry about. If Naseeruddin Shah gets targeted when he expresses his concern about the country that he loves so much, this is something we need to worry about. The present government is behaving so insecurely, and targeting each and every single dissenting individual with vengeance, that there is absolutely no space for even a simple dialogue, forget dissent.What do you feel when you hear the prosecutor make the argument of your mother being ‘anti-national’.If I tell you honestly what I feel here, I might get targeted too (laughs)! Initially, when I would hear the public prosecutor make the argument of ‘anti-national’ against my mother I would feel a sense of rage and anger mixed with utter frustration. I would question how — HOW — can she even say that? What does she even know about my mother… If nothing else, my mother has given her entire life’s work for the betterment of this country and especially Maharashtra. She is nothing but the exact opposite of an anti-national.But, today, we are seeing that anyone who disagrees with the current government is tagged as anti-national, and anyone who supports the government is a nationalist. So this accusation doesn’t make me angry any more. It is plain stupid.How often are you able to visit her and what keeps her going inside?I visit her quite often, once or twice a month, sometimes even more as Pune is not very far from Mumbai. [We give her] books to read and there is also a jail library.Maahas access to paper and pen so she writes to keep herself occupied. We write each other letters too. She wrote in one of her letters, “They can keep me locked inside, but my mind is completely free!” So of course, hope keeps her going — a hope for justice and freedom.What are your fights and hardships after the incident?Every day has been a fight ever since my mother’s arrest. Soon after her arrest, she was suspended from Nagpur University where she was the head of the English department. The vice-chancellor and registrar are not giving our family any support either; it is the opposite actually. They are making our lives more miserable. Her salary account has been blocked, and there is a housing loan to repay. She was to retire the very next month after her arrest, and her Festschrift was cancelled. Very defamatory planted news articles keep popping up in the newspapers in Nagpur from time to time. People in Nagpur are generally very concerned about my mother, but they are genuinely scared. Many of them who want to talk about it are being asked to keep quiet by their authorities because we all know that Nagpur is also where the root of this government lies. Her colleagues and students are being individually harassed and asked not to speak out against her arrest by supporters of the [Rashtriya Swayamsevak] Sangh.Do you ever ask ‘why us’?Yes I do, all the time. But I also know why it is us. There are very few honest and good people left in this world who are genuinely doing good for society, the country and its people. And this government wants that minuscule number to completely diminish. At this point, I feel that these arrested activists stand as symbols of defiance, much like those who stood up against the emergency. It is no coincidence that those targeted are some of the most well-known human rights activists in this country, and that their names were also published in the Sangh mouthpiece right before their arrests. It tells us that they are scared — scared of their work and their appeal amongst people. It is [an indication] of the caste politics of the Maharashtra government, and its open support to people who are hell-bent on creating a new narrative around incidents that happened centuries ago and should best be left alone. And this is another scary iteration of this party’s strategy to conveniently manufacture evidence whenever they need it, whether its doctored videos, planted letters or fake degrees."

His eardrum had been damaged in the attack.Dr. Sherif was waylaid by the protesters despite they were told that he was on his way to the hospital to attend an emergency case. His vehicle and mobile phone were damaged too. A complaint had been lodged with the local police against the attackers.M.E. Sugathan, president, IMA Kerala chapter, toldThe Hinduon Wednesday that it was the patients who were forced to bear the brunt of hartals.Though organisations always declare that milk distribution, media, and medical fraternity were exempted from the purview of hartals, the situation on the ground seemed to be different.Most often health professionals were found to be at the receiving end of protesters. Dr. Sugathan demanded that the police invoke provisions of the Kerala Health Service Persons and Healthcare Services Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, 2012 against those who attacked Dr. Sherif, which would make their offence non-bailable. It would also act as a deterrent in future, he said."

The video of the shawl seller being attacked by a mob in West Bengal went viral on social media on Wednesday. In the video, which is a little shorter than two minutes, the youth is seen bleeding while several people can be heard shouting at him. While Mr. Khan has not lodged any police complaint, the district police said they are trying to identify the culprits who were not seen in the video. However they could be heard abusing Mr. Khan, who was rescued by the police.Superintendent of Police [SP] of Nadia toldThe Hindu,“The person in the video [Mr. Khan] is absolutely safe. A case has been lodged and one person has been arrested.”Earlier, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah tweeted that he contacted West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the video.“Having seen the video doing the rounds on social media of a young Kashmiri man being beaten up I’ve been in touch with @derekobrienmp & @MamataOfficial regarding the matter. The culprits have been identified & the strongest possible action has been assured,” Mr. Abdullah tweeted later.HeckledIn the other incident in Kolkata, a group of shawl traders from Kashmir were targeted in Behala in the southern parts of the city. Locals said a mob heckled some of them late on Sunday evening. However, the incident surfaced on Wednesday.Prior to this there was report of a doctor from Kashmir being targeted in the city. Soon after talking to Mr. Abdullah, Ms. Banerjee posted on the micro blogging site that political parties are provoking hate.“One section of political parties/groups along with people holding constitutional positions indulging in rumour mongering, spreading hatred with dangerous statements. Even journalists not spared. This is shameless politics,” she tweeted.Meanwhile in parts of north Bengal, many mosque committees organised rallies to condemn the terror attack in Kashmir. They shouted slogans like “Pakistan Murdabad” and distributed leaflets demanding stern action against the neighbouring country.On Tuesday night Jama Masjid of Dinhata in Cooch Behar district took out a rally to maintain peace and to offer prayers to the CRPF personnel killed in last week’s attack."

Urban effect in Andhra Pradesh is spread across districts, says expert
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Andhra Pradesh stands fourth behind Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in achieving national targets set for 13 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.According to the NITI Aayog’s SDG Index India - Baseline Report, 2018, released in December, the State, along with Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra has secure a composite score of 64 as against the national average of 57, with a perfect score signifying achievement of the targets.The report tracks the progress of the States and the Union Territories across 62 indicators, identified for the goals, and ranks them based on the average of normalised scores achieved by them in reaching the targets set for each indicator.The report notes that the State has just 9.2% of its population below the poverty line as against the national average of 21.92% and has achieved the target. With every three of four households having at least one member under health insurance or a health scheme, the State tops the country in health coverage, buttressing its efforts in ending poverty.As for eliminating hunger, it has fared abysmally in its public distribution system (PDS) coverage for poor households.With a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 74, it is behind Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu in achieving the target.In having quality education, it is third with 98.1% of its school teachers professionally qualified as against the national average of 81.15%.Gender equalityHowever, 45.2% of women have said they have faced domestic violence, the third highest after Manipur and Telangana, slowing its march towards gender equality.In achieving decent work and economic growth, it is second to Goa as it has reached the target for the annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate per capita and all its households have bank accounts.But with very poor road connectivity in rural areas under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna and with the Bharat Net yet to reach the hinterland, the State is one of the worst performers in industry, innovation and infrastructure.The State, at 12.04%, has the largest chunk of urban households living in slums. And though almost all the wards have door-to-door waste collection facility, only 7% of waste is processed placing it last but third in fostering sustainable cities and communities.Yet the State has the second strongest institutions after Himachal Pradesh. There are an estimated 31.4 courts per 10 lakh persons, which has achieved the target for the number of reported corruption crimes as well.The State is ahead of Telangana in reaching eight of the 13 goals.“This is because Telangana has faced skewed urbanisation centred on Hyderabad. Whereas in Andhra Pradesh, urban effect is scattered across districts,” says U.S. Mishra, professor at the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram.Urban slumsMore urban slums have mushroomed, which, according to Mr. Mishra could be linked to increased infrastructure activity post-bifurcation that led to mobility among people who set up temporary settlements.The report lauds the State for being among the seven having a budgetary component targeting the SDGs. “Many indicators, including those linked to nutrition, are outcome based and could show improvement through policy interventions,” says Mr. Mishra.As for overcoming the last-mile challenges faced by the performing States, Mr. Mishra says: “When States perform well, there is a fear of adversity getting pocketed. Meaning, a particular group is disadvantaged.Therefore more effort is needed and inclusive and equitable development could propel a State towards the goals.”"

As far as we’ve ascertained, none has been received as of this very minute,” he added.Last week,Mr. Guterres had “strongly” condemned the terror attack, calling for those behind the attack to be brought to justice.“We strongly condemn today’s attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district and express our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and to the government and people of India,” Mr. Dujarric had said at the daily press briefing last Thursday.Responding to a question by PTI on the terror attack, Mr. Dujarric said, “We of course wish a speedy recovery to those injured and call for those behind the attack to be brought to justice.”"

We have lost over 700 comrades in political killings over the years and the party wants this to end. We had made our stand clear in this regard at the party State conference held in Thrissur.Violation“If party workers are involved in the incident it’s blatant violation of the party decision.

Mr. Balakrishnan alleged that the Congress had unleashed violence during the hartal on Monday.“KPCC working president, K Sudhakaran’s statement that there will be retaliation has triggered violence at many places. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran should make clear if it’s the stand of the party,” he said.

It had almost become a force of habit for Mr. Ramachandran to link every murder in the State to the Chief Minister, he said.Mr Vijayan asked whether any mainstream political party worth its salt would commit such follies when involved in pre-election campaigns like the Kerala Samrakshana Yatra.He said the CPI(M) was more a victim of political violence than other organisations. “We have suffered much pain in silence.

Drawing a comparison between the Pinarayi Vijayan-Kodiyeri Balakrishnan duo of the CPI(M) and the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah leadership of the BJP, the Congress leader said the CPI(M) leaders were Stalinist in their approach.Mr. Vijayan should condemn political murders and come out with a statement that his party would not any further get engaged in political violence.The police should nab the real assailants, he demanded. The families of the slain Youth Congress workers would be provided Rs. 10 lakh each on Wednesday.They would be provided further assistance of Rs. 15 lakh each, which would be collected by begging from the streets of Kasaragod on March 2.The former Union Minister said there were similarities in the manner in which the murders of T.P.

Parties call for conflict resolution mechanism in Kerala
",,"The recurrence of political murders and the possibility of reprisals have yet again reinforced the need for a multi-tier conflict resolution mechanism in the State to nip violence in the bud.Following the murder of two Youth Congress activists in Kasaragod, the UDF and the BJP have turned the heat on the CPI(M). Despite CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan condemning the violence and rejecting the party’s link to the incident, the Opposition has refused to relent.The murders have yet again brought to the fore the need for having a preventive mechanism comprising political leaders, elected representatives and officials at the district and grassroots levels. But compliance with the decisions of such a mechanism is a vexatious issue.Left Democratic Front convener A. Vijayaraghavan toldThe Hinduthat the CPI(M) was not opposed to such a system and it had already been experimented in Kannur. “Since we are victims of political violence and murder in the State, the CPI(M) is not averse to any mechanism that would stymie the spread of violence. Most of the murders, including the latest, are perhaps an over-reaction to local issues and could be quelled easily,” he said.Foolproof systemCongress leader V.M. Sudheeran placed the onus of the recurring violence squarely on the CPI(M) and said there should be a foolproof system to bring conspirators and perpetrators to book. “Quite often those who act behind the scenes and actively involve in such incidents go scot-free for want of a thorough probe. The genuineness of the accused presented in such cases also raises serious doubts,” he said.BJP State spokesperson M.S. Kumar stressed the need for having a system to contain such incidents, but accused the CPI(M) of failing to discharge its role in preventing violence. “As the party in power, the CPI(M) is obliged to maintain peace and harmony in the State, but quite often it fails to perform that role. Local issues could be resolved through discussions, but the CPI(M) is averse to such engagements,” he said."

Factual evidence should be best left to be argued before the magistrate court concerned.Mr. Bhatia interjected, saying that depended on a case-by-case basis.At one point, Justice Sikri asked Mr. Bhatia whether the CBI could investigate cases in West Bengal considering the fact that the State government had withdrawn general consent to the CBI’s jurisdiction within its territory.Here, Mr. Sibal intervened to say that “as an officer of this court, I have to say that nothing can prevent the Supreme Court from ordering a CBI investigation. But having said that, I feel this court should not decide on facts”.The court adjourned the hearing.

Apart from Tapi’s lyrics, Gudavalli Ramabrahmam used, for the first time in films, some of the popular songs of the noted poet Basavaraju Venkata Appa Rao, five years after the poet’s death. And one of those songs was the big hit —Nallavaade gollapillavaade...— set to tune by the multi-faceted Bhimavarapu Narasimha Rao.Kanchanamala played Sampalatha, a Dalit girl, and Sundaramma, her younger sister Anasuya. With playback singing yet to arrive in Telugu cinema, both the actors —- Kanchanamala and Sundaramma — themselves recorded the song.The songSampalatha:Nallavaade golla pillavaade chelli / Kallagaade vaani vallo jikkithine / Nallavaade...As she sings, Nagaraju (played by Gali Venkateswara Rao) enters the scene, hiding behind the trees and watching them sing and dance.Anasuya:Vachhinaade thota jochhinaade akka / vachhi needou manasu muchhilinchaade / Nallavaade...Sampalatha:Aaginaade podala daaginaade manasu / Ragabandhamu chesi laagikonnade / Nallavaade...Anasuya:Choochinaade momu daachinaade needu / Daachukunnaa valapu dochukunnaade / Nallavaade...Sampalatha:Oodinaade murali chedinaade valapu / Naadu madi thana rupu meedu nilipinaade / Nallavaade...Sampalatha – Anasuya:Paadukuntaa maata laadukunataa nannu / Choodavaa dayananchu vedukuntaa/ Nallavaade...The sceneDalits of Kalyanapuram, led by the upper caste social reformer, Chowdharayya (played by P Suribabu) make an attempt to enter the temple. They are stopped by the temple chief priest and trustee Sundara Rama Sastry (Govindarajula Subbarao) and his followers. A follower of non-violence, Chowdharayya (Suribabu) averts a clash between the two groups. Unmindful of these developments, two girls from the downtrodden clan, Sampalatha (Kanchanamala) and her sister Anasuya (Sundaramma) sing their way to their place of worship in a cave. Nagaraju (Gali Venkateswara Rao), a photographer in the city and son of Sundara Rama Sastry, follows the sisters to the cave temple. He falls in love with Sampalatha. He asks the sisters if he could worship their God and gets the reply: Lord Krishna loves all.Malapillawas a trailblazer for such socially relevant topics to tackle on celluloid. It was also the debut movie for the talented Govindarajula Subbarao. There was skepticism when Kanchanamala was signed to play the offbeat character of Sampalatha as the audience had seen her as a glamour doll inGruhalakshmi. However, she proved them wrong and gave both an earthy and gleaming portrayal as an innocent village girl in the first half of the movie and then as the literate modern city woman. Basically a singer, Sundaramma later acted inTarasasankamalong with Suribabu and Pushpalatha and rendered playback in films such as — Gudavalli’sPalnaati Yudham,MayalokamandNirdoshi.Bhimavarapu Narasimha Rao (BNR) made his entry into film music withSati Tulasi(1936). It was he who had brought a sea change in Telugu film music which till then was mostly dependent on stage songs and poems. He changed it all by composing new tunes using folk music. He was also credited with introducing dubbing, re-recording and playback methods in the South, more so in Telugu cinema. One of his most popular compositions was —Nallavaade gollapillavaade— which was a rage in those days, everyone from the literate to the illiterate humming it. With Sundaramma lending her support, Kanchanamala rendered it in a melodic way that paved the way for establishing the ‘glamour doll’ of Telugu cinema as a performing artiste. Incidentally,Malapillawas the 50th talkie in Telugu.In 1977, veteran still photographer ‘Jai Hind’ Sathyam, better known as ‘Mana’ Sathyam, held a screening ofMalapillaat the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce Preview Theatre in Chennai commemorating the 31st death anniversary of Gudavalli Ramabrahmam. On that occasion he felicitated the movie’s lead actors—Kanchanamala and Gali Venkateswara Rao. In her mid-50s then, Kanchanamala still retained her doe-eyed charm but looked lost, oblivious of the felicitations.

We have seen our party men killed and suppressed our sorrow.

Mr. Bhatia contended that the “brutal killings”, with the body of one of the party workers found hanging from a high-tension electric post, exemplified the violence meted out by the Trinamool Congress to its political rivals.“This is not being political, but what is happening in West Bengal?” Justice Sikri remarked.Mr. Sibal, however, responded with a counter-question. “So what is happening in the CBI also... And all of this [Mr. Bhatia’s petition] is indeed politics,” he countered. Arguing that the Supreme Court should not enter the realm of facts in criminal cases like this, Mr. Sibal said factual evidence should be best left to be argued before the Magistrate’s court concerned.At one point, Justice Sikri asked Mr. Bhatia whether the CBI could investigate cases in West Bengal considering the fact that the State government had withdrawn general consent to the CBI’s jurisdiction within its territory. Here, Mr. Sibal intervened and said that “as an officer of this court I have to say that nothing can prevent the Supreme Court from ordering a CBI investigation.

Inmates convicted of kidnapping cannot be transferred there
",,"The Delhi High Court on Monday sought the response of the city government on a plea challenging the Delhi Prison Rules, 2018, which prevent an inmate convicted of kidnapping from being transferred to a semi-open jail, where prisoners are assigned rooms in lieu of cells.A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri issued a notice to the Delhi government and sought its response on the plea of a man, sentenced to life for kidnapping and killing a 19-year-old, who wants to be transferred to a semi-open jail.Those in semi-open jail, which is assigned on the basis of an inmate’s conduct and work, also get desk jobs within the prison complex.The convict, Ashok Vishwakarma, was sentenced to life by a trial court in 2009 and his appeal was dismissed by the HC in 2013.In his plea, the convict has contended that he was not being considered for transfer to the semi-open jail as under the new rules, those convicted for kidnapping are ineligible.Under the Delhi Prison Rules, 2018, those ineligible for semi-open or open jails include inmates who are habitual offenders, are considered dangerous, are involved in serious prison violence, were convicted for offences such as dacoity, terrorist crimes, kidnapping, smuggling, drug trafficking or possession or members of organided criminal gangs, the petition has said.It has claimed that those convicted for murder are considered for transfer to semi-open and open jails based on their conduct and work inside the prison.‘Rule illogical’The petition has contended that “differentiating between convicts for the purpose of semi-open jail, based on the offences for which they are convicted is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution”.It further stated that the rule under challenge is “unconstitutional, arbitrary and illogical” as persons facing trial for kidnapping are released on bail and after conviction are also granted furlough and parole based on their conduct."

Under-Secretary-General of UN says ‘collaborative effort’ needed from all stakeholders ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The fight for gender equality is everybody’s struggle and not just a woman’s, Dr. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Under-Secretary-General of the UN said on Monday.Addressing a gender diversity summit hosted by UN Women and Proctor and Gamble, India at the St. Regis hotel on Monday, Dr. Mlambo-Ngucka said, “With our HeForShe campaign, we are engaging men in leadership positions to open the doors for women so that it doesn’t remain a woman-exclusive job to break the glass ceiling. We need a collaborative effort from all stakeholders. We are engaging presidents and prime ministers in every country, as they can make the maximum impact as well as leaders from the private sectors to call for leadership which is gender inclusive.”She stressed the need for a collaborative effort required in supporting girls at a young age, so that they are not forced to drop out of education or sports due to puberty coupled with the lack of sanitation.Citing the crisis of basic necessities, Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer, P&G said, “Globally, women and girls spend 40 billion hours a year to fetch the basic necessity, clean water. An all-inclusive approach from each individual is required in whatever capacity possible to address the situation.”Breaking gender mythsThe summit also included a session on breaking gender myths, which witnessed participation by Madhusudan Gopalan, Vice President of Indian Subcontinent, P&G and Deanna Bass, Global Director of Diversity & Inclusion, P&G.The panelists agreed that gender myths can be broken by recovering the talent system, which has a broader definition of leadership, stronger equality-based workplaces with equal pay policies and parental leave, and not just maternal leave.Bollywood actress Richa Chadha, who addressed a session titled, ‘The Unstoppable girl – Rewriting the rules’, said there was need to desert the view that ambitious women are man-eaters.“As neck-deep in patriarchy as we are, where women’s achievements are always pegged against domesticity and violence begins in the womb itself, initiatives like ‘Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao’ should be intensified. These should be continued and not just wither away like a fast-fading trend.”The summit was also attended by Olympic boxer Mary Kom, who, answering a question about women being unable to go back to their passion after getting married and having children, said we need a more supportive environment that enables women to do so."
India’s options after Pulwama,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/indias-options-after-pulwama/article26305355.ece,"
Every response is fraught with uncertainty. Can the government take such risks before an election?
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Thedeadly terror attack against a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in South Kashmir’s Pulwama district, which was orchestrated by a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) suicide bomber, Adil Ahmad Dar, 22, has once again brought nuclear-armed India and Pakistan close to a potential armed confrontation. There are widespread calls to respond to the attack which killed 40 CRPF personnel. The question, however, is how. The general election may complicate the answer to this question. The BJP leadership knows that if it plays its cards well, it might stand a chance to form the next government. If it bungles, that chance would become weak. This makes the situation far more dangerous in terms of payoff structures and associated risks.Pakistan needs to actSo far, Pakistan’s response to the attack has been a blanket and unhelpful denial. Prime Minister Imran Khan has chosen to be quiet about it despite the seething anger in India, even as his Ministers are issuing unconvincing denials. Pakistan needs to stop issuing denials and start acting. Let us be clear: the JeM’s leaders are roaming about freely in Pakistan. This is unacceptable. They must be taken to task immediately and there should be a clampdown on other terror organisations as an emergency measure. The Pakistani establishment’s usual answers — ‘we will come to them eventually’ or ‘we are also already fighting them’ — won’t cut ice any more. If Pakistan truly desires peace with India, it needs to play its part honestly. Pakistan should realise that it would be doing a favour to its citizens by cracking down on terror organisations that are thriving on their soil. And why has Pakistan still not invited India’s National Investigation Agency to investigate the Pathankot terror attack even though India had allowed the visit of the Pakistani team to Pathankot in 2016? Pakistan needs to take action against the terror elements on its soil, now.Also ReadThe challenge in the Pulwama attackHaving said that, let’s face some facts: Dar was a local Kashmiri boy, the vehicle used in the attack was local, we do not yet know the source of the explosive, and there is a raging insurgency in Kashmir today. Don’t these facts tell us that New Delhi’s Kashmir policy has been a failure? That it has been unable to calm tempers in Kashmir in the past four and a half years? If so, we must ask the difficult but important question: How did we get to where we are today in Kashmir? Here is some perspective: While in 2013, only six local Kashmiris had joined the ranks of militancy, last year, the figure was close to 200; between 2014 and 2018, ceasefire violations increased five times; between 2015 and 2018, the increase in infiltration attempts more than doubled; and, terrorist-related violence in the Valley has spiked drastically over the past five years.Despite all this, the government was hardly keen to initiate a serious dialogue process with the Kashmiri dissidents. The BJP-PDP government, which fell last year, ensured that the so-called soft separatist space was given away to militants, and the use of aggressive tactics turned south Kashmir’s popular opinion against India. Make no mistake: India finds itself in a bind in Kashmir, and it will take a great deal of political sophistication, backchannel reaching out, and comprehensive political vision to get Kashmir back on track. Do the politicians in New Delhi realise this? I am not sure. Even as the nation stands behind its government, the Central government, when reflecting on the next steps, must accept that its politically unimaginative policy was a failure.Then there is intelligence failure. How is it that a plan to carry out such a major attack, by a local who was on the radar of the local police and other agencies, on a national highway in a troubled State went undetected? Why is that 78 buses with CRPF jawans were allowed to travel in one convoy?India’s optionsIf New Delhi seeks to respond to Pakistan for the Pulwama attack, what options does it have? For the BJP government, given that the elections are so close, its retaliation has to be credible, prompt and visible, thereby limiting its options. Stopping the flow of waters to Pakistan is neither practical nor possible. Withdrawing the Most Favoured Nation status would hardly hurt Pakistan, given the low trade volume involved. Isolating Pakistan internationally is easier said than done — China is closer to Pakistan today than ever before, Russia is warming up to it, and given the impending American drawdown in Afghanistan, there is a sense of triumphalism in Pakistan. This is especially so because of the geopolitical importance of the region — it won’t be long before the U.S. makes a comeback.One possible way out is perhaps to talk to China discreetly to get Pakistan to crack down on the JeM, but that will take patience, persuasion and discretion. A government caught in an election season may have too little of any of it.Also ReadPulwama attack: Probe on to trace source of explosivesWhat about military options? One can think of four types of kinetic options. The first could be to carry out surgical strikes, like India did it 2016. However, while the Pakistani side did not respond to it then, the reaction this time could be different. If Pakistan responds, the two sides may soon find themselves in an escalating military crisis with little clarity about the outcome, something an election-bound government might fight shy of. The second option is to use strike aircraft to carry out precision strikes in locations across the Line of Control (LoC). But such air incursions are likely to be detected and intercepted by Pakistani radars and air defence systems. If an aircraft is shot down or pilots are captured, it could become a bigger headache for the government. Pakistani retaliatory strikes cannot be ruled out either. The third option is to go in for stand-off strikes without physically crossing the border, using heavy artillery or other precision-guided weapons such as rockets. Stand-off strikes, or fire assaults, across the LoC would be responded to in kind and eventually might not achieve anything. The final option is to carry out covert operations inside Pakistan to take out high-value human targets such as leaders of terror outfits. This might be the least costly and most optimal strategy. However, this would require a great deal of preparation and might not be domestically useful given the amount of secrecy and lack of optics surrounding it.In short, the fundamental problem with kinetic options is uncertainty with regard to what those options would lead to if Pakistan decides to respond. India would do better than Pakistan in a conventional war of attrition, but it may or may not remain conventional and there would be attrition on both sides. Would New Delhi be willing to run those risks so close to a crucial election?Happymon Jacob teaches disarmament studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi"

"Omar, Mehbooba appeal for calm",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/omar-mehbooba-appeal-for-calm/article26306357.ece,,,"In a rare joint appeal, National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Monday expressed dismay over attacks on Kashmiris across the country and “urged the Government of India to ensure safety and security.”“Intimidating Kashmiris is aimed at creating a wedge between different communities in India. We should not allow the terror to divide us. By using such incidents to divide us, we fall into the trap of those behind the attack on CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) soldiers; we are wittingly or unwittingly playing to the tunes of our enemies,” said Ms. Mufti and Mr. Abdullah in the statement.The two former chief ministers underscored the need to maintain communal harmony across the country.They said Kashmiri Muslims or the Muslims of Jammu did not attack the CRPF jawans but terrorists did. “This violence is a convenient tool by some to shift the blame. Let us unite against terror, let’s not allow terror to divide us,” they said.They appealed to the GOI to ensure the safety and security of Kashmiris. “It doesn’t augur well for a democratic country like India to hound its own people in its response to the heinous attack on our forces. Hounding innocent Kashmiris will indisputably disenchant them; the humiliation, suspicion, isolation will push innocent Kashmiris to the wall,"" they warned.The leaders also expressed concern over reports of violence and arson in Jammu.Meanwhile, curfew was relaxed in parts of Jammu city on Monday for the first time in three days."

Ramesh Chennithala says murders barbaric
",,"The United Democratic Front (UDF) on Monday went after the CPI(M) for the murder of two Youth Congress activists in Kasaragod, accusing it of perpetrating the cult of political violence.The highlight of the rather vehement protests of the UDF was Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s telephone call to express his shock and grief. He called up when Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran, Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal and K.C. Joseph, MLA, were at the residence of one of the bereaved families.Mr. Chennithala termed the murders “barbaric” and saw it as an indication of the CPI(M)’s refusal to give up the cult of political violence.Indian Union Muslim League general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, while condemning the killings, said it was disturbing that the CPI(M) was the common factor in all political murders in the State in the past few years. “I shudder to think where justice can be had if the ruling party is promoting such violence. The murders were pre-meditated and comes even before the State recovered from Shuhaib’s murder,” he said.The KPCC president said the State had witnessed 29 political murders in the 1,000 days since the LDF came to power, he said in a statement. He said the murders were pre-planned and the method of killing was the same in the T.P. Chandrasekharan and Shuhaib murder cases.He said the CBI had a huge workload in Kerala. It is involved in investigations in four cases related to political murders in Kannur alone. The involvement of CPI(M) leaders had been exposed in several of these. Kerala was placed third in political murders taking place in the country. Mr. Ramachandran tried to give a historical perspective to the political killings in Kannur, linking some of them to Mr. Vijayan and CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.The UDF leadership announced its decision to defer its proposed demonstration on Tuesday against the Pinarayi government which would complete 1,000 days in office.State witnessed 29 political murders in the 1,000 days since the LDF came to power.Mullappally RamachandranKPCC president"

Workers who violated such directives would be expelled and the party would not offer any protection to them, he said.

Covering a tragedy with empathy,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/covering-a-tragedy-with-empathy/article26305433.ece,"
For many 24x7 TV channels, death means a sensational story ",,"Accidents, murders, and cases of sexual assault and violence dominate the news cycle. Journalists are confronted with difficult questions when such incidents take place: Whom do we approach for information? When does the quest for details become an intrusion into moments of grief? How do we move beyond basic facts and provide a human face to a tragedy in a sensitive manner?While many print journalists grapple with this moral quandary, many reporters of 24x7 news channels, especially local channels, have little time to ponder such questions as morbid deaths pique public curiosity. While journalists often hover around a victim’s house, waiting for the so-called right moment to ask the kin questions, TV journalists hound bereaved family members. Camerapersons even jostle for a view of the body in the ambulance.For me, this macabre fascination was most apparent on April 9, 2013, when a gas tanker toppled close to Mangaluru. The expanding gas ball set fire to everything and everyone within 50 meters. Ten people died in the accident, and many more were injured.In hospitals in Mangaluru, where victims were shifted for treatment, the staff forgot to man the entry into the burns ward. Journalists entered in droves and camerapersons attempted to go as close to the victims as they could. Wails and screams of pain cut through the chaos.A few journalists stood by the door. The sister of a victim, who was critically injured, skirted the camerapersons and stood beside us. We tucked our notebooks into our pockets, and she gave vent to her grief in disparate words uttered amid uncontrollable sobs. The camerapersons saw this. One quickly gave me the mic and instructed me to hold it close to her face (TV reporters were at the accident site and he had to ensure that his channel logo was in the frame). She turned away and covered her face. She clearly did not want her private moment of mourning to be telecast. When he was done with his shot, he went to the other families.In another hospital nearby, the brother-in-law of a delivery man, who had been riding behind the gas tanker, stepped out of the ICU. He was in shock, but answered questions calmly. But long after the TV cameras moved away, he sat on a chair and wept. Only two reporters remained. We sat beside him in silence. The family, he said, was in debt. It had been only six months since his sister’s wedding. She hadn’t been informed of the accident yet. Our end-of-the-day deadline allowed us the time to console him.Later that evening, when I was struggling to file the copy within the allotted word length, he called up to say his brother-in-law had died. He asked if I could request the district administration to expedite formalities. By then, gory images had been repeatedly telecast, and many people had come forward to help the affected families.Minutes later, a TV reporter called me to say he had visuals of a man in flames running on the road. Could I ask the man whether it was his brother-in-law in the video, he asked. No, I said. Soon after, I switched on the TV. The channel announced his death and played visuals of the man in flames and his brother-in-law crying on loop."

And they are saying ‘come and play here’. Unless the court intervenes, we are not expecting natural justice.”In a statement, the AIFF said that the match commissioner’s report following the no-show had been sent to the League Committee for further action even as it chose not to comment on the consequences.The AIFF added: “Despite the tragic events, football for the people of Jammu and Kashmir has been maintained on schedule, with assistance from the security provided by the authorities. Qualifying matches for Santosh Trophy were completed on February 16, approximately 36km from Jammu in Katra, which was, and is still under curfew.”Real Kashmir co-founders Sandeep Chattoo and Shamim Meraj expressed disappointment. “We had made all the necessary arrangements for the visiting team. Despite apprehensions, a lot of locals turned up for the match,” they toldPTIin a joint statement.“Minerva Punjab should not have mixed sports with politics. This will only amplify the ongoing hatred against Kashmiris and is likely to impact upcoming matches too,” said Manzoor Ahmad, technical coach of Real Kashmir. “We regret the decision. We waited on the ground for them to arrive. Violence on one side and football on other side has been going on in J&K for three decades now.”Real Kashmir is first team from Jammu & Kashmir to qualify for the I-League, in 2018, raising hopes for football talent of the State. The rookie team has done exceptionally well compared to other nine seasoned teams that qualified for the league all over the country."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The first day of oral arguments in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague concluded with India accusing Pakistan of “knowingly, wilfully and brazenly” flouting the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.India also attacked the “farcical” military trial of Mr. Jadhav, who was found guilty and sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017.It requested the court to annul the verdict of the military court and direct Pakistan to set Mr. Jadhav free on the basis of the “review and reconsideration” process that would be available to him in that country.The hearing took place without former Pakistani Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who was taken ill before the proceedings commenced and before he could be sworn in as an ad hoc ICJ judge.He is expected to take part in the proceedings on Tuesday.Speaking outside the court after the proceedings, Harish Salve, India’s counsel expressed his optimism that “justice will be done.” However, Pakistan’s lead counsel Khawar Qureshi QC said he had been “disappointed” by India’s arguments, insisting there was “nothing new,” in them, and that “fundamental questions” remained unanswered.The case stripped of “irrelevances’ put forward by Pakistan boiled down to these two main issues around the military court proceedings and consular access, Mr. Salve, told the Monday morning hearing. He said that the 2017 provisional measures introduced by the ICJ that required Pakistan to not execute Mr. Jadhav until the full proceedings could take place had saved “the imminent threat of life to an innocent Indian national” and had given “hope” to the whole country.He rejected Pakistan’s contentions that the circumstances of the case – and the fact that Mr. Jadhav is accused of espionage and the case relates to national security – made those consular access requirements redundant, and repeatedly accused Pakistan of using the case for domestic propaganda purposes. India also maintains that it is the 1963 Convention on consular relations rather than the 2008 bilateral agreement on consular relations that applies to the case, putting it firmly in the jurisdiction of the ICJ.The lack of consular access had been the prime focus of the 2017 hearing at which India had successfully sought provisional measures from the court requiring Pakistan to stay the execution of Mr. Jadhav pending the main hearings.On Monday, Mr. Salve also focused on the military court system in Pakistan, attacking the increased use of such courts to try civilians, in “opaque and secret” proceedings; 274 civilians – including “possibly children” had been convicted in Pakistan’s military courts over the past couple of years, he said, contrasting it with India which had “never considered amending,” the Army Act to cover civilians.In a detailed account of the events that had unfolded since March 3 2016, when Pakistan said it had arrested Mr. Jadhav in Balochistan, Mr. Salve noted not only the repeated lack of consular access, despite repeated requests from India but also the lack of information provided to it on the specifics of the trial process and charges against Mr. Jadhav.Instead, he accused Pakistan of engaging in repeated propaganda, and of using the case to build a narrative against India. “We have not seen the evidence against Jadhav, we have seen the doctored confession “over and over again,” he said.The high rate of “confessions” from those civilians who had been found guilty by military courts raised questions about the adequacy of safeguards within them, including raising the possibility of torture being used to extract confessions, and the “high risk of mistreatment,” he said.Rather than pushing for the court to order a review of the case in Pakistan, Mr. Salve argued that the evidence suggested that the review and relief mechanisms available to Mr. Jadhav and India were “highly inadequate.” Pakistan’s “military courts cannot command the confidence of this court and should not be sanctified,” he told the court, during the opening session that took nearly the entire three hours allocated to the proceedings.Mr. Jillani was taken ill ahead of the proceedings and left the court’s grounds by ambulance. He was therefore not sworn in as an ad hoc judge in the case as had been planned. It meant that the proceedings took place before the 15 ICJ judges, including former Indian Supreme Court Judge Dalveer Bhandari. However, at the start of the proceedings the President of the Court, Somalian judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf left open the possibility of him taking part in subsequent proceedings, telling the court at the start of the hearing simply that he “will not be sitting today.”On Tuesday, Pakistan will respond with its opening oral arguments, also set over a three-hour time period. This will be followed by two one and a half hour sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, where India and Pakistan will present their concluding arguments. There is no set time period for a judgment to be made, though typically such cases take around six months to be considered. Judgments are based on a simple majority decision, and in the case of a tie, the President has the casting vote. The decisions of the court are binding, final and non-appealable, though in exceptional circumstances certain recourses are available to parties, including requests for interpretation of the judgment.The ICJ is the main judicial arm of the UN, established in 1945 to deal with “contentious” cases submitted to it by member states and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it, but is not a criminal court.The case is only the fourth one involving a death sentence to be heard by the ICJ since the first in 1999, and the first that does not involve the US. (Those involved Germany, Mexico and Paraguay).While the Pulwama terrorist attack on February 14 was not specifically mentioned by India during the proceedings, Mr. Salve attacked Pakistan’s “feeble” attempts at tackling cross-border terrorism. Ahead of the proceedings, Pakistan attacked India’s response to the terrorist attack and accusations of Pakistani involvement, alleging a “clear dichotomy” in India’s position by denying “when confronted with voluntary confessions and acceptance of responsibility by its serving Naval commander Jadhav for perpetrating terrorist violence in Pakistan.”"

Five students from Dehradun have been sent to Kashmir ",,"The liaison officers appointed by the State Administrative Council of Jammu and Kashmir in different cities are coordinating with students of the Valley, studying across the country, for their security, said an officer on Sunday.Media reports of alleged mischievous WhatsApp chats and rumours of a few landlords asking their Kashmiri tenants to vacate has created fear among the students, said officers.Owing to this, seven liaison officers have been appointed across 10 major cities to ensure the safety of the students. Also, control rooms have been set up in the office of the Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir.A liaison officer said they are coordinating with State police chiefs and local police over the safety and security of Kashmiri students studying in Ambala, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Aligarh, Greater Noida, New Delhi and other cities in north Delhi.“We have not received any call regarding violence from Kashmiri students from any of the cities in north India on our helpline number. But, we are getting calls from parents who are worried about their children and want them to be back. We have assured them of full cooperation from the authority,” said the officer.On February 16, rumours spread across Dehradun over violence against Kashmiri students. Following this, a liaison officer went to meet the students to see if they needed any kind of assistance, along with Dehradun police. Around 1,500-2,000 Kashmiri students study at various colleges and institutes in Dehradun.“We took five Kashmiri students from Dehradun and shifted them to a guest house in Delhi. On Sunday, they were sent to Kashmir. We are arranging a safe mode of transport for the students who want to go back to Kashmir via road or by any other means of transport,” added the officer.‘We feel unsafe’“Things have changed all of a sudden. We feel unsafe. The hate messages against Kashmiris that are making rounds on social media have forced us to search for a safe place. The flight tickets are very expensive, but we have no other option. Many of our friends have taken a bus to Kashmir after Dehradun police safely escorted them till the bus stand,” said a Kashmiri student.A liaison officer said that all the staff are on their toes for the past three days.They are functioning round-the-clock and are in touch with students, parents, college managements and the local police to maintain proper communication with each of them.Delhi police spokesperson Madhur Verma tweeted: “Security has been strengthened all across the national capital, including minority dominated areas.

Protection rackets at Techopark locality channel money to Puducherry
",,"A simmering rivalry between two opposing gangs running competing protection rackets is threatening public peace in Technopark locality, the State’s IT hub which is witnessing a construction boom.State police investigators say the recurrent feuding between the two alleged gang leaders, who go by the nickname Panchayat Unni and Korean Kochumon, has precipitated an escalation in gang violence in Kazhakuttom, Mangalapuram and Menamkulam localities after a year-long hiatus.Street fights and attacks on the houses of rivals have once again become a cyclical offence, stirring a deep sense of insecurity among residents and also the local business community.Officers said there had been a corresponding increase in the registration of hurt, arson and trespass cases in the police subdivision.Police officers said the gang leaders themselves were suspects in more than 40 violent crimes and had undergone detention several times under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities Prevention Act (KAAPA).Undercover operationIn early January, the police had launched an undercover operation to understand the source of income of the wanted men.They focussed more on Unni who had reportedly made sizeable real estate investments in the Union Territory of Puducherry.They found that a set of builders, labour contractors, tipper lorry owners and shop owners regularly transferred varying amounts of money to the accounts of the suspects or that of their nominees.With Kochu Mon in jail, the police launched a search for Unni who was arrested last month from a restaurant in Puducherry.Officers said the accused lorded over his protection racket from the Union Territory where he had considerable investments.Scores of flats, independent villas, shops and commercial complexes are coming up in the suburban neighbourhoods abutting the IT hub.The police said promoters paid off the gangs to ensure they could proceed with their ventures in relative security.Notice to buildersA senior officer said the police were likely to send notices to the builders and business persons under section 162 of the CrPC to explain their financial transactions with the gangs.A few of them have stated their intent to be witnesses."

The challenge in the Pulwama attack,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-challenge-in-the-pulwama-attack/article26298200.ece,"
India cannot achieve its strategic objectives if Kashmiris remain targets of harassment, and minorities are vilified ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In recent months, those with experience in monitoring Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan had been getting distinctly uncomfortable. There were signals emanating from Pakistan pointing to a new turn. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was trying to make overtures to India and conveying that his government would be one with a difference, a ‘Naya-Pakistan’ as he called it. Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa had earlier attempted to confound observers through a long interaction with the media, which came to be touted as the Bajwa Doctrine, and was ‘supposed’ to be a hand of friendship. The offer to open the Kartarpur Corridor and the fast-track progress to the conduct of ceremonies to launch the construction of the project were uncharacteristic. His presence at the ceremony on the Pakistani side appeared to reflect total consensus and support of the Army.It was somehow the wrong time for Pakistan to be making peace overtures when the Indian elections were approaching. Pakistan could not have expected any big and strategic decisions, and sure enough India’s response to everything was lukewarm. The circumstances did not permit any traction unless a firm commitment was given about the withdrawal of all support from across the border to terrorists.Also ReadViolence against Kashmiris: Whose purpose do the mobs serve, asks Omar AbdullahNew terror tacticsWhenever Pakistan starts to speak the language of peace, it raises hackles in India because it seems evident that something unusual is in the offing and overtures are primarily there to bait India. It has been proved again atPulwama, with the most dastardly act perpetrated since the beginning of the 30-year-long proxy war in Jammu & Kashmir.Two issues are of relevance here. The first is that the return of the car bomb and the improvised explosive device (IED) to the Kashmir theatre was predicted for the last one year. The trend had died out after the last effective IED attack, on an Army bus in July 2008, and the last car bomb attack, again on an Army bus on the very same road, in 2004. IEDs had been rampant earlier but car bombs were few and far between. It was the progressive improvement in the fabrication of IEDs and car bombs in the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and the internal security environment of Pakistan that probably gave an impetus to perceptions about their potential usage once again in Kashmir.Also ReadTerrible Thursday: on Pulwama terror attackThe Pakistani experience had also much to do with religiously radicalised young men strapped with explosives detonating themselves at gatherings of people — the suicide bomber as against the suicide fighter. Suicide bombing was neither experienced in earlier years nor has it manifested itself yet in Kashmir. Its threat potential, of course, remains live and its entry could further change the nature of the proxy war.Pakistan’s deep state has been aware that the Indian security forces have achieved much in the last two years in terms of neutralisation of terrorists, although almost the same number have been added through fresh recruitment or infiltration. In order to reduce the domination and effectiveness achieved by the security forces and to limit their freedom of movement, the reintroduction of these devices could achieve much. That is because the unpredictability factor of IEDs and car bombs is so high that it forces a larger than normal deployment of security forces.Sign of Pakistan’s confidenceThe second relevant issue, or observation, is that Pakistan’s self-confidence has been increasing. This has been despite the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) surveillance, its reduced foreign exchange reserves and a failing economy. The backing from China and, most importantly, Pakistan’s enhanced geostrategic and geopolitical significance in the light of the U.S. decision to pull out in full from Afghanistan have also contributed to it. The moment that decision on Afghanistan was taken, Pakistan once again acquired leverage with the big powers and all stakeholders for peace in Afghanistan. The realisation that it held the key to the return of the Taliban, the upholding of all its agreements with the foreign forces and future stability, gave Pakistan a strategic boost. The U.S. started courting it in a reversal of President Donald Trump’s policy which had questioned the utility of such nations which had taken excess U.S. funding as aid and never delivered strategic advantage to it.Also ReadConcern in Valley over ''threats'' to Kashmiri students, traders outside StateIt is the first sign of Pakistan’s increasing confidence that can be seen in thePulwama attack executed by the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM),an organisation virtually sponsored and owned by Pakistan’s intelligence agencies. Initial investigation suggests careful planning, infiltration of an ‘IED doctor’ (a technical person capable of fabricating IEDs) and a module fully functional at work with a network of overground workers. An apparent risk analysis in Pakistan would have revealed that with the internal health and state of equipment of the Indian armed forces under intense negative discussion in India, the feasibility of a response would be remote. An energetic impetus to terror would follow and this would probably have an effect on the electoral prospects of the current National Democratic Alliance government, besides preparing ground for extended violence into the future. Time and again Pakistan has been wrong in the assessments it makes.While the mortal remains of 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel were transported for last rites to cities and villages all over India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly promised retribution for the loss and emphasised that he had given the freedom of choosing the time, mode and place to the Indian Army. A rare political consensus, short-lived no doubt, has appeared in New Delhi, and the media is discussing military options. To be realistic, that is how the modern world functions, on the power of public opinion.If that be so, what options does the Indian government have? The diplomatic one is already under execution although the energy of Indian diplomacy to paint Pakistan red must flow longer and focus on not only important capitals of the world but also significant international think tanks and media. The Most Favoured Nation status and measures involving control of water under the Indus Waters Treaty remain soft options, sans much optics. It’s the military domain which is demanding Mr. Modi’s focus. A risk analysis would already be under way to examine a range of options or combinations. It could start with covert operations which can be ongoing, to trans-border raids several notches higher than the surgical strikes and targeting Pakistan Army resources as against terrorist infrastructure, and surgical air strikes against terrorist bases inside Pakistan. Ground-based operations restricted to Jammu & Kashmir and harking back to some of the options of yesteryear could form a part of the overall response. However, it should be remembered that Pakistan will not permit such actions without its military response, which too would be robust.Time to be cool headedThe Indian national leadership would do well not to be guided by the immediacy of electoral considerations; national security interests transcend this. Whatever are the selected options, the two things that would make for stronger execution are political consensus and management of internal social cohesion. India cannot achieve its strategic objectives if Kashmiris remain targets of physical abuse and harassment, and minorities are vilified on social media. It is a difficult time for India and the leadership has to work overtime to ensure that the Indian armed forces have a ‘firm base’ to operate from; that is always a military need anyway.Syed Ata Hasnain retired as Lt.

Threatened, asked to leave city ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"For the first few hours of Saturday morning, Dr. Rafique Dar (name changed to protect identity), had made up his mind to leave Kolkata.The Kashmiri cardiologist was threatened and told to leave the city to ensure the safety of his family. But by evening, he changed his mind following a massive outpouring of what he described as “love and care from his fellow city dwellers.” The middle-aged doctor from Srinagar has been residing in Kolkata since 2007.“I have made this my home and I want to live here,” said Dr. Dar, who is married to a Bengali Christian teacher. But following two incidents in quick succession, his confidence in Kolkata started receding.On Saturday morning, a group of men encircled him at his doorstep and told him they would “destroy” his family if he did not leave for Kashmir in 24 hours. The men, unarmed and in their 20s, abused him and Kashmiris, for the Pulwama attack. A similar incident took place on Friday evening.“They repeatedly said that they would harm my family and wife,” Dr. Dar said, sitting in his spacious living room in south Kolkata’s Tiljala area. The doctor from Srinagar’s Government Medical College requested that he should not be identified, or his family or even his neighbourhood.The earlier incident, the first after the Pulwama attack, took place on Friday evening as Dr. Dar stepped out to buy groceries. “A separate set of men encircled me, identified me as a Kashmiri and threatened me,” he said.Following the incidents, Dr. Dar wrote to the Chief Minister, who did not respond, but the chairperson of the State’s Child Rights Commission, Ananya Chakraborty, called to ensure his safety. Earlier, the Home Ministry had issued an advisory to the States to provide safety to Kashmiris. Dr. Dar thanked a Kashmiri journalist for circulating his post where he appealed for “protection”, which went viral.Among the early respondents was a Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) activist Sumaan Sengupto. He spoke to his friend Samim Ahmed, a noted writer, and informed the police.“I think the officer informed the local Tiljala Police Station and they acted promptly,” Sengupto said.Kolkata has about 50 Kashmiri women and men working in mostly in the private sector. The number goes up in the winter as the families of Kashmiri residents visit the city. Besides, an unknown number of dry fruit and garments retailers have visited the city periodically, over decades. The police do not have any record of them. “Because we never had any major problem with the Kashmiris visiting the city,” said a retired Commissioner of Kolkata Police.One of the two Kolkata police personnel posted outside Dr. Dar’s flat said that they are “posted in shifts to provide round-the-clock security.” Dr. Dar said that officials were meeting him periodically, exchanging “a few friendly words to boost confidence” while his phone had not stopped ringing since the post went viral. Following such support, Dr. Dar changed his mind by late evening on Saturday.“There are so many people around, so many are offering us to stay with them, calling or visiting us. I’m feeling happy and secured,” he said. However, he still is worried about his two daughters, who go to a nearby school. “Is it possible to provide security to the kids throughout the year?” he asks.Meanwhile, the public address system perched on the roof of the mobile vans of Kolkata Police are asking people to “maintain calm and peace,” while small rallies are brought out to advocate an attack on Pakistan."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Jammu and Kashmir has seen a steady increase in IED blasts and other bombing incidents over the last five years, with 2018 witnessing a 57% jump in such incidents while two other major theatres of violence — LWE-hit areas and northeast — saw the number of such incidents going down, a latest report has found.While the State that shares border with both Pakistan and China saw a total of 37 incidents of bombing (improvised explosive device and explosive ordnance triggered) in 2014, these incidents grew to 46 in 2015, 69 in 2016, 70 in 2017 and as high as 117 during 2018.A report in this context was presented by the National Bomb Data Centre (NBDC) of the NSG during a two-day international conference in Delhi, that concluded recently, on the menace and threats posed by IEDs.The NBDC of the elite ‘black cats’ commando force is the national repository of all IED and bombing incidents that take place in the country and the unit also conducts post-blast investigation of all such incidents, including the Pulwama blast case.The report made a special mention of J&K and the growing threat of IED and similar explosives in the State at a time when investigators suspect that the deadly attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel in Pulwama on February 14 was executed by a ‘lone wolf’ Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist by blowing off a 20-kg strong RDX mix explosive, laden in a car, next to a troop-carrier bus plying as part of a convoy on the Jammu-Srinagar Highway.“There was considerable decrease in IED blast incidents in all regions of the country except in J&K where terrorists resorted to increased use of IEDs during 2018,” the report accessed byPTIsaid.It added that while IED blast incidents reduced to 77 last year from 98 in 2017 in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-hit areas of the country, such incidents in J&K rose by 57% from 21 in 2017 to 33 during 2018.The IED blast incidents in the northeast insurgency theatre reduced to 32 last year as compared to 66 in the year 2017, indicating a decrease of 52%, the report accessed by the news agency said.The report said while there was a “steep decrease” in the number of IED blast incidents in the country as a whole, fatalities due to these explosions increased “considerably” in all the violence theatres of J&K, LWE and northeast.In 2017, while a total of 244 incidents of IED blasts took place in the country leading to 61 deaths, the last year witnessed only 174 such incidents but a higher number of deaths at 108.While one death was recorded due to IED blast in J&K in 2017, the improvised explosives claimed 13 lives in the State that is reeling under terrorism for past many decades.“Terrorists in J&K, who were normally relying on explosive ordnance, also resorted to IEDs during 2018 as these devices offered them near total anonymity,” the report said.Explosive ordnance denotes shells and bombs of military grade.The report said fatal casualties in IED blast incidents increased considerably during the last year, as compared to 2017, in the LWE, north and J&K theatres and also the rest of India.“The disgruntled and desperate insurgents, terrorists and CPI (Maoists), who had suffered setbacks in 2018, resorted to renewed IED attacks to avoid direct confrontation with the security forces.“55 people, including civilians were killed in LWE areas alone, which accounted for more than 50% of the total fatalities that took place in the country in IED blast incidents,” the report said.Of the 55 killed, fifteen were civilians which accounted for 27% of total casualties which took place due to IED blast incidents in LWE areas, it said.J&K, as per the report, also witnessed a “rise” in non-fatal casualties in IED blast incidents as compared to the other two major combat theatres.Although there was a steep increase in number of fatalities in IED blast incidents in 2018 as compared to the previous year, the non-fatal casualties saw a reverse trend in the year 2018 recording a considerable decrease in number of non-fatal casualties in all regions of the country “except” J&K, it stated.The report said that overall number of non-fatal casualties in 2018 is 33% less than the number of non-fatal casualties recorded in 2017.The report said while in J-K security forces were the “prime target” of terrorists’ IEDs, all such devices — using a mix of metal shrapnels, RDX, TNT and incendiary chemicals — were largely made of “high grade explosives”."

Should the state leave religion alone?,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/should-the-state-leave-religion-alone/article26292463.ece,"
There is no simple yes or no answer to this question. Much depends on what we mean by the term religion
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Sabarimala judgment and its aftermath have brought the issue of state intervention in religion back to the table: should governments leave religion alone, instead of interfering in it? Much depends on what one means by religion.In one sense, religion refers to that aspect of human life where we relate to the transcendent, through personal belief or collective practice. This transcendent entity can be seen either as existing within human persons or outside them, in the highest possible realm. Religion then largely consists of spiritual exercises by which one digs deeper or goes higher. A mind-boggling variety of ways to carry out these exercises exist — god-dependent, gods and goddesses-dependent, or entirely independent of god. Let us just call this religion faith. To the question, should governments leave faith alone, the answer simply has to be a resounding yes. Not that the government’s interference is always unwarranted. For example, if collective rituals involve human sacrifice, then states should intervene. The point is that there must be a general presumption that governments must not interfere in faith.Intervening in organised religionHowever, it is commonplace that as faith communities become large, they feel the need to be rule-bound; in order to become stable and self-sustaining, they institutionalise themselves. But institutionalisation often involves the introduction of hierarchical relations of power and status. Some people in this relation have more power and status, are ‘more equal’ than others. They systematise beliefs surrounding spiritual exercises into explicit doctrines. They insist on doctrinal purity and lay down strict but spurious rules that split followers into the normal and the deviant. They fix violent and exclusionary penalties for the ‘deviants’ and thereby manufacture gated communities with robust notions of who is inside and who is outside. Concepts of heresy and infidelity are generated and a whole society infested with persecution comes into being. In this second sense, religion refers to institutionalised faith communities, such as the those headed by a church, math or sangha. Now, spiritual exercises cannot be undertaken without belonging to such strongly institutionalised religion. Should the state allow discrimination, exclusion, marginalisation, humiliation, oppression, or persecution by elite-controlled religious institutions, or instead ensure that those within the faith community lead a free, dignified life? My view on this is crystal clear. A government must, albeit with great care and sensitivity, intervene in organised religion to prevent any practices of domination within it. It should also inhibit any attempt on its part to dominate members of other religious communities.There is, however, a third sense in which the term religion is used, one that refers neither only to faith, nor to powerful institutions that order and control it, but instead to historically transmitted traditions, indeed to an entire way of life. Thus, people frequently say that Hinduism is not a religion in the conventional sense but is rather a way of life. But if religion is a whole way of life and if this entails the breakdown of the very distinction between religion and society or religion and culture, then all relations of hierarchy and domination that are found in society are also subsumed under ‘religion’. In this conception of Hinduism as a way of life, caste or gender hierarchies are as religious as they are social. Caste domination or gender violence then become integral to Hinduism. How can a state that has accepted freedom and equality as one of its founding principles turn a blind eye to these oppressive practices within the Hindu way of life? In short, if religion is conceived as a way of life, then the state is duty-bound to intervene in religion. Here, the answer to the question, should the government leave religion alone, must be an even more categorical no.Keeping a principled distanceIt is because religion is a complex and morally ambivalent phenomenon that there cannot be a single, emphatic yes or no answer to the question raised above. In my own work over decades, I have consistently maintained that a strict separation between state and religion is not desirable. The state can neither take the view that it will control all aspects of religion, nor that it will have nothing to do with it; that no matter what happens, it will always keep religion at an arm’s length. The state must keep, what I have called, a principled distance from all religions.What does it entail for law and public policy in relation to religion? On the principled distance view, there is absolutely no need for a state to have any law or public policy pertaining to matters of faith untainted by control, hierarchy or exclusion. A state must not interfere in what faith we have and how it is practised. Faith in god, gods and goddesses or in god-independent human qualities such as reason must remain free from interference. But equally, a just, egalitarian, and freedom-sensitive state cannot abandon its obligation to remove the residue of intra- or inter-religious domination from its society. This is why laws that prohibit triple talaq or lift restrictions on women to enter temples such as Sabarimala must be enacted. Customs that demean or humiliate women must go.I have consistently argued that this is precisely how secularism is conceived in India: not as a political perspective that permits authoritarian control of religion by the state; nor one that encourages a libertarian hands-off approach towards it; but as one that promotes a nuanced and flexible policy of value-based political or legal decision on whether or not to intervene in religion. This principled distance variety of secularism is the unique ethical stance of the Indian Constitution, a gift from India to the rest of the world."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When they returned to collect the eco-friendly banners of the just-concluded Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha at Ennore, the organisers heaved a sigh of satisfaction. The Vizha had stayed faithful to its name: it was held in space carved out of roadside shops on Kathivakkam High Road. It had brought a medley of performing-art forms to everyday locales, thereby reaffirming its goal: ‘When we recognise art-forms and performers, why do we segregate the audiences and platforms?’The event had ended with a trailblazing evening.Paraiartists of Manimaran Magazhini Kalaikkuzhu — men, women and two 10-year-olds — played through the gullies of the fishing village before reaching the venue. On stage, they presented a finely choreographed act, thumping and dancing in harmony. “Paraiis for life, not death,” said V Sasikumar, guru, recalling the instrument’s association with funerals. “Let the beats tear through divisions in society.”In thevillupattuthat followed, middle-school boys took up issues concerning Ennore. They sang about the degradation of the coast and the river creek, the death of fish, and sand theft. The river is gone, they said, and in its place we have rubble for roads. Our beautiful locality is now fly ash-ridden. Where is our Pazhavakkadu waterway? We sing, beat drums, get people to protest industrialisation. Enough of ‘development’, give us our river, our old life, they sang.B Muthuchandran’s ancient art of goat-leather puppetry dealt with domestic violence and the menace of plastic carry-bags. In a witty conversation, a family of flat Stanleys told the audience how plastic blocks leach the soil. If you can’t burn or bury it, don’t use it, was their message. “Our family has been in puppetry for 15 generations, and we have remained relevant by combining epics with contemporary issues,” said Muthuchandran, introducing the three behind-the-screen artists.Story-telling reached new heights with theKiRa Kuzhambuplay performed by Anandasami, Maya Krishnan, and Ravindran Vijay. They presented Ki Rajanarayanan’s short stories. With colourful shawls, two boxes and headworn mics, they told their protracted story in songs,kathakalakshepam, mimicry, dialogues and dances — in a mix of English and regional Tamil. It was an interactive burlesque of vigorous action and funny ad-libbing that had fantasy, mythology, and Nature cleverly inter-woven with twists and turns. The audience loved it.Fittingly, curtains came down with a concert by TM Krishna and Sangeetha Sivakumar. ‘Senthamizh nadennum pothinile...’ they began, and went on to ‘Kavava’, ‘Porumbokku’ (the Vizha anthem), ‘Nenjukku needhi’, ending with ‘Om Shakthi’ reaching a high crescendo.People hooted in delight. “I love Carnatic music,” said Suguna R, homemaker. Renuka I, a fisherwoman said she was glad that theparaigot recognition, saying, “The organisers visit us regularly, talk about measures to stop destruction of the coast, water contamination, death of sea-life.”Janakiraman, a student from Kattukuppam, said he was grateful thekutcheriwas brought to Ennore: “Its presence here is a revolution.”Fisherwoman S Venmathi said she was impressed by the dialogue delivery of the puppetry artistes.

Some yellow vest protesters have expressed racist or anti-Semitic views online and on the sidelines of protests.“I felt an absolute hate,” Finkielkraut told the Sunday paper Le Journal du Dimanche. He expressed relief that police intervened.Lines of riot police used tear gas and an impressive backup, a special horse brigade and water cannons — apparently not used — to force the agitated crowd to disperse.The Paris prosecutor’s office said 15 people were detained for questioning, far less than the scores detained in earlier, larger demonstrations that degenerated into scattered rioting and destruction.Violence has marked most of the protests that started against fuel taxes and grew into a mass movement against Macron and his pro-business policies.However, the increasingly divided movement is having trouble maintaining momentum, and support from the public that initially massively backed protesters, polls showed.French media quoted the Interior Ministry as saying that 41,500 protesters nationwide turned out Saturday, some 10,000 less than the previous week, with 5,000 in Paris."
‘Coming Out as Dalit — A Memoir’ review: A Dalit who stopped being a ‘brahmin’,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/coming-out-as-dalit-a-memoir-review-a-dalit-who-stopped-being-a-brahmin/article26290233.ece,"
A personal story becomes a powerful social commentary against everyday casteism that often goes unchallenged
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Memoirs by Dalit writers tend to be documents of suffering. They are testaments of the atrocities heaped upon them by India’s indigenously developed misery-generating machine known as the caste system. But violence and humiliation are not the only forms of caste oppression. There are other, more insidious, yet equally devastating forms of abuse that caste inflicts. One such is being forced to live your life pretending to be of another caste, terrified of your true identity being discovered.Journalist Yashica Dutt’sComing Out as Dalitdocuments the torment of such a life, and how she worked up the courage to discard pretence and embrace her identity as a Dalit. The book is a mix of memoir — of a Dalit who pretends to be a brahmin, until she doesn’t — and social commentary, interspersed with brief historical fragments about the Dalit movement. The personal narrative alternates with observations on caste, “the invisible arm that turns the gears in nearly every system in our country,” in Dutt’s memorable words.Caste aspirationsDutt was born in Ajmer, Rajasthan. Her father was a civil servant with the State government. Her mother, whose dream of joining the IPS was wrecked by a difficult marriage to an alcoholic, worked a series of hard, low-paying gigs to put her children through school. What stands out in Dutt’s account of her childhood is her mother’s determination to give her children an upper caste, middle class upbringing. An integral part of her strategy to achieve that aim was to pass them off as upper caste, middle class.This entailed, among other things, pressuring her daughter to follow, from a very young age, a regimen of personal grooming designed to make her look fairer, and unlike the stereotypically dark-skinned Dalit. Though financial hardship made it tough, Dutt became adept at living the lie. Whenever anyone asked her about her caste, she told them she was a brahmin. As for her Dalit identity, it lay “deeply buried beneath layers of convent education, urban upbringing and a hardened resolve to avoid engaging with anything related to caste.”Coming Out...covers new territory by mapping a Dalit experience that hasn’t received much attention except on Dalit platforms: the dislocation of the self that follows the suppression of one’s caste identity, and the difficult personal journey whose starting point is shame and destination is pride. Even in urban India, where caste is supposedly not an issue anymore, ‘coming out’ is not an easy option for a Dalit. For Dutt, as she herself admits, the decision was made somewhat easier by her location. By then based in New York, she knew that geographical distance insulated her to some extent from any toxic fallout.Rohit Vemula connectThe book opens with an account of what prompted Dutt to come out as a Dalit. Two weeks before Rohit Vemula hanged himself from a ceiling fan in January 2016, he had sent a Facebook friend request to Dutt. She had deleted it. She did so because she “deleted all unsolicited requests from people I didn’t have enough friends in common with.”As she sat reading his suicide note, thousands of miles away in New York, the irony wasn’t lost on Dutt. She may not have had many friends in common with Vemula. But she did have in common with him something elemental: caste. They were both Dalits. There was, however, a big difference: while Vemula wore his caste identity as a badge of pride and paid the ultimate price for it, Dutt had spent her life hiding it from the world.It was Vemula’s political commitment to Dalit dignity that triggered the chain of events which culminated in his institutional murder. On the other hand, Dutt’s success at masking her Dalit identity probably protected her from the kind of abuse that overwhelmed Vemula. As she writes, “In Rohith’s letter I saw this bizarre possibility that, under a slightly different set of circumstances, his short life could have been mine.”Exposing the lieVemula’s death and his parting words had an electrifying effect on Dalits all over the world. It also politicised a young girl who had become “so good at pretending to be upper caste that I almost forgot I was Dalit.” Until then, Dutt had lived in perpetual “fear of being caught, the fear of losing friends, respect and even my bylines.” This overarching fear made her hate herself, and to want to be someone else. “I wanted to be like my colleagues who were not hiding, not scared, not Bhangi and therefore better than me.” Vemula’s martyrdom changed all that.From being someone desperate to escape “the humiliation of being ‘discovered’ as Bhangi”, Dutt becomes someone who “was forever taking away their power” to humiliate her — by exposing the lie herself.“In a way, I was turning my Dalitness into a gold medal of ancestral pride and suffering. I was going to proclaim openly and proudly that I was DALIT.” Dutt’s Facebook post announcing her Dalit identity shocked many of her friends and acquaintances. It also changed her life in a fundamental way: “I wasn’t scared of my Dalitness anymore.”Written in lucid prose and framed by a strong commitment to Dalit rights and gender justice,Coming Out... is bound to resonate with victims of caste injustice. It will also, hopefully, sensitise the ‘caste-blind’ to the many forms of discrimination and everyday casteism that often go unchallenged.Coming Out as Dalit: A Memoir; Yashica Dutt, Aleph, ₹599."
A mixed bag in Berlin,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/a-mixed-bag-in-berlin/article26294365.ece,"
As Berlinale 2019 draws to an end today, it’s been 10 days of terrific cinema and some unexpected treasures
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In Turkish-German filmmaker Fatih Akin’s latest filmThe Golden Glove, protagonist Fritz Honka, a grotesque-looking man, picks up older, down-on-luck prostitutes from a bar he frequents. Then, in his drunken stupor, Honka beats them, strangles them, and saws their bodies into small parts.People who visit Honka’s apartment complain of the foul smell since he hides the body parts behind the walls. Akin makes the situation look so real that even the audience starts to imagine it can smell decaying human flesh.It’s is a very hard film to watch. But in the hands of a master like Akin (Head-On, 2004;The Edge of Heaven, 2007), the film becomes a strange viewing experience. One is disgusted and shocked by the images, but there is also the curiosity to see how far the director will go to project his protagonist’s depravity.Quite like it happened with Lars von Trier’sThe House That Jack Builtat Cannes last year, some people walked out of the screening ofThe Golden Gloveat this year’s Berlinale. One could sense discomfort among those who stayed back. Germans at large will have a chance to decide whether they can take so much violence when the film opens in theatres later next week.The Golden Glovewas programmed in the competition section of the 69th Berlinale. And it was one of the few hundred films playing in several categories — some brilliant and then, as it always happens in big festivals, there were others that fell relatively flat.This year, there was also a large selection of Indian films, including Zoya Akhtar’sGully Boy, Ritesh Batra’sPhotograph,and Rima Das’sBulbul Can Sing, a follow up to her National Award-winnerVillage Rockstars(2017). There were also a few shorts whileTales From Planet Kolkata, a restored 1993 documentary by London-based Indian writer Ruchir Joshi, played in the experimental Forum Expanded section.True storyAt the halfway mark to the 10-day festival,The Golden Glovestood out as a fascinating film for me. But I also liked François Ozon’sBy the Grace of God— a harrowing story of several adult men who band together to bring criminal charges against a priest who sexually abused them when they were teenagers. Based on a true story, the trial and news of which still make headlines in France, the film deals with a theme similar to the Oscar winningSpotlight(2015). But whileSpotlightworked like a thriller, set in the editorial offices ofThe Boston Globe, the French film focuses mainly on the victims, now adult men, especially three characters from different class backgrounds, and how revisiting the traumas of their youth affects their present lives.Ozon has directed nearly 40 feature-length and short films, often dealing with relationships, especially same-sex partners.By the Grace of Godis one of his more complex films — a multi-layered screenplay, with several characters coming in and out of the narrative.By all counts, the strongest film in the competition section this year was the quietOndog.Directed by Chinese filmmaker Wang Quan’an, it’s a tale of survival, sexual desires and a murder in the Mongolian steppes.Scene after scene of the stunning film shows a vast sweeping landscape with a tiny dot — sometimes a wolf and at other times, an 18-year-old policeman guarding a naked female corpse.ButOndogis not much concerned with the murder. Instead, it focuses on the way of life of a few gentle folks who live in the far-off land. A lamb is butchered for a meal, a cow delivers a calf, a single woman shepherd living in a round hut finds out she is pregnant. But life goes on.In 2007, director Wang won the Golden Bear forTuya’s Marriage.Ondogis expected to win in one of the top categories as well.Mafia movieI also watched another terrific film, based on the writing of Italian novelist Roberto Saviano who earlier captured the rise of the modern-day mafia in Naples in his 2008 filmGomorrah, and in a television series that ran from 2014 to 2016. Now, director Claudio Giovannesi has adapted a new screenplay by Saviano (also based on his book), narrating another saga of the mafia in Naples, but this time entirely from the perspective of young teenagers.The boys inPiranhasall have baby faces. They have barely crossed puberty. But led by the good-looking Nicola (Francesco Di Napoli) with his wide toothy grin, they all want to become gangsters, carrying guns to control their neighbourhood, sell drugs, protect local businesses, and command the respect usually given to older hoodlums.They ride scooters and motorcycles through the narrow cobblestoned alleys of Naples, firing guns at rival gangs, picking up girlfriends, drinking, and snorting cocaine. Life is really good for Nicola and his friends, expect that they are essentially children.Piranhasis an entertaining thriller, but at all times we have the foreboding sense that the world is going to come crashing down on these youngsters.Just childrenWhen wading through the choppy waters of a festival, one sometimes discovers films from unlikely corners. There was a buzz, but I had no idea what to expect from a Guatemalan film calledTremors. I learned that it was directed by Jayro Bustamante whose previous filmIxcanul— set among the country’s indigenous people — was Guatemala’s first official entry for the foreign language Oscar, and that it won awards at several festivals, including the Mumbai Film Festival.WithTremors(playing in the Panorama section), Bustamante moves to new territory — examining the life of a well-to-do married man with two children. But the film’s protagonist, Pablo, has a secret that he finally reveals to his family. He is in love with another man and wants to leave his family. Pablo’s announcement shocks his family, and his conservative parents, and the repercussions are felt all the way to the church the family goes to.Pablo believes he is making the right decision and that it will give him happiness, but his heart breaks when a judge forbids him from seeing his children. Much of the film focuses on Pablo’s struggles with his wife, his mother and the church. There is truly no solace in his new life until he succumbs to mounting pressures.Nobody wins in this complicated battle. But for the audience, the experience of visiting a culture vastly different from its own is very rewarding.The author is an independent writer, film festival programmer and the author ofShashi Kapoor: The Householder, The Star.Some people walked out of the screening ofThe Golden Gloveat Berlinale. One could sense discomfort in those who stayed back"

Fresh violence on residential quarters of people from the Valley living in Jammu
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Panic gripped parents in Kashmir on Saturday after they received distress calls from students living outside the State, who were allegedly receiving threats after the recent Pulwama incident.Meanwhile, amid a curfew, fresh attacks were reported on residential quarters of people from the Valley living in Jammu.A Kashmiri student studying in Dehradun told his relatives in the Valley that the landlords were asking them to vacate. Several traders and students in Haryana also alleged that mobs publicly threatened them.“Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) activists issued an ultimatum to Kashmiri students in Dehradun to leave the State. I approached the Director General of Police, Uttarakhand, Naresh Singh, and he assured us help and cooperation,” said Nasir Khuehami, a student, who is coordinating help to students facing such threats.Safety arrangementsA police spokesman in Srinagar said J&K police officials spoke to the Dehradun police and “all necessary arrangements for the safety and security of students in Dehradun were put in place.”Helplines have been set up across the Valley for students and traders living outside it. In Jammu, where curfew was imposed on Friday after rioters burnt and damaged over 40 vehicles, the situation remained tense as mobs allegedly attacked residential quarters where Kashmiris live.Secretariat Employees Union president Ghulam Rasool Mir alleged that police remained a mute spectator when mobs attacked the quarters. “There are brazen attempts to damage communal harmony and brotherhood,” he said.The Jammu Chamber of Commerce, an influential traders’ body in Jammu, asked people to maintain calm.National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti and the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) have called for “calm”.Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said, “Those in charge are obliged to ensure that the safety and security of Kashmiris is not compromised at a time when anti-Kashmir rhetoric has been ratcheted up.”"
A Dalit who stopped being a ‘brahmin’,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/a-dalit-who-stopped-being-a-brahmin/article26294405.ece,"
A personal story becomes a powerful social commentary against everyday casteism that often goes unchallenged
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Memoirs by Dalit writers tend to be documents of suffering. They are testaments of the atrocities heaped upon them by India’s indigenously developed misery-generating machine known as the caste system. But violence and humiliation are not the only forms of caste oppression. There are other, more insidious, yet equally devastating forms of abuse that caste inflicts. One such is being forced to live your life pretending to be of another caste, terrified of your true identity being discovered.Journalist Yashica Dutt’sComing Out as Dalitdocuments the torment of such a life, and how she worked up the courage to discard pretence and embrace her identity as a Dalit. The book is a mix of memoir — of a Dalit who pretends to be a brahmin, until she doesn’t — and social commentary, interspersed with brief historical fragments about the Dalit movement. The personal narrative alternates with observations on caste, “the invisible arm that turns the gears in nearly every system in our country,” in Dutt’s memorable words.Caste aspirationsDutt was born in Ajmer, Rajasthan. Her father was a civil servant with the State government. Her mother, whose dream of joining the IPS was wrecked by a difficult marriage to an alcoholic, worked a series of hard, low-paying gigs to put her children through school. What stands out in Dutt’s account of her childhood is her mother’s determination to give her children an upper caste, middle class upbringing. An integral part of her strategy to achieve that aim was to pass them off as upper caste, middle class.This entailed, among other things, pressuring her daughter to follow, from a very young age, a regimen of personal grooming designed to make her look fairer, and unlike the stereotypically dark-skinned Dalit. Though financial hardship made it tough, Dutt became adept at living the lie. Whenever anyone asked her about her caste, she told them she was a brahmin. As for her Dalit identity, it lay “deeply buried beneath layers of convent education, urban upbringing and a hardened resolve to avoid engaging with anything related to caste.”Coming Out...covers new territory by mapping a Dalit experience that hasn’t received much attention except on Dalit platforms: the dislocation of the self that follows the suppression of one’s caste identity, and the difficult personal journey whose starting point is shame and destination is pride. Even in urban India, where caste is supposedly not an issue anymore, ‘coming out’ is not an easy option for a Dalit. For Dutt, as she herself admits, the decision was made somewhat easier by her location. By then based in New York, she knew that geographical distance insulated her to some extent from any toxic fallout.Rohit Vemula connectThe book opens with an account of what prompted Dutt to come out as a Dalit. Two weeks before Rohit Vemula hanged himself from a ceiling fan in January 2016, he had sent a Facebook friend request to Dutt. She had deleted it. She did so because she “deleted all unsolicited requests from people I didn’t have enough friends in common with.”As she sat reading his suicide note, thousands of miles away in New York, the irony wasn’t lost on Dutt. She may not have had many friends in common with Vemula. But she did have in common with him something elemental: caste. They were both Dalits. There was, however, a big difference: while Vemula wore his caste identity as a badge of pride and paid the ultimate price for it, Dutt had spent her life hiding it from the world.It was Vemula’s political commitment to Dalit dignity that triggered the chain of events which culminated in his institutional murder. On the other hand, Dutt’s success at masking her Dalit identity probably protected her from the kind of abuse that overwhelmed Vemula.

Officials asked to monitor law and order, highlight Pakistan’s links to Pulwama attack, and ensure safety of Kashmiris
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"As reports of attacks on Kashmiri students and residents emerged from various places in the country, the Union Home Ministry on Saturday asked all States to take steps to ensure their safety and security. At a security review meeting on Saturday, Home Minister Rajnath Singh asked officials to highlight the involvement of Pakistan in the Pulwama terror attack as much as possible.After arson and violence was reported from Jammu city, Mr. Singh spoke to former Deputy Chief Minister of J&K Nirmal Singh and sought his assistance in maintaining peace.He then called BJP State president Ravinder Raina, and cautioned him that no one from the party should be encouraged to give speeches or statements that could further fan violence.“He was told that they should not be participants in any untoward violence,” a senior official said. “There have been some reports of students and other residents of J&K experiencing threats and intimidation in the wake of the terrorist attack in Pulwama. Therefore, the Ministry issued an advisory to all States and Union Territories to take necessary measures to ensure their safety and security,” a senior official said, quoting the advisory.Former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah met Mr. Singh and requested him to take all steps to ensure Jammu remained calm.A day ago, curfew was imposed in Jammu’s Gujjar Nagar after protesters set on fire parked vehicles in a particular community’s area during a bandh called by the Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Jammu Bar Association. A number of vehicles were damaged in Gujjar Nagar after protesters attacked them with sticks and stones, locals said.The shops of some shawl traders in Patna was vandalised by a mob wielding lathis, who gave them an ultimatum to leave the State within 24 hours.Mr. Singh chaired an all-party meeting earlier in the day and later took a review meeting where top officials including Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief A.K. Dhasmana and Home Secretary Rajiv Gauba were present.“The Home Minister told the officials that all political parties were together on the issue. The officials have been asked to monitor the law and order situation and highlight Pakistani links to the attack,” said a senior government official. It was also decided to scale down the security cover of individuals with suspected links to Pakistan."

The UN described the atrocities by the Myanmar military on Rohingya refugees as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing while the rights groups called it a genocide.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The United Nations aid agencies and partners have appealed for $920 million to help meet the “dire needs” of more than 900,000 Rohingyas who have fled to Bangladesh to escape the violence in Myanmar’s restive Rakhine State, triggering one of the world’s worst refugee crises.According to the UN estimates, over 700,000 minority Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh, where they joined roughly 200,000 others already sheltering there, since August 25 last year when the army launched a military crackdown.The 2019 Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya humanitarian crisis seeks to raise $ 920 million to assist more than 900,000 refugees from Myanmar and the more than 330,000 vulnerable Bangladeshis hosting them.“Our humanitarian imperative today is to stabilise the situation of stateless Rohingya refugees and their Bangladesh hosts. We are hoping for timely, predictable and flexible contributions in order to meet the goals of this year’s appeal,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).Critical aid and services such as food, water, sanitation and shelter represent more than half of this year’s funding needs, which include health, education, child protection and addressing sexual and gender-based violence.Nurul Amin, a 35-year-old Rohingya muslim who is on the first list for being repatriated back to Myanmar, stands for a photograph outside Jamtoli refugee camp, in Bangladesh, on Wednesday.

Afghan cinema visits Berlin Film Festival,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghan-cinema-visits-berlin-film-festival/article26294592.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Among the movies screened this year at the Berlin Film Festival were two documentaries on Afghanistan. And their importance in the context of contemporary Afghan politics could not be missed.“We wanted to share our journey and all the things we faced,” said Hassan Fazili after the premiere of his filmMidnight Traveller. Mr. Fazili and his family members filmed the refugee trail through Europe using smartphones.With much intimacy, the movie shows the struggle that many refugees face while trying to reach a safe place in Europe. By revealing details on the police brutalities faced by the people, the film also tells that violence and racism are present more than ever in the Western world.Mr. Fazili’s project was supported by professional filmmakers and editors. “We are still in this country as refugees and hope that our asylum requests get accepted soon,” Mr. Fazili said after the screening of his film. “Germany continues to deport Afghan refugees and that's terrible,” he said.Midnight Travellerdoes not solely portray the dangers of the trail to Europe. It also underlines daily life in war-torn Afghanistan, which Mr. Fazili, who had a cafe in Kabul, was forced to leave after he faced threats from militant groups.The fallen revolutionariesAnother movie at the film festival ties Afghanistan’s present to its past. InWhat We Left Unfinished, Afghan-American filmmaker Mariam Ghani — daughter of President Ashraf Ghani — discusses five propaganda movies from the 1980s produced by Kabul’s Communist regimes. The Afghan Communists came to power in 1978 after staging a bloody coup against the government of Mohammed Daoud Khan. This event, called the ‘Saur Revolution’, was the topic of some of their propaganda movie efforts. “Outside Afghanistan, many people don’t even know about the country’s Communist history. And even among many Afghans, it’s barely understood,” said Ms. Ghani.She believes that the movies from that time reflected the lives of a narrow group of people and the urban elites who referred to themselves as the “enlightened people”. In all these films, the Communists are portrayed as “revolutionaries” defending the country against ‘barbarians’ and ‘foreign stooges’.Ms. Ghani and her team visited actors and directors who had worked in the propaganda films. Some of their interviewees were all praise for the 1980s Kabul and described the period as a ‘golden era’ for Afghan cinema. “I think it’s difficult to expect that anyone today will tell you faithfully how they felt about it at that time...” Ms. Ghani said. “Now, we all know what was really happening. The historical facts are clear.”According to Ali M. Latifi, the film’s field producer, some of the people they interviewed did not try to hide their sympathies for Kabul’s Communist regimes, which killed and tortured hundreds of thousands of people.Ms. Ghani had extensive access to the ‘Afghan Film Archive’ in Kabul, where many Communist films and other material are stored. In 2018, the archive was moved to the presidential palace in Kabul. Some Afghans criticised this step and the role played by Ms. Ghani, who had been working on the project for years, in the move. However, according to the Brooklyn-based filmmaker, the aim was to digitise the whole archive, including all the finished and unfinished films, as soon as possible, and share it with the Afghan public. She believes that the more the films travel, the greater the impact they will have as history lessons and tools for reconciliation.Two films, one on refugees finding their way to Europe and the other on propaganda cinema made by Afghan Communists, narrate stories of the nation’s scarred past and its troubled present"
Two States only just solution for Israel-Palestine conflict: UN chief,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-states-only-just-solution-for-israel-palestine-conflict-un-chief/article26288901.ece,"
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, that there is no plan B.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A “peaceful and just solution” to the longstanding Israel-Palestine conflict can only be achieved through creation of two States living side-by-side in peace and security, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, asserting that there is no plan B.In his address to the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, which was established by the UN General Assembly in 1975, Mr. Guterres said on Friday that “based on relevant UN resolutions, long-held principles, previous agreements and international law”, Jerusalem should be the capital of both States.“Unfortunately, over this past year, the situation has not moved in that direction”, he rued, pointing to protests that began along the border fence with Gaza last year that left hundreds dead and thousands wounded by Israeli security forces.He also cited “security incidents and provocations by Hamas and other militants in Gaza”, including the launching of rockets and incendiary kites that dangerously escalated the situation.“Thanks to the UN and Egyptian mediation efforts, a major escalation was avoided”, he said, appealing to Hamas authorities in Gaza to “prevent provocations”.The UN chief said under International Humanitarian Law Israel too has a responsibility to exercise “maximum restraint”, except as a last resort.Mr. Guterres said he regretted Israel’s decision not to renew the mandate of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron, saying “I hope an agreement can be found by the parties to preserve this long-standing and valuable arrangement”.“Palestinians have endured more than a half-century of occupation and denial of their legitimate right to self-determination” with both sides continuously suffering from “deadly cycles of violence”, the Secretary-General said.He indicated that leaders bore the responsibility to reverse this negative trajectory and pave the way toward peace, stability and reconciliation.Mr. Guterres praised the Committee for keeping the focus on the ultimate objective of a “peaceful solution with two States coexisting in peace and security” as the only way to achieve the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.“As I have said repeatedly, there is no Plan B,” Mr. Guterres said.He underscored that the UN firmly supports Palestinian reconciliation and “the return of the legitimate Palestinian Government to Gaza” as “an integral part of a future Palestinian State”.Noting that the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza must be immediately addressed, he detailed that some two million Palestinians remained mired in increasing poverty and unemployment, with limited access to adequate health, education, water and electricity, leaving young people with “little prospect of a better future”.“I urge Israel to lift restrictions on the movement of people and goods, which also hamper the efforts of the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies, without naturally jeopardising legitimate security concerns,” Mr. Guterres said.Lauding the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) for its “critical work” in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and across the region, he called on the international community to “significantly” increase efforts to revitalise Gaza’s economy.Touching upon the risk of further unrest in the West Bank, the UN chief flagged that Israeli construction and settlement plans have expanded, including in East Jerusalem.“Settlements are illegal under international law”, he asserted.“They deepen the sense of mistrust and undermine the two-State solution”."

A gunman opened fire killing five people and wounding five police officers before he was slain, law enforcement officials said.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A gunman opened fire at a manufacturing warehouse in Aurora, Illinois, on Friday, killing five people and wounding five police officers before he was slain, law enforcement officials said.Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said the shooter, identified as 45-year-old Gary Martin, worked at the sprawling industrial complex in Aurora, 40 miles (65 km) west of Chicago, but did not say what may have motivated the attack.The Chicago Sun-Times newspaper reported that a woman who identified herself to police as Martin's mother told authorities her son had been laid off from his job two weeks ago and had been “way too stressed out” before Friday's shooting.“Today is a sad day in the city of Aurora,” Mayor Richard Irvin told reporters.Also ReadGunman in Aurora, Illinois, shooting described as ‘loner’Ms. Ziman said police received multiple emergency calls at 1:24 p.m. reporting an active shooter at the manufacturing plant. The first officers arrived on the scene four minutes later and two of them were immediately struck by gunfire, she said.Five officers were shot and wounded, Ms. Ziman said, before the gunman was killed by police returning fire. A sixth officer suffered a knee injury.Inside the building, five civilians were found dead.

Some Kashmiri students and traders in Haryana reportedly called up their parents and relatives in Shopian and Kupwara, saying they were harassed.A police spokesman in Srinagar said they had spoken to the Dehradun police. “The Dehradun police are in touch with the representative of Kashmir-based boys and all necessary arrangements for the safety and security of the students in Dehradun have been put in place,” he said.Also ReadMHA asks States to ensure safety of Kashmiri studentsPolice have set up helplines in most districts of the Kashmir Valley for students and traders in case of any exigency outside the State.Curfew in JammuIn Jammu, curfew continued for the second day on Saturday, with reports of attacks in residential areas housing Kashmiri-speaking people.There was tension on Friday despite the Jammu Chamber of Commerce's call to maintain calm.“There has been constant attempt to stone our quarters since the morning. Curfew has failed to deter mobsters from hurling stones at Kashmiris' residential quarters. It smacks of leniency shown by the police towards mobsters,” alleged a Kashmiri, who reportedly lives in a government residential quarters in Janipur area.President of the Secretariat Employees Union Ghulam Rasool Mir alleged that police remained silent spectators when mobs entered the quarters. “There are brazen attempts to damage the communal harmony and brotherhood,” he said.On Friday, over 50 vehicles of a particular community were either set on fire or smashed by mobs protesting against thePulwama killing of CRPF jawans.An Army spokesman said Army personnel were helping the civil authorities in maintaining law and order in Jammu. “Eighteen columns have been deployed in Gujjar Nagar, Janipur, Shahidi Chowk, Talab Khatika, Sidhra and other sensitive areas.

There are reports of violence in Jammu and tension in the university and on college campuses in some States. I would have expected an appeal for calm along with condemnation and condolences,” said Mr. Abdullah.Ms Mufti said, “In this time of grief and outrage, attempts will be made to divide us. Our pain must not fuel such diabolical plans. Because eventually, the axe forgets but the tree remembers.”Several traders' bodies in the Kashmir Valley, including the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Forum and Kashmir Economic Alliance, have called for a shutdown on Sunday for the alleged attacks on Kashmiris."

The Congress will send a delegation of senior leaders to Jammu and Kashmir in coming days. Former J&K Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is likely to leave for Pulwama on Saturday to take stock of the situation.Calling it an attack on India’s soul, Mr. Gandhi said the forces behind the attack should not feel that India would forget the deaths of its men. “No force, no amount of hatred, no amount of anger can harm the love and affection that our country is built on,” he said.Mr. Gandhi refused to answer a question on the comments by many Ministers blaming the Opposition and peaceniks. “I don’t want to get into these comments. I am very clear, I am hurt and every single Indian is hurt,” he said.Dr. Singh also reiterated the need to stand by the government in this tough time and not to raise “contentious issues”. “Today is a day of mourning, our country has lost 40 jawans. Our foremost duty is to convey to the families that we are with them. In condemning the act of terror, I also want to say that we will never compromise with terrorism,” he said.Mr. Gandhi later went to the Palam airport when the mortal remains of the CRPF personnel were flown in.Left seeks dialogueThe CPI(M) Polit Bureau headed by party general secretary Sitaram Yechury said violence was not the answer to resolve issues that required the engagement of all stakeholders in the State. “The Modi government had promised, three years ago, to initiate a political process involving all stakeholders through a dialogue. This has not happened. This must be done immediately,” the Polit Bureau said in a statement.CPI national secretary D.

Trump declares national emergency to build border wall,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-declares-national-emergency-to-build-border-wall/article26284327.ece,"
Trump made the announcement from the Rose Garden, as he claimed illegal immigration was “an invasion of our country.”
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Battling with one branch of government and opening a new confrontation with another, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Friday he was declaring a national emergency to fulfill his pledge to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Bypassing Congress, which approved far less money for his proposed wall than he had sought, Mr. Trump said he would use executive action to siphon billions of dollars from federal military construction and counterdrug efforts for the wall, aides said. The move is already drawing bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill and expected to face rounds of legal challenges.Mr. Trump made the announcement from the Rose Garden, as he claimed illegal immigration was “an invasion of our country.”Mr. Trump’s move followed a rare show of bipartisanship when lawmakers voted on Thursday to fund large swaths of the government and avoid a repeat of this winter’s debilitating five-week government shutdown. The money in the bill for border barriers, about $1.4 billion, is far below the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump insisted he needed and would finance just a quarter of the more than 200 miles he wanted this year.To bridge the gap, Mr. Trump announced that he will be spending roughly $8 billion on border barriers combining the money approved by Congress with funding he plans to repurpose through executive actions, including the national emergency. The money is expected to come from funds targeted for military construction and counterdrug efforts, but aides could not immediately specify which military projects would be affected.Despite widespread opposition in Congress to proclaiming an emergency, including by some Republicans, Mr. Trump was responding to pressure to act unilaterally to soothe his conservative base and avoid appearing like he’s lost his wall battle.Word that Mr. Trump would declare the emergency prompted condemnations from Democrats and threats of lawsuits from states and others who might lose federal money or said Trump was abusing his authority.In a sing-songy tone of voice, Mr. Trump described how the decision will be challenged and work its way through the courts, including up to the U.S. Supreme Court.In an unusual joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it an “unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist” and said it “does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation.”“The President’s actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution,” they said. “The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.”Democratic state attorneys general said they’d consider legal action to block Trump. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello told the president on Twitter “we’ll see you in court” if he made the declaration.Even if his emergency declaration withstands challenge, Mr. Trump is still billions of dollars short of his overall funding needed to build the wall as he promised in 2016. After two years of effort, Mr. Trump has not added any new border mileage; all of the construction so far has gone to replacing and repairing existing structures. Ground is expected to be broken in South Texas soon on the first new mileage.The White House said Mr. Trump would not try to redirect federal disaster aid to the wall, a proposal they had considered but rejected over fears of a political blowback."

I have asked officers to review the security of those people who take money from Pakistan,” Mr. Singh added.After chairing a security review meeting with top officials in Srinagar, Mr. Singh also revised the standard operating procedure for convoy movement in the Valley.“Civilian vehicles will be halted till convoy passes. Civilians will have to cooperate,” said Mr. Singh.Reacting to new SOP, former chief minister and National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah suggested to use special chartered trains between Banihal and Baramulla instead. “This move will be able to allow movement at high speed non-stop and they will be much safer than convoys. Also highways will be available for civilian traffic,” he said.Commenting on violence in Jammu where 12 civilians were injured and scores of vehicles burnt by protesters, the minister said the State administration will take stern action against those trying to disrupt peace and damaging the communal fabric.Curfew in JammuMeanwhile, the District Magistrate of Jammu on Friday ordered imposition of curfew in Jammu city “to maintain law and order, public tranquillity and to protect life and property of general public”.The move comes after protesters, mainly right-wring groups in Jammu, first held a protest rally in a particular community’s area in the old city and later allegedly clashed and set several vehicles on fire.NC’s Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti sought intervention of Mr. Singh defuse tension in Jammu. “It should never have been allowed to reach this point. Pre-emptive measures should have been taken this morning knowing that it is Friday and congregations would assemble for prayers,” said Mr. Abdullah.Jammu witnessed a shutdown on the call of Jammu Chambers of Commerce and Jammu Bar Association to protest against the killing of 37 CRPF jawans in the Pulwama attack.“It will be a travesty and against the spirit of our secular ethno-cultural values to use this terror attack as an excuse to target minorities. I am distressed to hear about miscreants in Jammu trying to take advantage of the situation by inciting tension. The governor’s administration should have preempted this by securing minority dominated areas,” said Ms. Mufti."

",,"Pakistan on Thursday said the terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pulwama district is “a matter of grave concern” even as it strongly rejected Indian media and government’s allegations of the country’s link to the strike “without” probe.In one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir’s three decades of militancy, a suicide bomber from the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus in Pulwama district on Thursday, killing at least 39 personnel and leaving many critically wounded.Attack in Pulwama in Kashmir is “a matter of grave concern”, the Pakistan government said in a statement.Asserting that Pakistan has “always condemned acts of violence” anywhere in the world, it said, “We strongly reject any insinuation by elements in the Indian media and government that seek to link the attack to Pakistan without investigations.”Stop supporting terrorists, India tells PakMeanwhile, India slammed Pakistan over the Pulwama terror attack carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed and asked the neighbouring country to stop supporting terrorists and dismantle terror infrastructure operating from its soil.India also strongly reiterated its appeal to all members of the international community to support the proposal to list terrorists, including JeM chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council, and to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan.The Indian government condemns in the strongest possible terms the cowardly terrorist attack on India’s brave security forces in Pulwama, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.This heinous and despicable act has been perpetrated by Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based terrorist organisation proscribed by the United Nations and other countries, it said.This terror group is led by the international terrorist Masood Azhar, who has been given full freedom by the Pakistani government to operate and expand his terror infrastructure in territories under Pakistan’s control and to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere with impunity, the MEA said."
Berlinale 2019: a mixed bag,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/berlinale-2019-a-mixed-bag/article26279420.ece,"
Ten days of terrific cinema and some unexpected treasures at the international film festival in Berlin ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In Turkish-German filmmaker Fatih Akin’s latest filmThe Golden Glove, protagonist Fritz Honka, a grotesque-looking man, picks up older, down-on-luck prostitutes from a bar he frequents. Then, in his drunken stupor, Honka beats them, strangles them, and saws their bodies into small parts.People who visit Honka’s apartment complain of the foul smell since he hides the body parts behind the walls. Akin makes the situation look so real that even the audience starts to imagine it can smell decaying human flesh.It’s is a very hard film to watch. But in the hands of a master like Akin (Head-On, 2004;The Edge of Heaven, 2007), the film becomes a strange viewing experience. One is disgusted and shocked by the images, but there is also the curiosity to see how far the director will go to project his protagonist’s depravity.Quite like it happened with Lars von Trier’sThe House That Jack Builtat Cannes last year, some people walked out of the screening ofThe Golden Gloveat this year’s Berlinale. One could sense discomfort among those who stayed back. Germans at large will have a chance to decide whether they can take so much violence when the film opens in theatres later next week.Still from The Golden GloveThe Golden Glovewas programmed in the competition section of the 69th Berlinale. And it was one of the few hundred films playing in several categories — some brilliant and then, as it always happens in big festivals, there were others that fell relatively flat.This year, there was also a large selection of Indian films, including Zoya Akhtar’sGully Boy, Ritesh Batra’sPhotograph,and Rima Das’sBulbul Can Sing, a follow up to her National Award-winnerVillage Rockstars(2017). There were also a few shorts whileTales From Planet Kolkata, a restored 1993 documentary by London-based Indian writer Ruchir Joshi, played in the experimental Forum Expanded section.True storyAt the halfway mark to the 10-day festival,The Golden Glovestood out as a fascinating film for me. But I also liked François Ozon’sBy the Grace of God— a harrowing story of several adult men who band together to bring criminal charges against a priest who sexually abused them when they were teenagers. Based on a true story, the trial and news of which still make headlines in France, the film deals with a theme similar to the Oscar winningSpotlight(2015). But whileSpotlightworked like a thriller, set in the editorial offices ofThe Boston Globe, the French film focuses mainly on the victims, now adult men, especially three characters from different class backgrounds, and how revisiting the traumas of their youth affects their present lives.Ozon has directed nearly 40 feature-length and short films, often dealing with relationships, especially same-sex partners.By the Grace of Godis one of his more complex films — a multi-layered screenplay, with several characters coming in and out of the narrative.By all counts, the strongest film in the competition section this year was the quietOndog.Directed by Chinese filmmaker Wang Quan’an, it’s a tale of survival, sexual desires and a murder in the Mongolian steppes.Scene after scene of the stunning film shows a vast sweeping landscape with a tiny dot — sometimes a wolf and at other times, an 18-year-old policeman guarding a naked female corpse.ButOndogis not much concerned with the murder. Instead, it focuses on the way of life of a few gentle folks who live in the far-off land. A lamb is butchered for a meal, a cow delivers a calf, a single woman shepherd living in a round hut finds out she is pregnant. But life goes on.In 2007, director Wang won the Golden Bear forTuya’s Marriage.Ondogis expected to win in one of the top categories as well.Mafia movieI also watched another terrific film, based on the writing of Italian novelist Roberto Saviano who earlier captured the rise of the modern-day mafia in Naples in his 2008 filmGomorrah, and in a television series that ran from 2014 to 2016. Now, director Claudio Giovannesi has adapted a new screenplay by Saviano (also based on his book), narrating another saga of the mafia in Naples, but this time entirely from the perspective of young teenagers.The boys inPiranhasall have baby faces. They have barely crossed puberty. But led by the good-looking Nicola (Francesco Di Napoli) with his wide toothy grin, they all want to become gangsters, carrying guns to control their neighbourhood, sell drugs, protect local businesses, and command the respect usually given to older hoodlums.Still from PiranhasThey ride scooters and motorcycles through the narrow cobblestoned alleys of Naples, firing guns at rival gangs, picking up girlfriends, drinking, and snorting cocaine. Life is really good for Nicola and his friends, expect that they are essentially children.Piranhasis an entertaining thriller, but at all times we have the foreboding sense that the world is going to come crashing down on these youngsters.Just childrenWhen wading through the choppy waters of a festival, one sometimes discovers films from unlikely corners. There was a buzz, but I had no idea what to expect from a Guatemalan film calledTremors. I learned that it was directed by Jayro Bustamante whose previous filmIxcanul— set among the country’s indigenous people — was Guatemala’s first official entry for the foreign language Oscar, and that it won awards at several festivals, including the Mumbai Film Festival.WithTremors(playing in the Panorama section), Bustamante moves to new territory — examining the life of a well-to-do married man with two children. But the film’s protagonist, Pablo, has a secret that he finally reveals to his family. He is in love with another man and wants to leave his family. Pablo’s announcement shocks his family, and his conservative parents, and the repercussions are felt all the way to the church the family goes to.Still from TremorsPablo believes he is making the right decision and that it will give him happiness, but his heart breaks when a judge forbids him from seeing his children. Much of the film focuses on Pablo’s struggles with his wife, his mother and the church. There is truly no solace in his new life until he succumbs to mounting pressures.Nobody wins in this complicated battle. But for the audience, the experience of visiting a culture vastly different from its own is very rewarding.The author is an independent writer, film festival programmer and the author ofShashi Kapoor: The Householder, The Star."

We are deeply shocked by this attack. We express deep condolences and sympathy to the injured and bereaved families.""In a statement in New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs called upon “all members of the international community to support the proposal to list terrorists, including JeM Chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council and to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan”."

For those in China and Pakistan who will call for more evidence, the writing, like the signature of the group, is on the wall.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Every February, security agencies put out heightened alert warnings in Jammu and Kashmir, as they expect terror groups operating there to target security forces and installations around the date of February 9, whenParliament attack convict Afzal Guru was hanged.Groups like the JeM (Jaish-e-Mohammed) and LeT (Lashkar-e-Taiba) glorify him, as much for his perceived role in the attack in December 2001 that killed nine guards and Parliament staff, as much as to renew the perception in the Kashmir Valley that he was not given a proper burial and the full process of appeals.As a result, the JeM’s “Afzal Gurusquad” has made a point of leaving their signature at several attacks linked to them: letters in blood, charcoal notes on the wall with his name were found first in May 2014 when the Indian consulate at Herat in Afghanistan was attacked and then in a series of strikes on Army and CRPF camps along the LoC and International Border, Mohra and Tangdhar in north Kashmir and in Kathua and Samba in Jammu division the next year.At the same time as it carried out thePathankot airbase attack in January 2016, JeM terrorists attacked the Indian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan, leaving behind notes on Afzal Guru as they had with the others, “one martyr, a thousand fidayeen”.Also ReadPulwama suicide attack death toll likely to cross 40, Rajnath to visit SrinagarIt is significant that in thePulwama attack videos, the attacker, identified as Adil Ahmed Dar, a local, is shown surrounded by weapons and grenades, but doesn’t mention Afzal Guru himself. However, the group that put the videos out after editing and completing them, added a scroll that said “AGS (Afzal Guru Squad).Officials say they are still investigating the link to the group, but it seems clear that the attack falls in line with other attacks planned by Masood Azhar and his JeM: within a few months of him being released in exchange for hostages on board flight IC-814 on December 31, 1999, the JeM carried out a suicide car bomb attack on the Army Headquarters in Srinagar (May 2000) and a similar attack on the Srinagar legislature (September 2001), which killed 39 people. The Parliament attack just a few months later was carried out by the JeM as well, although more recent studies have indicated that it was working with elements of the Pakistani army to force a situation that would allow Islamabad to withdraw forces from its border with Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden was able to slip away despite being cornered in the Tora Bora standoff.That Azhar was responsible for the IC-814 hijacking is proven beyond doubt, and has been accepted by himself in his book (From Imprisonment to Freedom), recounting his time in Indian jails from 1993-1999.Despite what appears to be a mountain of evidence since then, as well as the banning of the JeM itself, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has failed to ban Azhar and put him on its 1267/1373 lists of banned terrorists.Themain obstacle at present is China,which has vetoed the banning on at least three occasions as it maintains there is “no consensus” on the issue.Also ReadPulwama attack: Suicide bomber used slip road to join CRPF convoyThe second reason is Pakistan itself, which has allowed Azhar to settle as a civilian in the Punjabi city of Bahawalpur, and does not prevent him from holding rallies to recruit militants, particularly in the name of Afzal Guru, whom he often quotes in books and speeches. This, despite him being accused of a car bomb assassination attempt on former Pakistan President Musharraf as well.Some blame also rests on the India’s lack of focus post 26/11, when it strengthened efforts towards the prosecution of LeT founder Hafiz Saeed.Azhar came back on the radar only after the Pathankot attack in January 2016. India renewed its efforts to have him banned, and protested China’s attempts to block the UNSC application.After the Wuhan summit between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping, however, India’s concerns on Azhar, a visible irritant in ties, once again slipped through the mentions, as the two countries attempted to build their relations again.Azhar, JeM and the Afzal Guru Squad are back in the limelight again after the Pulwama attack, and India is likely to work with the U.S., the United Kingdom and others once again to put Azhar onto the ban list with details of the attack. For those in China and Pakistan who will call for more evidence, the writing, like the signature of the group, is on the wall."

Kumaraswamy for what they called “instigating his party workers to indulge in violence”, the agitating BJP activists demanded the Chief Minister’s resignation. “What the Janata Dal(S) activists did in Hassan was nothing but goondaism. Mr. Kumaraswamy and his family members themselves instigated their party workers to attack the residence of BJP MLA Preetam Gowda. Mr. Kumaraswamy should realise that he is the Chief Minister not just for Janata Dal(S) activists alone, but all the people of the State. If he himself provokes his party workers to physically attack his political opponents, the State would turn into a goonda raj.

"I deal only with individuals. Even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined: Aparna Sen",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-deal-only-with-individuals-even-if-an-ism-surfaces-it-is-not-underlined/article26272530.ece,"
In a freewheeling chat, ace actor-director Aparna Sen talks about the importance of creative freedom, the subtext in her narratives, and how the actor and director in her inform each other ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Like her films, Aparna Sen has a lot to say. Like her films, it is seldom on the surface; it is only when you process it that you get the essence. The celebrated actor-director was in Delhi recently to participate in an international symposium on ‘Creativity and Freedom’, organised by the Kolkata-based CIMA Gallery, Ashoka University and India International Centre. As a film writer, one is always keen to know what was playing on the director’s mind when she shaped certain characters. For Aparna, one has a long list. From trivial details like why did she name the photographer in “Paroma” as Rahul Rai? Did the fact that Aparna was herself photographed by a celebrated photographer for Life magazine play on her mind when she was writing the Rakhee-starrer? Aparna says, “no”, with a smile. She reveals that she met Raghu Rai much later though she was aware of his work. During the course of the interview, she admits that some things that exist in the subconscious mind do slip into the narrative. Perhaps, it addresses the more complex questions like the bond between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law in her “Paromitar Ek Din” (House of Memories) or giving a woman agency in a communal riot-like situation in “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”.Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the theme: ‘Creativity and Freedom’?Well, not only cinema but in every sphere! I believe this is the raging topic of the day because your creative freedom is being suppressed in so many areas. At the drop of a hat, people have begun to take offence. You can’t write, paint, make films without worrying about some faction or other whose ‘sentiments’ will be hurt! If you critique the state of affairs in your country in any way, you are branded an anti-national. Freedom of expression, which is a fundamental democratic right granted to us by our constitution, is under threat today.Many different groups of people have become more sensitive than they used to be. They are well within their rights to object to something a filmmaker may have said, but they often indulge in rioting or vandalising cinema halls or forcibly stopping entry into theatres. The various state governments, which should be dealing with such law and order problems, put a stay on the release of the film. For a creative person, the atmosphere is stifling!Rahul Bose and Konkana Sensharma in Aparna Sen's English film ""Mr. and Mrs. Iyer"".Did you ever face censorship?During ‘Mr. and Mrs. Iyer’, some dialogues were cut out in Mumbai and Pune if I remember correctly. The consensus was that what had been said about Muslims in the film would enrage them and create law and order problems. But you have to take into account the intent of the film. One person or a character saying something derogatory about a Muslim doesn’t mean that the filmmaker herself is against the community. In fact, she is trying to say that such comments should not be made. Unfortunately, a scene or a piece of dialogue in a film is taken out of context and judged.Your films had female characters at the centre of the narrative much before it became a trend. What were your concerns?Look, I make films about individuals. But I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act. But I don’t make a film as a platform for my politics. My real interest is the psychology of the individual. The individual herself is part of the system, part of many converging political ideologies. When I make a film about a woman, it is possible that my feminist politics surfaces somewhere but it is not with the intention of propagating feminism. I certainly am a feminist but, in my cinema, I don’t talk about any ‘isms’. I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How it has evolved over the years and if we could compare it with the present?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films. But most of them and many feminist filmmakers, in particular, were talking about women negotiating space for themselves in a male-dominated society. Women were mostly shown as persons trying to fulfil their own potential. A notable exception is ‘Mahanagar’ by Satyajit Ray. Here you find a very early feminist narrative where the man and the woman are treated as equal. At the end of the film, when both are without jobs, both stand looking out at the city stretched out before them, and the husband says, ‘In such a great metropolis, surely at least one of us will find a job?’ They are treated as equals by the filmmaker. Even if one of them finds a job, they can function as a family. It is one of the best feminist films I have ever seen.After that, it was more about women trying to realising their own potential and their fight to do so. Any talk about female desire or sexual choice was strictly taboo. That’s why in 1985, my second film ‘Paroma’ created such a furore! Many people wanted it taken out of theatres. They felt that women’s freedom didn’t mean licence for adultery! My point is, licence according to whom? The male-dominated patriarchal system where the moment a woman exercises her sexual choice, it is called a ‘licence?’Today, the situation is completely different. Women filmmakers are now very comfortable in their shoes. They are critiquing women even. They are comfortable making films about male characters, who are persecuted by other males or even females. Alankrita Shrivastava addressed the issue of female desire in ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’. Konkona Sen Sharma made a film (‘Death in the Gunj’) about a young man where the macho world around him bullies him so much that he commits suicide.Film Director and Actress Aparna Sen  
| Photo Credit:R_Shivaji RaoThere is a lot of subtext in your narratives; one could draw different meanings...‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ was about an Anglo-Indian school teacher and her dilemma about remaining in India. She chooses to remain. There is no jingoism here. She is not talking about her motherland,which she will not leave because she is patriotic. It was simply a personal decision of a woman who is unwilling to leave a place she has known all her life. She opts for the country that she was born and brought up in. In that sense, she is a true Indian. So, you can read the text that way too, if you wish. But I made it as a human being’s personal choice, which I find much more interesting. ‘Paroma’ was about a woman who exercised her personal choice and in the process came across the wrath of the family. Eventually, she realises who she is. She realises that she is a person in her own right. To that extent, it was about a woman discovering her own identity.Film director Mrinal Sen
 
| Photo Credit:SUSHANTA PATRONOBISHIn “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”, the female protagonist rises above the barriers of caste and religion for a bigger cause.She was going to Kolkata, and she didn’t know that the bus would be caught in a riot. Had she known, she would not have gone. I didn’t plan to make the characters as Hindu and Muslim to start with. I was just going to make a love story about two strangers who meet during a journey. They surfaced because of my deep involvement with secular politics. Meenakshi Iyer tells the rioters that she is the wife of her co-passenger, who is a Muslim, just to save his life. She herself had not known until that moment she would do so! In a physical journey, which is a wonderful metaphor for a journey into oneself, the woman discovers that humanity is more important to her than her caste or religion or gender identities. In spite of so much corruption and violence around us, I still have a deep and abiding faith in human goodness.In some of your films, we find women smoking? Isn’t it bad for both men and women?Of course, it is! But, people do smoke in real life you know! In any case, I haven't shown women smoking that much in my films. Some women do smoke, yes.For a long time, women smoking publicly became a kind of political statement. But, of course, it is bad for you. In ‘Paroma’, one of my characters smokes, but she is not the central character. In ‘Sati’, ‘Yugant’ or ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’, or ‘The Japanese Wife’,for instance, there are no such scenes.In ‘Sonata’, you resisted giving a name to the simmering desire between two women...There really was no ‘simmering desire’. There was just the hint of a grey area. It is left open. I like to leave such things open. Why should I always tell the audience what to think?How much do you invest in your characters?Hugely. In the process of fleshing them out in the script, they take on a life of their own. I had planned on having Violet Stoneham of ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ to go away to Australia in the end. That was then the reality of India in 1981. Anglo-Indians migrated all the time to England, or Australia, New Zealand or Canada. But I just couldn’t make her go! I get very to my characters. In ‘Yugant’, which many outside of Bengal haven’t seen, the dissolution of a marriage was used as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the earth. The couple there were called Deepak and Anusuya. When I was making the film, the shooting went on for a long time as we had no money. In between, I was in New Jersey with my husband and suddenly one night, I started crying. When he asked why, I said, I was missing them so much. He asked, “Who?” ‘Deepak and Anusuya,’ I said, ‘I haven't seen them for so long!’ I get emotionally involved with my characters. I care about how they think. They indicate to me how they should behave or what their dialogue should be.Do the actor and director reside in two different compartments in your body?They merge. The actor comes to the fore when I am writing. I write dialogue, which very few actors have difficulty in speaking. because when I am writing, the actor in me is silently acting it all out in her mind. And when I am directing actors, the actor in me is very helpful. I know exactly what problem the actor is facing. I understand the physical and motivational problems of the actors. If an actor asks me “Why am I saying this?” I can usually tell the actor how he or she can motivate himself/ herself.Is there ever a clash?Only when I am acting and directing at the same time. I had a problem in ‘Sonata’ as I had to keep running to the monitor after giving a shot.What are your memories of Mrinal Sen?To me, he was always a young man, even when he was old. He was mentally the youngest person I have known. Always ready to try something new, always fresh. That was the most wonderful thing about him. He was not afraid of experimenting and that is so necessary in order to develop the language of cinema. He tried to experiment with cinematic form and language as well as subject matter. I worked with him in two films, but he and his wife were family friends as well – friends of my parents.You also tried to experiment in Arshinagar...It is not an easy path because when you are experimenting, you are running into orthodox thought.Like you, it seems Konkona also loves to explore the psychological space of charactersHer form is not too different, but hers is a new voice with a new perspective. She is another person.Is her style more technical?No, I don’t think it is technical. It is removed from the classical format. In the classical format, there is a beginning, a middle and an end. She opens with two people looking into the boot of a car, which is interesting because it is dramatic and intriguing with no formal 'introduction' to the characters as such.Why don't you make films in Hindi?I would love to make a film in Hindi. I don’t want to make it with stars though. I have tried that but it is a pain to pursue stars. In any case, markets are not as star-driven as they used to be. They are much more content driven now.What are you working on?I am making an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Ghare Bairey’(The Home and the World). I have called it ‘Ghaire Bairey Aaj’,because itis set against a contemporary backdrop. It is about how the world outside impacts relationships at home. I don’t want to talk more about it beforehand. I hope it will release in April."

We must all stand up against these jihadists and their ideology,” Democratic Congresswoman and Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard said.Condemning the attack, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel said, “Countries must not allow terrorist groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed to operate with impunity.”“The United States stands strongly with India and I send my condolences to the families of the victims,” Congressman Tom Suozzi whose Congressional district in New York City (Queens) has a significant Indian population, said.Congressman George Holding, co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for India and Indian Americans also offered his condolences. “The United States stands with the good people of India and the Indian government in our collective effort to end violent extremism and terrorism.”Indian American Members of Congress also conveyed their condolences with Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal calling the attack “heartbreaking” and her colleague, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, saying, “We must all stand united against terrorism.”"

In a pluralistic society beliefs and rituals are very important. Being a secular-democratic party, the Congress can take only such a stand,” he said.‘A place of violence’The Left Democractic Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party tried to make Sabarimala a place of violence like Ayodhya. The LDF was using the Sabarimala issue to divert the attention of people from its failure to mitigate sufferings of the flood-hit in the State, he said.“Sabarimala will not be the prime campaign issue for the Congress. The miseries created for the country by the fascist regime of Narendra Modi at the Centre and the anti-people policies of the Pinarayi Vijayan government will be our main issues,” Mr. Ramachandran said.Farmers were in misery. The flood-hit people were yet to get the relief. The Kerala Protection March was just a political gimmick, he added.“Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury who used to vehemently protest against mob lynching incidents should make clear whether Shukoor murder was a case of mob lynching or not.

They raised slogans against the JD(S) leaders and alleged that they were engaged in ‘goondagiri’ to take on political opponents. BJP leaders said the party would stand by its MLA and support him in his fight against the JD(S) in the district.H.Yogaramesh, district president of the BJP, said the JD(S) leaders were behind the incident in which a BJP worker suffered injuries. “Preetham Gowda won Hassan Assembly segment against the JD(S) and he does not hail from any political family. The JD(S) leaders want to scuttle his growth in public life through acts like this. The party will be with the MLA and support him”, he said.The BJP activists also blamed the district police for the incident. “If the MLA and his family members have no safety, how could common people of the city have faith in the police? Even after the incident, the police have failed to act. The police have weakened the case by not registering the case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC”, Mr. Yogaramesh said.

Addressing the protest meet, B.Y. Raghavendra, Shivamogga MP, alleged that JD(S) leaders were trying to intimidate their political opponents. He alleged that the miscreants who indulged in unlawful acts near the residence of Mr. Gowda were instigated by Chief Minister H.D.

Letters,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/letters/article26275423.ece,,,"Reservation maniaThere seems to be a reservation mania in India (“Rajasthan clears 5% quota for Gujjars”, Feb. 14). The hope was that with time reservations would be phased out gradually. What is happening is exactly the opposite. Communities have realised that they can get any government to accept their demands. The scant regard for the upper limit mandated by the Supreme Court is highly reprehensible.K.V. Seetharamaiah,HassanTwist in ParliamentIt was strange to see the same Mulayam Singh Yadav who had tried to save Muslims in 1990 say that he hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will come back to power, even as chants of ‘Jai Shree Ram’ rang in the Lok Sabha (“MPs bid adieu amid Mulayam’s twist”, Feb. 14). Politicians are so unpredictable. I wonder what pushed Mr. Yadav to say this, especially when his son is fighting against the BJP. Are father and son going different ways? His statement undermines the SP’s credibility.B. Ganga Raju,HyderabadSetting a precedentM.A. Sneha has taken a courageous step; hopefully more people will follow suit (“It’s official: Tirupattur woman gets ‘no caste, no religion’ certificate”, Feb. 14). Defining nationality is more than enough on official documents; the more barriers we strike down, the better our chance of moving towards an egalitarian society.Selvakumar A.,ChennaiIncitement to violenceThe writer is right when he says the verdict is unsustainable (“Dealing with the thought police”, Feb. 14). But if individuals are unsatisfied with the state, they can peacefully protest, organise themselves, put pressure on the government to heed their demands, use established laws to seek redress, etc. But isn’t holding radical literature dangerous? Where does incitement to violence begin? Every action originates from such ideas. It’s not always political compulsion but the need to keep citizens safe and secure that makes the state aggressive at times.Kishor Bansal,NoidaRevolutionary proposalI doubt the U.S. Congress will approve the Green New Deal (“A clarion call to combat climate change”, Feb. 14). In every country, resolutions that speak against racial injustice, economic inequalities and encourage sustainable ways of living are called ridiculous. This is because governments largely serve the interests of corporates.Sukumaran C.V.,PalakkadResponse to a responseContrary to what Subramanian Swamy argues (“There is nothing to unfetter”, Feb. 12) in response to my article, “Ayodhya and the challenge to equality” (Feb. 7) , secularism is deeply relevant to the argument over Ayodhya. Even if the term was introduced as an afterthought in the Constitution, secularism as a principle was inherent in Constituent Assembly debates on religious freedom, equality and the state.Equality demands minimally that the state should not take sides in a dispute between religious groups in secular matters such as land ownership. The Supreme Court decision of September 27, 2018 pertains to the acquisition of the land surrounding the site where the Babri Masjid stood, not its final disposition.The Lucknow Bench judgment of 2010 is by no means the final word. In staying the judgment, theSupreme Court observed that its partition decree was rather “strange” in that none of the parties hadasked for this manner of settlement. While the matter remains under appeal, the Supreme Court’s 2002 injunction against a final disposition of the land remains in effect.Finally, neither the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), nor the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas has any apparent standing in the matter. The dispute originated over building rights on the Ram Chabutra, part of the patrimony of the Nirmohi Akhara, which has repudiated the claims of the VHP and its affiliates.Sukumar Muralidharan,Sonipat"

In a freewheeling chat, ace actor-director Aparna Sen talks about the importance of creative freedom, the subtext in her narratives, and how the actor and director in her inform each other
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Like her films, Aparna Sen has a lot to say. Like her films, it is seldom on the surface; it is only when you process it that you get the essence. The celebrated actor-director was in Delhi recently to participate in an international symposium on ‘Creativity and Freedom’, organised by the Kolkata-based CIMA Gallery, Ashoka University and India International Centre. As a film writer, one is always keen to know what was playing on the director’s mind when she shaped certain characters. For Aparna, one has a long list. From trivial details like why did she name the photographer in “Paroma” as Rahul Rai? Did the fact that Aparna was herself photographed by a celebrated photographer for Life magazine play on her mind when she was writing the Rakhee-starrer? Aparna says, “no”, with a smile. She reveals that she met Raghu Rai much later though she was aware of his work. During the course of the interview, she admits that some things that exist in the subconscious mind do slip into the narrative. Perhaps, it addresses the more complex questions like the bond between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law in her “Paromitar Ek Din” (House of Memories) or giving a woman agency in a communal riot-like situation in “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”.Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the theme: ‘Creativity and Freedom’?Well, not only cinema but in every sphere! I believe this is the raging topic of the day because your creative freedom is being suppressed in so many areas. At the drop of a hat, people have begun to take offence. You can’t write, paint, make films without worrying about some faction or other whose ‘sentiments’ will be hurt! If you critique the state of affairs in your country in any way, you are branded an anti-national. Freedom of expression, which is a fundamental democratic right granted to us by our constitution, is under threat today.Many different groups of people have become more sensitive than they used to be. They are well within their rights to object to something a filmmaker may have said, but they often indulge in rioting or vandalising cinema halls or forcibly stopping entry into theatres. The various state governments, which should be dealing with such law and order problems, put a stay on the release of the film. For a creative person, the atmosphere is stifling!Did you ever face censorship?During ‘Mr. and Mrs. Iyer’, some dialogues were cut out in Mumbai and Pune if I remember correctly. The consensus was that what had been said about Muslims in the film would enrage them and create law and order problems. But you have to take into account the intent of the film. One person or a character saying something derogatory about a Muslim doesn’t mean that the filmmaker herself is against the community. In fact, she is trying to say that such comments should not be made. Unfortunately, a scene or a piece of dialogue in a film is taken out of context and judged.Your films had female characters at the centre of the narrative much before it became a trend. What were your concerns?Look, I make films about individuals. But I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act. But I don’t make a film as a platform for my politics. My real interest is the psychology of the individual. The individual herself is part of the system, part of many converging political ideologies. When I make a film about a woman, it is possible that my feminist politics surfaces somewhere but it is not with the intention of propagating feminism. I certainly am a feminist but, in my cinema, I don’t talk about any ‘isms’. I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How it has evolved over the years and if we could compare it with the present?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films. But most of them and many feminist filmmakers, in particular, were talking about women negotiating space for themselves in a male-dominated society. Women were mostly shown as persons trying to fulfil their own potential. A notable exception is ‘Mahanagar’ by Satyajit Ray. Here you find a very early feminist narrative where the man and the woman are treated as equal. At the end of the film, when both are without jobs, both stand looking out at the city stretched out before them, and the husband says, ‘In such a great metropolis, surely at least one of us will find a job?’ They are treated as equals by the filmmaker. Even if one of them finds a job, they can function as a family. It is one of the best feminist films I have ever seen.After that, it was more about women trying to realising their own potential and their fight to do so. Any talk about female desire or sexual choice was strictly taboo. That’s why in 1985, my second film ‘Paroma’ created such a furore! Many people wanted it taken out of theatres. They felt that women’s freedom didn’t mean licence for adultery! My point is, licence according to whom? The male-dominated patriarchal system where the moment a woman exercises her sexual choice, it is called a ‘licence?’Today, the situation is completely different. Women filmmakers are now very comfortable in their shoes. They are critiquing women even. They are comfortable making films about male characters, who are persecuted by other males or even females. Alankrita Shrivastava addressed the issue of female desire in ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’. Konkona Sen Sharma made a film (‘Death in the Gunj’) about a young man where the macho world around him bullies him so much that he commits suicide.There is a lot of subtext in your narratives; one could draw different meanings...‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ was about an Anglo-Indian school teacher and her dilemma about remaining in India. She chooses to remain. There is no jingoism here. She is not talking about her motherland,which she will not leave because she is patriotic. It was simply a personal decision of a woman who is unwilling to leave a place she has known all her life. She opts for the country that she was born and brought up in. In that sense, she is a true Indian. So, you can read the text that way too, if you wish. But I made it as a human being’s personal choice, which I find much more interesting. ‘Paroma’ was about a woman who exercised her personal choice and in the process came across the wrath of the family. Eventually, she realises who she is. She realises that she is a person in her own right. To that extent, it was about a woman discovering her own identity.In “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”, the female protagonist rises above the barriers of caste and religion for a bigger cause.She was going to Kolkata, and she didn’t know that the bus would be caught in a riot. Had she known, she would not have gone. I didn’t plan to make the characters as Hindu and Muslim to start with. I was just going to make a love story about two strangers who meet during a journey. They surfaced because of my deep involvement with secular politics. Meenakshi Iyer tells the rioters that she is the wife of her co-passenger, who is a Muslim, just to save his life. She herself had not known until that moment she would do so! In a physical journey, which is a wonderful metaphor for a journey into oneself, the woman discovers that humanity is more important to her than her caste or religion or gender identities. In spite of so much corruption and violence around us, I still have a deep and abiding faith in human goodness.In some of your films, we find women smoking? Isn’t it bad for both men and women?Of course, it is! But, people do smoke in real life you know! In any case, I haven't shown women smoking that much in my films. Some women do smoke, yes.For a long time, women smoking publicly became a kind of political statement. But, of course, it is bad for you. In ‘Paroma’, one of my characters smokes, but she is not the central character. In ‘Sati’, ‘Yugant’ or ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’, or ‘The Japanese Wife’,for instance, there are no such scenes.In ‘Sonata’, you resisted giving a name to the simmering desire between two women...There really was no ‘simmering desire’. There was just the hint of a grey area. It is left open. I like to leave such things open. Why should I always tell the audience what to think?How much do you invest in your characters?Hugely. In the process of fleshing them out in the script, they take on a life of their own. I had planned on having Violet Stoneham of ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ to go away to Australia in the end. That was then the reality of India in 1981. Anglo-Indians migrated all the time to England, or Australia, New Zealand or Canada. But I just couldn’t make her go! I get very to my characters. In ‘Yugant’, which many outside of Bengal haven’t seen, the dissolution of a marriage was used as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the earth. The couple there were called Deepak and Anusuya. When I was making the film, the shooting went on for a long time as we had no money. In between, I was in New Jersey with my husband and suddenly one night, I started crying. When he asked why, I said, I was missing them so much. He asked, “Who?” ‘Deepak and Anusuya,’ I said, ‘I haven't seen them for so long!’ I get emotionally involved with my characters. I care about how they think. They indicate to me how they should behave or what their dialogue should be.Do the actor and director reside in two different compartments in your body?They merge. The actor comes to the fore when I am writing. I write dialogue, which very few actors have difficulty in speaking. because when I am writing, the actor in me is silently acting it all out in her mind. And when I am directing actors, the actor in me is very helpful. I know exactly what problem the actor is facing. I understand the physical and motivational problems of the actors. If an actor asks me “Why am I saying this?” I can usually tell the actor how he or she can motivate himself/ herself.Is there ever a clash?Only when I am acting and directing at the same time. I had a problem in ‘Sonata’ as I had to keep running to the monitor after giving a shot.Like you, it seems Konkona also loves to explore the psychological space of charactersHer form is not too different, but hers is a new voice with a new perspective. She is another person.Is her style more technical?No, I don’t think it is technical. It is removed from the classical format. In the classical format, there is a beginning, a middle and an end. She opens with two people looking into the boot of a car, which is interesting because it is dramatic and intriguing with no formal 'introduction' to the characters as such.Why don't you make films in Hindi?I would love to make a film in Hindi. I don’t want to make it with stars though. I have tried that but it is a pain to pursue stars. In any case, markets are not as star-driven as they used to be. They are much more content driven now.What are you working on?I am making an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Ghare Bairey’(The Home and the World). I have called it ‘Ghaire Bairey Aaj’,because itis set against a contemporary backdrop. It is about how the world outside impacts relationships at home. I don’t want to talk more about it beforehand. I hope it will release in April."

Man injured in stone throwing; FIR registered; Yeddyurappa-led BJP delegation lands in town

The situation soon turned violent in which one man was injured.’In the audio clip, a man, purportedly Mr. Preetham Gowda, is heard commenting on the health of JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, and doubting survival of the party. Mr. Preetham Gowda has claimed that the voice is not his.Hassan Extension police have registered an FIR against eight people, including Hassan Zilla Panchayat member H.P. Swaroop and the former CMC president H.S. Anil Kumar, based on a complaint filed by Rahul Kini, who suffered an injury.Soon after the audio recording was released, angry JD(S) cadre gathered outside Mr. Preetam Gowda’s house and a BJP worker suffered injury when an alleged JD(S) worker flung a stone at the house, sparking counter protests by the BJP even in the Legislative Assembly.The BJP, under attack from the treasury benches over the audio clip, seized the opportunity to mount a counter-attack against the JD(S). A delegation led by BJP State president B.S. Yeddyurappa is in Hassan to take stock of the situation.“Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is responsible for not only the attack on the house of Mr. Preetam Gowda but also instigating it,” said Mr. Yeddyurappa. “We also plan to hold a public rally in protest against the goonda act by the JD(S),” he said.To meet GovernorIn Hassan, Mr. Yeddyurappa said, “JD(S) leaders are not ready to tolerate someone coming up in politics against them. We strongly condemn the incident. Tomorrow we will meet the Governor and bring to his notice that our MLAs have no safety under the JD(S)–Congress rule in the State,” he said.

A support forum that focusses on mental health among women, to have a meet-up every third Sunday ",,"AWARE India, a city-based voluntary organisation that advocates for women’s safety and gender equality, has started a support forum that focuses on mental health among women.Christened ‘Survivor Series’, the initiative is a series of peer-led support group meetings that bring together people from all walks of life to openly talk about mental health issues.“The support group is a safe space to share personal stories about living or coping with mental health issues. Through this support group, we aim to have a conservation about mental health without any judgement but with mutual respect, acceptance and healing,” says Janani Viswanathan of AWARE.On Sunday (February 17) AWARE is hosting a support meet for college-going women — ‘Girl! you can do mental health’ — to have a free-wheeling conversation about their everyday struggles and how that impacts their mental health.“For college-going girls, it is a balancing act between society, family, education and relationships, which could be quite stressful. Through the forum, we hope to discuss how not to get bogged down by societal pressures and other demands, and also approach the right people to seek help,” she adds.The three-hour long session will begin at 4 p.m. and will be moderated by trained volunteers of AWARE India and will include fun activities and interactive games and healing components such as yoga.“Survivors of mental health issues will share their stories which will be a source of support and inspiration for others struggling with issues of their own. Those who need professional intervention will be directed to the right persons,” says Janani.Every third Sunday, the support group will meet and talk about mental health. The venue will be informed to the registered participants only, so as to protect privacy.This is AWARE India’s fifth support meet since November last year.

Express solidarity with Hiren Gohain, Anand Teltumbde and students against ‘orchestrated witch-hunt’
",,"The Indian Association of Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies has expressed its dismay over the “continuing assault” on civic freedoms and Constitutional rights of writers, teachers, students, human rights activists and public intellectuals in the country.In a statement, the association expressed solidarity with Hiren Gohain, Anand Teltumbde and several Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students against the “orchestrated witch-hunt” being carried out for the cause of “raking up an electoral consensus against the spirit of scientific inquiry and free-thinking”.“The current political climate of fear and intimidation, fuelled and vindicated by the State and the ruling party, has simultaneously targeted entire communities through a range of religious-ethnic violence, as much as it has sought to silence conscientious voices that have spoken up against such onslaughts,” read the statement.The association said that “vacuous rhetorical constructions” such as “anti-national” and “urban naxal” — with no basis in fact or in principles of democratic governance — have been repeatedly manufactured as the grounds for punitive-legal action and media trials, through the invoking of outdated colonial codes like the sedition laws.The IACLALS stated that as a scholarly association, it believes in the need and power of a critical public sphere, as the only promise of a living democracy. “We condemn every attempt being made at gagging forms of dissent and enforcing regimes of censorship,” the association added."

Dealing with the thought police,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/dealing-with-the-thought-police/article26261460.ece,"
It is vitally important that the courts remain free of the discourse on ‘urban Naxals’ and ‘anti-nationals’ ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On February 5, an Additional Sessions Judge in Punjab sentenced three young men to life in prison. Arwinder Singh, Surjit Singh and Ranjit Singh were convicted under a little-known provision of the Indian Penal Code concerning “waging war against the government of India”.In what heinous manner had the three men waged war against the government, which justified a sentence of life imprisonment? A perusal of the 64-page-long judgment reveals the following. They did not commit any physical violence, and nobody was harmed in any way. They were not caught in possession of weapons. They were not overheard planning any specific terrorist attack, nor were they on their way to commit one when they were apprehended. What did happen was that the men were caught with literature supporting the cause of Khalistan, a few posters that did the same, and some Facebook posts (whose content we do not know) on the subject.With this being the sum total of what passed for “evidence” in the case, it is clear that the verdict of the Additional Sessions Judge is unsustainable, and will be reversed. It is important, however, for the higher courts to recognise not only that the judgment is fatally flawed but also that it represents a dangerous moment for the judiciary: this is not the first occasion in recent times when a court has abandoned constitutional values in favour of a crude nationalistic rhetoric that belongs more to the demagogue’s pulpit rather than to the courtroom. And in that context, the judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge marks the beginnings of a trend that, if left unchecked, can swiftly erode our most cherished liberties.Of speech and associationThe first —and most glaring — aspect of the judgment is its apparent disregard for the Constitution. At the heart of the Constitution’s fundamental rights chapter is Article 19, which guarantees, among other things, the freedom of speech and association. Of course, the state may impose “reasonable restrictions” upon these fundamental freedoms, in the interests of, for example, the security of the state.In a series of careful decisions over five decades, the Supreme Court has articulated the precise circumstances under which a restriction on the freedom of speech or association is “reasonable”. After the famous 2015 judgment inShreya Singhal, in which Section 66A of the Information Technology Act was struck down, the position of law has been clear: speech can be punished only if it amounts to direct incitement to violence. Everything short of that, including “advocacy” of any kind, is protected by the Constitution.Not only is this consistent with the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence, it also harks back to a venerable Indian tradition of civil liberties. In the early 1920s, Mahatma Gandhi famously wrote that the “freedom of association is truly respected when assemblies of people can discuss even revolutionary projects”, and noted that the state’s right to intervene was limited to situations involving actual outbreak of revolution. The logic is simple: in a pluralist democracy, no one set of ideas can set itself up as the universal truth, and enforce its position through coercion. Consequently, as the American judge, Louis Brandeis, memorably observed, “If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies... the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” The Indian Supreme Court’s “incitement to violence” standard responds to this basic insight about civil liberties in a democracy.Nor is the test diluted just because the issue at stake may involve national security. In three judgments in 2011 — Raneef, Indra Das, and Arup Bhuyan — the Supreme Court made it very clear that the incitement test applied squarely to the provisions of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), India’s signature anti-terrorist legislation. In particular, the court cautioned that vaguely-worded provisions of these statutes would have to be read narrowly and precisely, and in accordance with the Constitution. So, for example, “membership” of a banned organisation — a punishable offence both under the TADA and the UAPA — was to be understood as being limited to “active membership”, i.e. incitement to violence. In particular, in Raneef, mere possession of revolutionary literature was categorically held to be insufficient to sustain a conviction, something that was blithely ignored by the Additional Sessions Judge in his judgment of February 5.In fact, not only did the Additional Sessions Judge ignore Gandhi, Supreme Court precedent on free speech and association and Supreme Court precedent on the interpretation of anti-terror legislation, he also — staggeringly — managed to ignore categorical precedent on the issue of pro-Khalistani speech! In Balwant Singh v. State of Punjab (1995), the Supreme Court had set aside the sedition convictions of two men who had raised pro-Khalistan slogans outside a cinema hall in Punjab, in the immediate aftermath of Indira Gandhi’s assassination. Even a situation like that was deemed insufficient to meet the high “incitement” threshold, while here the Additional Sessions Judge managed to hold that Facebook posts amounted to “direct incitement”.Judicial objectivityThere is, however, a further point to consider. In the last few years, a discourse has arisen that seeks to paint a set of oppositional ideas as beyond the pale, and those who hold those ideas as being unworthy of civilised treatment. Two phrases have come to dominate this discourse: “urban Naxal” and “anti-national”.Neither “urban Naxal” nor “anti-national” is a term defined by law. These terms have nothing to do with incitement to violence or creating public disorder. But they are also boundlessly manipulable, and exploited by their users to vilify and demonise political opponents without ever making clear what exactly is the crime (if any) that has been committed. Their very elasticity makes them ideal weapons for shoot-and-scoot attacks, and for coded dog-whistles.It is one thing for these terms to be thrown around in a political dogfight. It is quite another when they begin to percolate into law-enforcement and legal discourse, where precision is crucial, because personal liberty is at stake. Indeed, it is vitally important that the courts, above all, remain free of this discourse, because it is the courts that are tasked with protecting the rights of precisely those individuals who are demonised and vilified by the ruling majority of the day.While the Additional Sessions Judge does not use either of these specific terms, his entire judgment, however, is of a piece with this governing philosophy, where conjecture, association, and innuendo take the place of rational analysis. In that context, his judgment is reminiscent of the Delhi High Court judgment that granted bail to Kanhaiya Kumar, while embarking upon a bizarre disquisition involving cancer and gangrene, and the police press-conference in the ongoing Bhima Koregaon case which did use the “urban Naxal” term.Case for careThere is little doubt that the life sentence of Arwinder Singh, Surjit Singh and Ranjit Singh cannot stand the test of law. However, when an appeals court considers the issue, it should take the opportunity to reiterate a hoary truth: a democracy does not jail people simply for reading books, painting posters, or posting on Facebook. And in adjudicating cases involving the life and personal liberties of citizens, courts must take special care to ensure that the temptation to get carried away and forget what the Constitution commands is held firmly in check. That reminder may come when the three men have already lost some years of their lives to prison — but it could not come soon enough.Gautam Bhatia is a Delhi-based lawyer"

In a post on Twitter, Home Minister Rajnath Singh blamed the “Pakistan-based, Pakistan-backed” JeM for the “dastardly” attack.Security personnel stand guard near the site of the IED blast in Pulwama's Lethpora area in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday, February 14, 2019.

The injured have been shifted to hospitals for treatment.”However, hospital sources said the toll was likely to rise “because the condition of eight injured jawans was critical.” The injured were shifted to the Army’s 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar, an official said.A security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that at about 3:15 p.m. a sport utility vehicle (SUV) laden with 300 to 350 kilograms of explosives rammed into a CRPF convoy of about 70 vehicles that was on the way to Srinagar from Jammu, as the highway had opened after a week-long closure due to snowfall.Also ReadPulwama attack: Suicide car bombing returns to the Valley after 18 years“One of the vehicles of the convoy was targeted,” said the CRPF’s Inspector-General (Operations) Zulfiqar Hassan. “It inflicted damage on vehicles as well as our men,” he added.About 2,500 personnel were travelling to the Valley at the time of the attack. Gunshots followed the blast, according to locals. The personnel under attack belonged to 92, 17 and 54 Battalions of the CRPF.Also ReadA timeline of major attacks on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir“Preliminary inputs suggest that it was a remote-controlled detonation with a group of militants overseeing the operation,” said a senior police officer, who declined to be identified.The explosion was so powerful that it was felt in Srinagar, about 30 km away away. Two vehicles, including the one carrying the bomber, were blown into smithereens. Eyewitnesses said only the charred skeletal frames of the vehicles hit by the blast were seen on the roadside, while several buses in the convoy sustained severe damage. The attack raises questions over security on the national highway, which is patrolled by the local police, CRPF and Army on a daily basis.Immediately after the attack, the JeM claimed responsibility and released a picture of its local operative who had carried out the attack. He was identified as Adil Ahmad Dar alias ‘Waqas Commando’, a resident of Pulwama’s Kakapora. According to the police, Dar joined the outfit in 2018 and was a Class 10 dropout.In 2001, 38 people were killed when a three-member JeM squad blew up a car outside J&K Assembly.The toll in Thursday’s attack exceeded the fatalities inflicted by militants in Uri, in 2016, when 19 Armymen were killed near the LoC.PM: sacrifices of our security personnel will not go in vainPrime Minister Narendra Moditermed the attack despicable and asserted that the sacrifices of security personnel would not go in vain.He also spoke withHome Minister Rajnath Singhand other top officials in the wake of the attack.“Attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama is despicable.

VC in-charge says he is yet to receive inquiry report on violence involving rival groups on campus

The police had also slapped cases against 40 others allegedly involved in the clash.The varsity had not even constituted a committee to probe the violence that occurred on the campus on February 5 involving members of the Students Federation of India, Kerala Students Union, and a group known as Malabaris. The police had registered cases against 50 students in connection with the incident. Prof. Sasidharan said the varsity security officer had been asked to furnish a report. “But we cannot act in haste without conducting a proper inquiry into who all are involved. Moreover, the police had already initiated action against those involved,” he said.Security threatTerming the open road access to the campus as a major security threat, Prof. Sasidharan said it had been helping anti-social elements get involved in nefarious activities inside the campus and go scot-free. “We have brought this issue to the notice of the government,” he said.Meanwhile, classes at the School of Engineering resumed on Wednesday. They were suspended following the February 5 clashes. The authorities had convened a meeting involving police officers, officials in charge of hostels, and representatives of student organisations to ensure peace on the campus."

Eight artists present a ringside view of displacement through their installations
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Celebrating its 10th anniversary, Hyderabad’s Iconart gallery asked eight artists to present their interpretation of displacement. ‘Displaced’ explores dimensions, from the physical migration to shift in identities, and is curated by the gallery’s founder Avani Rao Gandra.Over the years, Avani has interacted with art students who’ve moved to Hyderabad for career prospects and have stayed on. She observed how many of them got nostalgic about their hometowns.At a broader level, she observed how Hyderabad has been welcoming people from different corners of the country and the world, in recent times. The migration is driven by economic, political or environmental factors. “I’ve been wanting to explore the concept of displacement. The decisive moment was the ‘Do Din’ event in December 2018 that focussed on migration,” she says. In her installation ‘Exist – Exit’, Avani uses painting, coconuts and cotton fabric, for a metaphysical interpretation of predator-prey syndrome, the sense of belonging to a land, and faith that binds it all.Ajit Kumar Mahato: The artist who hails from Bengal uses boats, some in tones of grey and others in vibrant hues. Titled ‘Nou’ in Bengali, the art work denotes both the ‘boat’ and time as ‘now’. He discusses journey and time of displacement, the struggles in a new city where he chased his dreams, and the colourful memories of his hometown.Arnab Narayan Biswas: This artist’s love for heritage made him look at the shift from the past to present, through the now desolated structure of Mahbub Mansion in Malakpet. Mesmerised by its architecture, the artist gives us a window into its glorious past.Debosmita Samanta: Her interactive installation ‘Connecting the Fragmented Journey’ has assorted images and words. She encourages visitors to mix up the images and words. She reflects on a woman’s journey from one city to another and what it takes to tide over uncertainties and embrace life and responsibilities.Pavan Kumar D: In ‘Wish’, Pavan Kumar writes a poem on a bubble wrap paper, satirically denoting the urban bubble, and underlines his displacement triggered by the need for freedom.Sayoni Laha: ‘Stifle’ is her way of celebrating the right to live in a free space. Drawing our attention to gender anomaly, she doesn’t want to remain constrained in a society filled with violence.Sonali Laha: ‘Trespassers are prohibited’ stems from a personal displacement, as a now-parched land has nothing to offer and the movement happens in the hope of greener pastures, a newer land to herself where nothing can destroy it.Sweta Chandra: ‘Going to Town’ focuses on movement from the rural to the urban for economic reasons. She uses mirrors to reflect on life in both scenarios and the cost of displacement.‘Displaced’ is on view till February 28 at Iconart, Road no.12, Banjara Hills."

Vinod said making arrangements for the clinic to provide legal aid once in two weeks would be very beneficial.Snehitha counsellor Anitha Kumari S. said the domestic violence cases coming to Snehitha were of varied nature. While some cases could be resolved with mediation and a few counselling sessions, there were others in which legal help had to be sought.These included cases pertaining to domestic violence under the influence of liquor or drugs or those involving property.Calling Bell projectIt was decided to seek police aid for the Snehitha Calling Bell project that caters to senior citizens living alone.Government care homes could not accommodate any more as many people, who had families, had been abandoned there.It was proposed to ensure that families took up the maintenance of such people so that those who were destitute could be put up in such homes.It was also proposed that Snehitha help desks be set up at police stations that seek the facility to provide counselling in cases of extreme stress or requiring immediate intervention.Gender sensitisation classes were also proposed for all government staff. It was decided to start the initiative with a class for the Collectorate staff.Ms. Anitha Kumari cited the example of Snehitha’s gender sensitisation classes for anganwadi workers."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Anti-Semitic offences rose almost 10% in Germany in 2018, and violent attacks were up more than 60%, crime statistics showed on Wednesday.Police recorded 1,646 offences motivated by hatred against Jews, said a government answer to a request by far-left Die Linke party lawmaker Petra Pau.Among these were 62 violent offences that left 43 people injured, up from 37 physical attacks the previous year.Germany, like other western countries, has watched with alarm as anti-Semitic and other racist hate speech and violence have increased in recent years as the political climate has coarsened and grown more polarised.A mass influx of mostly Muslim refugees and migrants to Germany from 2015 drove the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which since late 2017 is the biggest opposition group in parliament.Leading AfD members, aside from railing against Islam and multiculturalism, have also made comments that play down the Holocaust.Party co-leader Alexander Gauland described Nazi Germany's industrial-scale murder of Jews and other minorities as a mere ""speck of bird poo in over 1,000 years of successful German history"".Another leading AfD politician, Bjoern Hoecke, has criticised the sprawling Holocaust memorial in Berlin as a ""monument of shame"".The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, and other Jewish community leaders have accused the AfD of fomenting hate against refugees, Muslims and Jews.Belt attack, Holocaust denialAt the same time, Germany has also witnessed a rise in anti-Semitic attacks committed by migrants from Arab states.In one prominent case last year a 19-year-old Syrian man was convicted for assault after lashing out with his belt at an Israeli man wearing a Jewish kippa skullcap while shouting ""yahudi"", Jew in Arabic.A video of the street assault, filmed by the victim on his smartphone, had sparked widespread public revulsion as it spread on social media, and triggered street rallies in solidarity with Jews.News of the belt attack coincided with another public outcry, over a rap duo who made light of Nazi death camp prisoners but went on to win the music industry's sales-based Echo award, which was subsequently axed.Days after the belt assault, some 2,000 people rallied at a ""Berlin Wears Kippa"" solidarity demonstration, matched by smaller events in several other German cities.Most anti-Semitic offences were however committed by far-right perpetrators, reported the Berlin dailyTagesspiegelin an article on the new crime statistics.Ms. Pau in her statement charged that ""we are seeing that militant right-wing extremists can openly call for the desecration of Jewish institutions and attacks against Jewish people"".A rising number of people and groups in the ""grey zone between conservatism and right-wing extremism are denying the Holocaust and engaging in anti-Semitic agitation,"" she said."

There is zero tolerance for such acts, according to DDCA president Rajat
",,"Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) president Rajat Sharma, on Wednesday, took a strict view of the assault on international cricketer Amit Bhandari and decided to ban Anuj Dedha, who allegedly led the attack at the St. Stephen’s College ground on Monday. Dedha will not be allowed to play in any format of cricket in Delhi.The incident took place when Bhandari, along with fellow-selectors Sukhvinder Singh and Mohan Chaturvedi, were engaged in picking the Delhi team for the forthcoming Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament.“This is unacceptable. We had to take this action to send a strong message to the cricket fraternity. There is zero tolerance for such violence and corruption and I have assured all the stakeholders connected with the game to have faith in DDCA,” said Rajat.The incident and the follow-up were discussed at the review committee. “I wanted to assure the selector and the support staff of all age groups not to fear anyone,” added Rajat. It was also brought to his notice that Bhandari had received threats a few days ago.“In future, selectors will have to inform us if they receive threats. Anyone receiving any threat can inform me personally. We have decided that no one, other than the player reporting for trials, would have access to the ground. We will also inform the police in advance of the venue where the trials would be held. Security of the players is paramount,” Rajat stressed.Trials in AprilThe DDCA is also planning to hold all trials in the month of April. “Normally they hold the trials in September but it would help everyone if we conduct the trials in April. The idea is to keep an eye on those picked so that they get ample opportunities before they are rejected,” noted Rajat.Delhi has had many incidents in the past where individuals have believed in muscle power to influence the selectors. Former Delhi captain Vinay Lamba was assaulted at the Ferozeshah Kotla by father of a candidate. Delhi opener Manu Nayyar too had quit as selector following threats and had opted to become a match referee.On another occasion, former India all-rounder Madan Lal and chief coach of the Delhi team, along with assistant coach Maninder Singh Jaggi, were threatened by a group of goons at the Kotla for rejecting a player. When the said player was picked by the selectors, the then DDCA president Arun Jaitley had sacked them all.“The selectors have paid the price for being honest. They now have the support of the entire DDCA,” assured Rajat."

‘Writing is an extremely political act’,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/writing-is-an-extremely-political-act/article26255292.ece,"
... but that’s no reason to brutally suppress alternative views, says poet-activist Salma
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Of late, dissent has become a trigger for violence against writers and intellectuals in India. For Salma, the Tamil poet-activist who was honoured with the Mahakavi Kanhaiyyalal Sethia Award for Poetry at the recently-concluded Jaipur Literature Festival, this isn’t a sign of a healthy democracy.“Thinkers are being called ‘urban Naxalites’ and treated like terrorists,” she says over a phone interview withMetroPlus. “It is the duty of writers to comment on contemporary society through their work; that’s how we change and adapt to the times. But to disallow any kind of alternative view, is not right,” she adds.Against all oddsSpeaking up for the marginalised has been a constant for Salma. Whether breaking free of the social constraints imposed by her orthodox Tamil Muslim family or highlighting domestic abuse, the poet has never held back on articulating her thoughts through the prism of feminine experience.Her own story, set in her hometown of Thuvarankurichi (66 kilometres from Tiruchi), of being denied education from the age of 13, and being married off at 19; being a voracious reader and closet writer whose talent was discovered against all odds, is awe-inspiring.Salma is anom de plumethat Rajathi Rokkiah, born in 1968, adopted from a character featured in a novel by Khalil Gibran. Considered controversial at first for expressing ‘shocking’ sentiments in her poetry, Salma faced obscenity charges and violent threats (along with three other women poets), in 2003.Her novelIrandaam Jamattin Kathai(The Hour Past Midnight), a sensitive portrayal of Tamil Muslim family life, was long-listed for the Man Asia Booker Prize in 2004. She has also penned two collections of poetry –Oru Maalaiyum Innoru Maalaiyum(An Evening and Another Evening) in 2000 andPachchai Devathai(Green Angel) in 2003.The life of the 51-year-old alternates between literature and social activism.As the founder of Chennai-based NGO Your Hope is Remaining, Salma has been working for gender equality especially among rural women since 2010, besides handling an active career in State politics that began after she won the Ponnampatti Panchayat elections in 2001.She also served as the Chairperson of the Tamil Nadu Social Welfare Board, and was instrumental in establishing several landmark schemes for the transgender community in the State. Currently the State deputy secretary of the DMK’s Women’s Wing, she has three more books – two novels and a poetry anthology – in the pipeline.Gender parityWhen asked about the impact of the MeToo movement on gender relations in the workplace, Salma says that women have long been denied the respect due to them. “Women’s status has changed little since when I first started highlighting domestic abuse through the Social Welfare Board. Society is not ready to treat us on a par with men, even though we have far more opportunities to work these days. I’m glad though, that the MeToo movement has helped victims to speak up about workplace harassment,” she says.It is more pertinent to teach children about gender parity early in life, feels Salma. “If parents don’t treat their offspring equally then children will never learn how to respect themselves or the opposite sex as individuals,” she says.Political penDividing her days between Chennai and Thuvarankurichi, where her family resides, besides travelling widely for literary engagements, Salma is a busy person. “Everyone expects a married woman to be at home and look after her family. But this is just a myth. A family is the joint responsibility of both husband and wife. We have brought up our two sons to be independent, and my husband realises that this works best for us,” she says.With an unusual way of expressing her thoughts, Salma’s writing style is modern and incisive. “Writers can rise above politics, but writing in itself is an extremely political act,” she says. “Since any poem or story I write is based on what is happening in society today, writing automatically becomes a politically-charged thought and activity. Administration and writing are different modes of conveying political thought. This is also the reason why writers are feared by rulers.”"

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.“China, show us their videos if they are alive!” Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter. He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated 1 million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution.Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centers where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education. Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism.In a rare show of public criticism from a majority Muslim nation, Turkey on Saturday called China’s treatment of Uighurs “a great cause of shame for humanity.” Citing reports of Heyit’s death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the “concentration camps” and “systematic assimilation” to which Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang are subject.At a regular press briefing Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey’s statement “a very bad mistake.”The video shows Heyit in a gray sweater against a nondescript, gray wall. He states his name and gives the date as Feb. 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused.The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed.Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are unable to contact relatives still in Xinjiang . Fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive.The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media. On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings.If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

He described his group, the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), as “peaceful”.“We held numerous sit-ins and protests and continued to hope that Pakistan’s leaders would try to address our concerns. Instead, they responded with intimidation and violence,” he wrote. “After every major protest, police arrests and charges PTM activists and supporters with rioting, treason or terrorism,” he continued.He also accused the security establishment of ensuring that “almost nothing is reported about our movement in the mainstream Pakistani newspapers and television networks”.The piece was “removed for print by our publishing alliance in Pakistan.The New York Timesand its editorial staff had no role in its removal,” a note at the bottom of the empty-single column on the front page said.The paper is printed in Pakistan by the local English-languageExpress Tribune, which regularly censorsNYTarticles."

Though the criminal conspiracy charge against the two CPI(M) leaders is viewed as a fresh blow to the CPI(M), the party is apparently seeking to use the new development as grist to its political mill with a narrative of victimisation. “The supplementary chargesheet is the latest example of the misuse of the CBI for witchhunting political rivals,” said the CPI(M) district secretariat in a statement.‘Disclosures denied’It said the CBI framed criminal conspiracy charges against Mr. Jayarajan and Mr. Rajesh by using the disclosures of two IUML workers as witnesses who, it said, had already denied having overheard the alleged hatching of the murder conspiracy at the hospital at Taliparamba where the two leaders had been admitted following an alleged attack on them by IUML workers at Ariyil earlier on the day of murder. The Communist Party of India (CPI) leadership here, which usually refrains from taking partisan stand on issues relating to political violence in the district, is quick to come to the defence of Mr. Jayarajan and Mr. Rajesh with the same narrative.“There are several examples of the misuse of the CBI for witch-hunting political movements opposed to the Narendra Modi government,” the CPI district executive said in a statement.The IUML greeted the framing of the criminal conspiracy charge against the CPI(M) leaders as a major step in the legal battle launched by it and the family of the slain youth to put his ‘murderers’ behind bars. In a statement, party district president P. Kunhimuhammad and general secretary Abdul Kareem Cheleri said the chargesheet validated what the IUML said when Shukkoor had been murdered. The legal battle would continue till all those responsible for the murder were sent to jail, they added.It’s a major step in the legal battle launched by the party and family of the slain youth.IUML district unit"

Says Speaker's consent not required in Rajesh’s case
",,"Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Tuesday said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) did not require the prior consent of the Assembly Speaker to arrest legislator T.V. Rajesh, an accused in the murder of Abdul Shukkoor.P. Jayarajan, the party's high profile district secretary in Kannur, was another suspect in the case along with 33 others, most of them local CPI(M) activists.Mr. Chennithala told journalists that the arrest of the suspects ‘‘were imminent’’ and Mr. Rajesh had no special legal protection. The CBI required the Speaker's permission only if it planned to arrest the MLA from the Assembly or the hostel for legislators.Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislator and Deputy Leader of the Opposition M.K. Muneer said the indictment of the two top CPI(M) leaders for conspiracy and murder in the case that involved the elements of a show trial and public lynching could prompt the resurgence of political violence in north Kerala.‘‘The CPI(M) was sure to unleash violence to intimidate witnesses and prosecutors. The CBI should shift the trial from its special court in Thalassery to a more safe and neutral locality,’’ he said.Both leaders accused Speaker P. Sivaramakrishnan of blatant political partisanship for having denied the Opposition's motion to adjourn the House to discuss the arraignment of the MLA and the perilous legacy of tit-for-tat political violence in Kannur.Mr. Chennithala said 27 CPI(M) and BJP workers had lost their lives in mafia-style hit-and-run political murders in north Kerala since the LDF government came to power in 2016.They said the murder of Shukkoor was particularly cruel. Mr. Chennithala alleged that the CPI(M) leadership ordered the teenager's public trial and death on the suspicion that the youngster had stoned the car in which Mr. Jayarajan and Mr. Rajesh were travelling through the locality on February 20, 2012.‘‘It was a high profile act of terrorism meant to instil fear in their political rivals,’’ Mr. Chennithala said."

Movies shown at Jai Chandiram Memorial Second National Community Film Festival
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Mainput is a small village in Chhattisgarh. Many tribal children in the village are involved in grazing cows and buffaloes belonging to members of the upper castes in the village.Called Harwaris locally, the children are treated as bonded labour who earn between an incredibly low Rs. 4,500 to Rs. 6,000 per annum. That makes it less than Rs. 400 to Rs. 600 per month! These and other dark glimpses of forced labour have been highlighted in the documentaryTrading the childhood.“While I was playing on the roadside as the shops were yet to be opened to purchase clothes with the money lent by the landlord, I was delayed. My landlord saw me playing and forcibly took me home and ordered me to work after beating me black and blue,” recalled a child in the film.Of the 106 children in the village, more than half are out of school. Children featured in the film are as young as 13 years and they know they were working as bonded labour. In one case a boy was sent in the place of his brother who discontinued to work. “Usually parents take loans from the landlords and to clear them send their children to work at the farm or house of the former,” says Prantu Suga, a farmer of the village. He says the landlords cleverly offer loans to those who are addicted to drinking so the debt will never be cleared and they can hire the children cheaply. The 7.57-minute documentary was produced by adolescent community media producer Laxman Mudi who dropped out of school after class 9 due to family circumstances. “We are showing the documentary to parents and children as well creating awareness among them. There is a little change among the parents after this as they said they would not send their children as Harwaris. Even the landlords are accepting their guilt,” said Mr. Mudi. This was made under the initiative Sangwari Khabariya supported by UNICEF and Manav Sansadhan Sanskriti Vikas Parishad. Two other films exhibited in the festival were:Salt in my village— salt making at Matikhru village in Phek district of Nagaland — andLash par Samjautha— a documentary on violence against women. The Jai Chandiram Memorial Second National Community Film Festival was held at Krishi Vignana Kendra here on Tuesday organised by DDS Community Media Trust."

",,"Granting relief to Anand Teltumbde, accused in the Bhima-Koregaon violence, the Bombay High Court on Monday not only extended his protection from arrest till February 22, but also directed the Pune Police to release him on ₹1 lakh personal bond if they arrest him.A single-judge Bench of Justice N.W. Sambre was hearing a petition filed by Mr. Teltumbde seeking anticipatory bail in the case through senior counsel Mihir Desai. On February 5, the Pune Police had informed the Bench that it would not arrest Mr. Teltumbde till February 12 midnight. The court had directed additional public prosecutor Aruna Kamat Pai, appearing for the Pune Police, to give an undertaking as a precondition to secure time to file an affidavit opposing the petition.The affidavit contained the same reasons Ms. Kamat Pai had mentioned in the last hearing, that there is incriminating evidence against Mr. Teltumbde and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act under which he has been booked does not allow for anticipatory bail. She said that a Division Bench of the HC had dismissed the activist’s petition seeking to quash the FIR against him, and therefore this petition should be dismissed too.The court directed her to share a copy of the affidavit with Mr. Desai and extended Mr. Teltumbde’s protection from arrest till February 22. It directed him to appear before the Pune Police on February 14, and told them to release him on a ₹1 lakh personal bond if they arrest him. On February 1, a special court in Pune had quashed the anticipatory bail plea filed by him and observed, “the alleged offences against him were ‘serious’ in nature and that there were appeared to be ‘no mala fide’ exercise of power by the investigating agency to implicate.”At 3.30 a.m. on February 2, Mr. Teltumbde was arrested at the Mumbai airport by the Pune Police despite having interim protection from arrest from the Supreme Court till February 11."

The transfer of the Muzaffarpur shelter home trial to Delhi is a major step towards justice ",,"The Supreme Court’s order transferring the trial in theMuzaffarpur shelter home case from Bihar to a court in Delhiis a welcome intervention to ensure justice for the children who were sexually exploited. The Central Bureau of Investigation had argued that the trial would not be fair if it was held in Muzaffarpur. In shifting it to a court notified under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act at Saket in Delhi, the apex court has once again demonstrated its lack of confidence in the Bihar government. It had transferred the investigation from the State police to the CBI. Later, it asked the agency to take over the probe in respect of 16 other shelter homes for children, destitute women and senior citizens. These interventions had become necessary, given the apparent apathy of the authorities in Bihar even after horrific instances of physical and sexual exploitation came to light last year. The Bihar government asked the Tata Institute of Social Sciences to audit the short-stay and shelter homes, run by non-governmental organisations but funded by the government. Last year, TISS came up with a damning report on the unsafe conditions in which children were staying in many shelter homes. The Muzaffarpur home was among the worst: many girls reported physical and sexual violence. More than 30 girls below 17 have been sexually assaulted.However, the subsequent response of the State government has not inspired much confidence. Apart from some officials being suspended, and some of those involved arrested, the State government did not have much to show as stringent action. Its response came under adverse scrutiny. A Bench of the Supreme Court found that 11 FIRs mentioned only minor offences, that is, “the least serious” of the offences involved. In the Muzaffarpur case, the court took note of the clout of Brajesh Thakur, whose NGO ran the shelter home concerned. The girls in the shelter identified Chandrasekhar Verma, the husband of former Social Welfare Minister Manju Verma, as a frequent visitor. The Verma couple later surrendered to the authorities. It is disquieting and significant that the court had to order Thakur’s transfer to a prison in Patiala to prevent him from exerting his influence on the authorities in Bihar. The court is also separately monitoring the functioning of child care homes in Bihar. Meanwhile, it is high time that States bestowed sufficient attention to such institutions. A recent Central government committee report highlighted the shocking inadequacies in the facilities available at most child care institutions and homes.

It is time to stop raising generations on a diet of victimhood ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"T.E. Lawrence’sSeven Pillars of Wisdomis a great read but is it a credible record of the Arab uprising against the Ottomans? The Arab historian Aziz al-Azmeh was scathing in his denunciation of Lawrence, holding that his was a work of fiction. But that is not the way many others recalled it over the years.Except for those nursing an acute sense of victimhood, Shashi Tharoor’s engaging polemic,An Era of Darkness, is not a serious, objective work of historical scholarship. While the British rule of India had its rotten side, it had a redeeming one as well. As Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh had the courage to acknowledge this in his widely publicised July 2005 speech at Oxford University — all without one whit downplaying the harmful aspects of British rule. That is a balanced perspective.The best of our historians tie themselves in knots toeing a nationalistic line, however unintentional that might be. A widely acclaimed book,India’s Struggle for Independence, by Bipan Chandra and some of India’s best regarded historians, is a case in point. Partition is seen as the outcome of Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s intransigence and the Congress’s inability to carry the subcontinent’s Muslims along. The latter point is Bipan Chandra’s view too. But any historian claiming to be objective would also have highlighted Abul Kalam Azad’s objection to Partition on the grounds that it would reduce, intentionally perhaps, the Muslims from a politically powerful quarter of the population to a less significant and vulnerable minority in free India. Developments since then have proved him right.The mass killings and forced migration of millions caused by Partition was entirely foreseeable, especially in the light of the extreme violence that accompanied Jinnah’s ‘Direct Action Day,’ a year before. Then why couldn’t independence have been delayed to ensure a less cataclysmic separation? This is rarely discussed anywhere, and never in our schools, where most Indians have their last brush with history, reinforcing life-long prejudices.It is time we stopped raising generations on a diet of victimhood while at the same time hoping to make peace with those of our neighbours we feel most threatened by. With the evidence now available, we should accept that, far from being victims, we share historical responsibility for our difficult relations with Pakistan and our border dispute with China. As the largest country in the subcontinent, and its principal economic driver, India has a great stake in getting its history right, for lasting peace to follow.In his perceptive essay, ‘The Decline of Historical Thinking’ in a recent issue of theNew Yorker, Eric Alterman observed, “A nation whose citizens have no knowledge of history is asking to be led by quacks, charlatans and jingos.” How true of today’s India!The writer has taught public policy and contemporary history at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru"

Choreographer Meg Stuart’s most abstract work – Violet – a contemplation of the human condition will be performed this week in the city
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"My most enduring memory of watchingViolet,choreographed by the American-born, Brussels/ Berlin-based choreographer Meg Stuart,was an acute perception of the heat in the theatre, of the sweat dripping down the five dancers’ faces, pooling down the bony edges of their arms when they touched. It was nearly visceral, a stark counterpoint to the chilly winter evening that lurked outside the performance venue, leaving the body on edge, causing it to curl in on itself. Inside, the heat consumed the space. It’s this temperature of the piece that drives its movement and becomes a strong rubric. Performed by Stuart’s company, Damaged Goods,Violetcomes to Mumbai on February 13, the first stop in a four-city tour across India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.Movement is changeWhat is a work of performance ‘about’?Violetoffers no easy answers, in its treatment of movement as a “primary motor”. In an interview with the curator Hans Ulrich Obrist for theKulturstiftung des Bundesmagazine, Stuart described the dancers inVioletas “platonic bodies”. MakingVioletin the wake of the Arab Spring and the tsunami in Japan, Stuart recalled asking herself, “What causes change? At what moment is there a radical shift in thinking and how do we handle it?” The abstraction of the work was qualified by what was happening as it evolved. “Normally you have all the time in the world for abstraction, it is something cold and detached. You work with lines, forces, geometries, but here we were working with abstract movements under stress in a charged heated atmosphere. There was an urgency and a call. That is why it felt extremely political,” Stuart said to Obrist.Violetisperformed by five dancers, to live music by a single musician. Sometimes, it is cannibalistic, consuming itself as a movement is swallowed into escalating manifestations of itself. A dancer’s arms, bent at the elbows, inscribe blurry paths in space, and occasionally, circles. The movement grows; it becomes more expansive, speeding up at the same time, till the dancer’s arms desperately claw the still air, their violence surging through the rest of her body, knocking her off-balance in bolts of movement, until she falls to the floor. For another dancer, an extended arm is an opportunity for the body to be in conversation with a charged space. As the arm cuts through space, it sends her spinning. At other times, the energy held in the arm reverberates all the way down to the spine, leaving the dancer with a curved back. There are simultaneities in the dancers’ preoccupation with the anatomy and mechanics of the body – when all of them engage with the movement of the arms, for instance – but there is no easy synchronicity. The dancers are together, but also very alone, each dancer riveted by what the body offers, seemingly oblivious to the presence of the others.In the momentIn her interview with Obrist, Stuart touched on the ways in which the notion of ‘exhaustion’ sits in her work, as the feeling of being present, as a strategy of art making, a means of being accountable to the moments we inhabit. “You tell someone: look at this, now look at it again, and again ... no, this image is not finished yet. This intensity, this obsession, to over-stretch time, to force people to be hyper-present – that’s what I see as the responsibility of art right now.”It is this intensity, this constellation of fractured images and flashes of the body in motion, thatVioletleaves the audience with. Of mouths held open by breath, by exhaustion, of bodies tightly packed, flesh splayed by the weight of bone on muscle, of the soundscape eventually engulfing everything around it.Violetwill be performed on Wednesday, February 13, at 8 p.m. at Balgandharva Rangmandir, Bandra;[email protected]goethe.defor passes to the performance."

Congress and cow: on M.P. govt's use of NSA,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/congress-and-cow/article26231335.ece,"
The Madhya Pradesh government’s use of the NSA for cattle offences is out of line ",,"The detention offive people under the National Security Act in Madhya Pradeshlast week, all of them alleged to have committed offences related to cattle laws, amounts to gross misuse of a law meant solely to prevent activities that endanger the country’s security or public order. India has unfortunately become habituated to the abuse of preventive detention laws. In recent times, they have been wrongly invoked against political dissenters and vocal critics, with total disregard for constitutional freedoms. The latest instances point to a new form of misuse. This is possibly the first time that a law that provides for a maximum of one year in prison through an executive order without trial or bail is being used against those suspected of offences against cows. The implications are terrifying. It means that law-enforcers will stop at nothing to demonstrate ideological adherence to majoritarian beliefs. This poses a grave danger to the freedom of movement and vocation, as well as the dietary choices, of sections of society that do not share the majority community’s reverence for the cow. In the first case in Khandwa district, the police, who recovered a cow carcass, traced three men who had allegedly killed the animal. In the second case, authorities in Agar Malwa district claim there was some disturbance due to two men who were allegedly transporting cows. The ostensible reason to book them under the NSA is that they were likely to cause disruption of peace. This is too flimsy a ground to invoke so stringent a law, especially when there is no evidence of security or order being under grave threat.In its order last year directing a series of measures against mob violence and public lynching, of which those transporting cows were frequent victims, the Supreme Court had warned against the dangers of a socio-political framework based on disrespect for an inclusive social order, and wanted the state to take preventive and remedial measures. In its apparent eagerness to prevent incidents that may lead to a communal backlash, the Madhya Pradesh government is detaining potential victims to prevent them from indulging in provocative acts! In invoking the NSA in respect of minor offences, solely out of fear of aggressive protests by right-wing Hindu groups, the Congress regime in Madhya Pradesh is displaying utter cravenness. It is not clear why the police is not content with prosecuting them under laws that ban cow slaughter. There is some unease among Congress leaders over these actions of the party’s new government in the State. However, it is not enough for the party to voice mild disapproval of the Kamal Nath regime’s actions: its leadership has to denounce the gross misuse of the law to mollify cow vigilantes and the short-sighted aim of neutralising the BJP’s campaign that the Congress is against Hindu beliefs. The State government must revoke the detention."

DDCA calls for swift action against assailants
",,"The assault on Amit Bhandari has left the Delhi cricket fraternity in a state of shock.The former India seamer was thrashed by goons who wanted a particular player to be included in the team for the Mushtaq Ali tournament.According to Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) president Rajat Sharma, “Amit told me they were pressurising him to select a player who had failed on merit. They had threatened to kill Amit and had a revolver with them.Strict action“I have asked the police to take strictest possible action against those who tried to take the life of an honest selector who was just doing his job with sincerity.”Sharma said the DDCA would support Bhandari. “Since this year selections are being done strictly on merit with transparency, and selectors have resisted all pressures and monetary offers, the miscreants and manipulators are feeling frustrated. “The assault on the chief selector is the result of such frustration. I assure you that no one will be allowed to disrupt this process of bringing professionalism and transparency into DDCA functioning.”Former India opener Virender Sehwag reacted strongly. “The attack on Bhandari for not picking a player is a new low and I am hopeful that stringent action will be taken against the culprit and adequate measures be taken to avoid such incidents. DDCA should look to providing protection to its selectors.”Bishan Singh Bedi, a legend of the game, said, “Absolutely unpardonable. These hooligans must be brought to book to bring sanity in selection proceedings. No violence can be tolerated to push for selection no matter how deserving. DDCA wake up and act. The cricket fraternity demands a swift official stand.”A livid Madan Lal blamed the system of selection in Delhi for the incident. “Compromises and adjustments are made at every stage. It's not good for Delhi cricket. I can't recall anything close to this. In the past too selectors were approached for some selections. It is a wake up call to set the system right so that no one can just come and beat up selectors.“Such people should be debarred and I would like strong action in this case. Cricketers are not respected in Delhi. You can't provide protection always, but a clean system can send a strong message.”Kirti Azad, who has long advocated transparency at the DDCA, said, “It is really sad to learn that Amit has been seriously injured in the attack. As a former Delhi and India player, I denounce such a cowardly attack, and would expect DDCA to take a very tough stand against this well planned attack and pressurise Delhi Police to book the attackers including this boy, under serious sections of the IPC.“No compromise should be made with or on behalf of this boy or his fellow attackers.”In the past, Vinay Lamba was assaulted by a player at the DDCA. On another occasion, Arun Jaitley, then president of the DDCA, had sacked the entire selection committee for selecting a non-deserving player."
How doctors DE-STRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/how-doctors-de-stress/article26236147.ece,"
Doctors, whom we trust with our lives, are increasingly reporting emotional burnout, strained nerves and acute physical exhaustion due to long working hours and increasing patient load among other reasons.Bindu Shajan Perappadan talks to a few medical professionals about how they unwind, relax and maintain a healthy work-life balance
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On January 30, a senior radiologist of a government hospital here died by suicide. A release issued by the hospital a day later attributed the death to “pressure at workplace caused due to harassment by colleagues”.In 2017, a resident doctor at the same hospital ended his life after his shift. The deceased left behind a note stating: “Happiness is missing from my life... I am not satisfied”.Such cases are regularly being reported from hospitals across the city, and doctors cite long working hours as a major reason for increasing stress among medical professionals. Even though the Delhi Health Department, last year, had assured government doctors that a single shift would not exceed 12 hours, the regulation is being flouted everywhere, say doctors.“Hospitals forget that we are human beings who start mentally shutting down after many hours of work. Delhi government hospitals suffer from acute staff crunch at all levels. The patient load is increasing at phenomenal speed... The dispensaries and mohalla clinics are a welcome step but that has not eased the strain on staff and infrastructure in city hospitals. No doctor here works for less than 18 hours a day. That barely leaves us time to catch up on our sleep. For most of us, our re-creation is to sleep eight hours a day and maybe go for a meal with family and friends,” says a senior physician at Delhi’s largest government hospital.Several hospitals and medical colleges now offer free counselling and support group for doctors and medical students to cope with increasing strain. Most medical professionals have also realised the importance of ‘self-care’ and have found simple hobbies and activities that they carve time out for to relax and unwind.“Work hours usually depend on seniority, speciality, and type of healthcare set-up where one works. A resident doctor in a government hospital usually works an average of 100 hours per week, whereas a consultant in a private/corporate hospital works for 60 to 80 hours a week,” says Manoj K. Singhal, director, Nephrology and Kidney Transplant, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Vaishali.“Besides handling the medical conditions of the patients, most of the stress is in handling the anxiety and emotions of the family. Lately, there is add-on stress of increasing litigation and violence against healthcare professionals... Most of the time we have to sacrifice our health, social life and family life to attend to our duty,” says Dr. Singhal.“To relax, I listen to classical Hindi music and read books. I enjoy cooking for my family and do so whenever I get the time,” he adds.Richa Singh, senior consultant, IVF and Reproductive Medicine, Max Multi Speciality Centre, Panchsheel Park, says: “Being an IVF specialist is very challenging – physically because of long work hours; and mentally and emotionally because we are constantly stressed due to pressures of giving success to couples struggling with infertility... Despite what most people may think, failure hits us just as badly as anyone else.”Patients come to IVF specialists fully expecting that their infertility issues will be solved in the first try, says Dr. Singh, adding “To prepare a patient psychologically for the treatment, with all the aspects of success and failures, is the biggest challenge an IVF specialist faces routinely.”“Despite all our efforts, there are a few couples who fail to conceive... We extend our emotional support, care and counselling to these patients so that they succeed the next time... Amid all these successes and failures, we attend workshops and conferences to keep updated... There is hardly any time for yourself, but I do make time to listen to light music, or go on a short vacation. That is the way to stay energised,” says Dr. Singh.Senior Psycho-oncologist, Max Institute of Cancer Care, Hiba Siddiqui says a major challenge for most doctors is figuring out a way to deal with the emotional burden of giving care to patients.Emotional burden“A common question raised by healthcare professionals is: ‘How to manage the emotional burden of care?’ A regular workday requires me to be around cancer patients and their caregivers for about 8-10 hours a day. There is high demand for my attention, empathy and presence of mind. No two individuals have the same concerns and as a psycho-oncologist, one has to use subjective understanding to tackle complaints,” says Dr. Siddiqui.Speaking about what keeps her going, she says: “Self-care has to be priority.”“If the work gets overwhelming, I reach out to colleagues, peers or mentors for guidance and I delegate whenever I can. I make it a point to adopt a healthy lifestyle (exercise and eating healthy) plus there is nothing like talking to co-workers for support, sharing a joke with staff or finding happiness in small incidences can go a long way in coping with stress,” says Dr. Siddiqui.Senior Ortho-surgeon, Apollo Hospital, Yash Gulati, says his love for poetry and music is what sustains him. “It is important to have something you love and to indulge in it regularly to stay fresh and positive.”For Udgeath Dhir, director and head, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, cycling is a stress-buster. “Cycling is the best part of my day. During vacations I make sure that I cycle with my family,” he says.“My day starts at 5.30 a.m. when I receive a call from my department duty doctor updating me on the status of admitted patients. When I am sure that my patients are stable I go for cycling, which is one of the biggest relaxation exercise I do. Minimum 30 minutes is mandatory,” he says.Tapaswini Pradhan, senior consultant, Head and Neck Cancer, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, says that physical activities such as jogging, running, meditation and yoga for at least 30-40 minutes out in the open keeps her fresh.“Operating on patients may be stressful for some, but for me it is stress buster... for me, it is a form of meditation. My operating theatre always has good music playing,” she says.“Best thing in my life is playing sitar... it gives me immense pleasure and its calming notes are soul stirring,” she says.Rajendra Prasad, senior consultant, Spine Surgeon, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, says that a good workout helps him de-stress.“My day usually starts at 8 a.m. and ends at 6 p.m. I try to meditate on the way home, but what really relaxes me is my time at the gym. Exercise releases endorphins, which makes you feel good. So, all the stress goes away after doing cardio such as treadmill or cycling. While exercising I also listen to music,” says Dr. Prasad.Suicide prevention helpline: Sanjivini, Society for Mental Health, Telephone: 011-4076 9002, Monday-Saturday, 10 a.m.-7.30 p.m."

Protesters open fire, torch vehicles and clash with police
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Gujjar agitation in Rajasthan for 5% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions took a violent turn on Sunday, as the protesters opened fire, torched vehicles and hurled stones on the police force in Dholpur district, 270 km east of Jaipur. The police lobbed teargas shells to disperse the mob.Dholpur Superintendent of Police Ajay Singh said half-a-dozen policemen were injured in the clash, but the protesters did not succeed in their attempt to block National Highway-3 connecting Dholpur to Gwalior.Unidentified miscreants reportedly climbed the nearby houses on the sides of the highway and opened fire from country-made pistols.The traffic on the highway was cleared within an hour after the agitators gathered on the road and halted vehicular movement. Mr. Singh said the vehicles torched in Kotwali area included a police jeep, a car and a bus.Agitation spreadsThe agitation spread to other areas in the State on the third day of Gujjar Aarkshan Sangharsh Samiti’s blockade of Delhi-Mumbai railway tracks at Sawai Madhopur district’s Malarna village.The protesters also blocked the Karauli-Hindon and Bundi-Bhilwara roads and briefly disrupted traffic on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway.Trains divertedThe sit-in on the railway tracks which began on Friday evening has forced the West Central Railway to divert, cancel or partially terminate about 200 trains during the last two days.As many as 26 trains in the Kota division were cancelled till February 13.Shocking, says CMChief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who returned here from his two-day tour to New Delhi, told reporters that though the government was willing to hold talks with Gujjars, it was “shocking that the violence has occurred despite [Gujjar leader] Kirori Singh Bainsla’s call for a peaceful protest.”“It seems that some anti-social elements sneaked into the crowd of Gujjars in Dholpur and gave a violent turn to the agitation,” Mr. Gehlot said, while calling upon Col. Bainsla to lift the “illegal blockade” and come to the negotiating table.As thousands of protesters continued to occupy the railway tracks between Malarna and Meemod railway stations, over a one-km-long stretch, Col. Bainsla — who is leading the agitation — said Tourism Minister Vishvendra Singh had come to the protest site on Saturday “without any agenda.”“Our stand is very clear. We will get up from here only after getting 5% reservation,” he said.“We will remain on dharna. We do not want to talk to the government. We are waiting for it to give the order for 5% reservation,” Vijay Bainsla, son of Col. Bainsla, said."
Caught between two extremisms,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/caught-between-two-extremisms/article26231338.ece,"
Wahhabi influence and Hindu nationalism are responsible for the radicalisation of a small segment of Muslim youth ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"News reports about occasional acts of terrorism outside of Jammu and Kashmir, which for historical reasons forms a special case, attributed to young Indian Muslims have appeared intermittently in the press. In addition, several recent reports suggest that global jihadi organisations such as the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) have recruited a few Indian Muslim youth primarily by exploiting the latter’s local grievances to serve their own global goals.Many analysts, Indian and foreign, had assumed until recently that Indian Muslims were immune to extremist propaganda because of both the syncretic and moderate nature of Indian Islam and the democratic and secular character of the country which made them feel they were equal participants in the political process. Both these assumptions are now problematic, as several factors have been at work in the past three decades that challenge this conventional wisdom.Wahhabi influenceThe first is the increasing influence of Saudi Wahhabism and related forms of Salafism on Islam as practised in the Indian subcontinent. This is the result of several inter-related variables but the most important of these is the vast increase in employment opportunities in the energy-rich West Asian countries following the oil boom of the 1970s. This resulted in many Indians of all faiths temporarily locating to these countries in search of higher earnings. While a much larger number of Indians belonging to other religions moved to West Asia in search of lucrative jobs, both white and blue-collar, the religio-cultural impact of the encounter with the fundamentalist form of Islam followed in these countries, especially Saudi Arabia, on a section of Indian Muslim emigrants was qualitatively different.Several of these temporary migrants returned to India enamoured with the obscurantist ethos of these oil-rich countries. This fascination was publicly exhibited above all in the adoption by a section of Muslim women, often under patriarchal pressure, of an ultraconservative dress code, including the niqab, or full face covering, popular in Saudi Arabia and some other West Asian countries. This dress code is very different from the traditional concept of purdah (covering up or modesty) practised by conservative Muslim families in the Indian subcontinent.Protected by SufismBut this display of presumed orthodoxy constituted merely the tip of the iceberg. The impact of Wahhabi/Salafi Islam on the mindset of a segment of returnees, who also passed on their preferences to a much larger group of relatives and acquaintances already impressed by the former’s newly acquired prosperity, was more profound. Islamic beliefs and practices among some Indian Muslims began to approximate the harsh Wahhabi dogma, which stands in stark contrast to the indigenous version of Islam in India. The vast majority of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent belong to the Hanafi sect based on the most liberal school of Islamic jurisprudence.Moreover, traditionally Indian Islam has been greatly influenced by Sufi teachings and is, therefore, tolerant and accepting of religious diversity. Visitors to major Sufi shrines, such as those of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer and Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi, where people of all confessions come to pray and seek blessings, can testify to the syncretic spirit of Indian Islam. Consequently, it harbours natural defences against extremism in belief and practice. The ideological infiltration of Wahhabism/Salafism has eroded some of these defences and made a section of Muslims more insular and, therefore, open to extremist ideas.Equally important, the spectacular rise of Hindutva or Hindu nationalism from the 1990s has had a major psychological impact on a section of Muslim youth, prompting their estrangement from the national mainstream. Inter-religious riots in which Muslims suffered disproportionately had been common in India since Independence. In some cases the police killed Muslim youth in fake encounters. The Hashimpura massacre in Uttar Pradesh by members of the Provincial Armed Constabulary in 1987 was the most macabre example of such incidents.However, until the 1990s the vast majority of Indian Muslims treated such occurrences as aberrations and their belief in the secular and non-discriminatory character of the Indian state remained unshaken. The demolition in 1992 of the Babri mosque by a Hindu mob under the direction of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) luminaries and the riots that ensued, in which scores of Muslims lost their lives, shook the confidence of many Muslims in the secular character of the Indian state. What was most galling was the Central government’s apathy in the face of this brazen act of mob violence despite the fact that it had been forewarned. This event began the process of alienation among a section of Muslim youth from the Indian state.This feeling grew exponentially a decade later in 2002 with the massacre of about 1,000 Muslims in Gujarat under BJP rule to avenge the death of 59 kar sevaks who were burnt to death in a train at Godhra after an altercation with local Muslims. What added insult to injury was the inaction, or, as the Human Rights Watch report on the bloodbath put it, the refusal of the state machinery to protect Muslim citizens.More recently, the disenchantment caused by these earlier events has been reinforced by the lynching of several Muslims in northern and central India on the pretext that they were taking cows for slaughter or eating beef. The lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri, in western Uttar Pradesh, in 2015 on suspicion that he had stored beef in his house was the most chilling example of such incidents. It was followed by additional acts of mob violence carried out with relative impunity by the so-called gau rakshak (cow protector) vigilantes. Such incidents have led to a widespread feeling among Indian Muslims that the state, instead of providing security to them, now colludes with those determined to intimidate them into submission. This series of actions and reactions makes it evident that the growth of Hindu nationalism has acted as a major stimulus for the radicalisation of a section of Muslim society in India and that the two phenomena feed off each other.Onus on governing elitesOpinion leaders and religious scholars from within the Muslim community have the primary duty to confront and defeat the malign Wahhabi-Salafi influence on Indian Muslims in order to preserve the liberal and syncretic nature of Indian Islam thus pre-empting the spread of extremist ideology among Muslim youth. However, the impact of the growth of Hindu nationalism on the Muslim psyche can be countered only by the policies and actions of the governing elites at the Centre and in the States. Only they can take concrete steps, such as quick and impartial action against those responsible for creating mayhem in the name of religion, to reassure Muslims that the state will not shirk its responsibility of providing them physical security and ensuring that they are treated with fairness and dignity. This will be the best antidote to the percolation of radical ideas among Muslim youth by removing their sense of alienation from the Indian state that in the long run can threaten the country’s security.Mohammed Ayoob is University Distinguished Professor Emeritus of International Relations, Michigan State University and Non-Resident Senior Fellow, Center for Global Policy, Washington DC"

The Madhya Pradesh government’s useof the NSA for cattle offences is out of line
",,"The detention of five people under the National Security Act in Madhya Pradesh last week, all of them alleged to have committed offences related to cattle laws, amounts to gross misuse of a law meant solely to prevent activities that endanger the country’s security or public order. India has unfortunately become habituated to the abuse of preventive detention laws. In recent times, they have been wrongly invoked against political dissenters and vocal critics, with total disregard for constitutional freedoms. The latest instances point to a new form of misuse. This is possibly the first time that a law that provides for a maximum of one year in prison through an executive order without trial or bail is being used against those suspected of offences against cows. The implications are terrifying. It means that law-enforcers will stop at nothing to demonstrate ideological adherence to majoritarian beliefs. This poses a grave danger to the freedom of movement and vocation, as well as the dietary choices, of sections of society that do not share the majority community’s reverence for the cow. In the first case in Khandwa district, the police, who recovered a cow carcass, traced three men who had allegedly killed the animal. In the second case, authorities in Agar Malwa district claim there was some disturbance due to two men who were allegedly transporting cows. The ostensible reason to book them under the NSA is that they were likely to cause disruption of peace. This is too flimsy a ground to invoke so stringent a law, especially when there is no evidence of security or order being under grave threat.In its order last year directing a series of measures against mob violence and public lynching, of which those transporting cows were frequent victims, the Supreme Court had warned against the dangers of a socio-political framework based on disrespect for an inclusive social order, and wanted the state to take preventive and remedial measures. In its apparent eagerness to prevent incidents that may lead to a communal backlash, the Madhya Pradesh government is detaining potential victims to prevent them from indulging in provocative acts! In invoking the NSA in respect of minor offences, solely out of fear of aggressive protests by right-wing Hindu groups, the Congress regime in Madhya Pradesh is displaying utter cravenness. It is not clear why the police is not content with prosecuting them under laws that ban cow slaughter. There is some unease among Congress leaders over these actions of the party’s new government in the State. However, it is not enough for the party to voice mild disapproval of the Kamal Nath regime’s actions: its leadership has to denounce the gross misuse of the law to mollify cow vigilantes and the short-sighted aim of neutralising the BJP’s campaign that the Congress is against Hindu beliefs. The State government must revoke the detention."

Says women blamed for the way they dress, behave in public
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Bangladesh-born author Taslima Nasrin has said that rape is an act of masculinity and power, and has little to do with sex.It is purely a weapon of subjugation and men have been using it since ages, she said, while speaking at a session on ‘Rape — A Weapon of Subjugation’ at the Knowledge Festival of Krithi 2019 here on Sunday.During Bangladesh’s freedom struggle in 1971, Pakistan army raped more than 200,000 Bangladeshi women. History was replete with similar incidents, she said. Everywhere, women were blamed for rape, about the way they dressed, behaved in public, etc.,. But rape was completely a man’s problem and they must be sensitised about this, Ms. Nasrin said. She was critical of governments in the Indian subcontinent for not declaring marital-rape as a crime. Even in prostitution, it was more violence and less sex.Sex objectMost men saw women only as a sex object, slave and child-bearing machine. Actually, it was not good for men to have slaves as their life partners, she said.“I am sure they will be happier if they have equal partners,” the writer said.Mandatory death penalty (for raping children) might not help reduce rapes. This would, on the contrary, reduce the number of people coming out to report the crime, she said."

Large posters of “No more Modi” and “Modi never again” came up across the State. The Left parties took out rallies wearing black badges and carried empty pots indicating that the PM’s promises were empty.The Prime Minister visited the State for the first time after the TDP pulled out of the NDA last year. Calling Mr. Modi’s visit a “black day” for the State and asking the cadre to protest against it, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday asked the TDP workers to hold Gandhian protests during the visit. In fact, giving the protocol the go-by, Mr. Naidu didn’t show up to receive the Prime Minister at the Gannavaram airport near here. Nor did his Cabinet colleagues receive Mr. Modi, who was on an official-cum-political visit, underlying that there was no love lost between the BJP and the TDP.The BJP leaders point out Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan received the PM when he visited the State. The onus was on the State government to follow the protocol. During a teleconference with the party leaders in the morning, the Chief Minister dubbed Mr. Modi ‘modati drohi’ (first betrayer) of the State. “Mr. Modi visited the State only to accuse me. He did not utter a word on the Central government assistance,” . The people are grilling them on the injustice done to AP,” Mr. Naidu said at a public meeting here.Recalling that he demanded the resignation of Mr. Modi when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat in view of the communal violence there, the Chief Minister alleged, “Mr. Modi bore a grudge against me for it.”As the general elections were fast approaching, Mr. Modi’s visit assumed political significance. The BJP even ridiculed that Mr. Naidu was afraid that truth and facts would come to light in the meeting. Hence, he asked the party cadres to stage protests, the BJP leaders said.Writes to ModiReacting strongly to certain portions of the Prime Minister’s speech, Mr. Naidu criticised the former.Later, he wrote to Mr. Modi, denouncing in strong terms the contents of Mr. Modi’s speech. He said no other Prime Minister in the past had faced such protests by people “wherever he went”.‘Protocol violation’He also found fault with the Prime Minister bypassing protocol of consulting the Chief Minister of the State he was visiting and said even his name was also not included in the invitation card.Five crore people of the State had watched how he had visited the state only to criticise the government, without even mentioning about the Andhra Pradesh Regorganisation Act and the promises given to the State. He said though the BJP leaders, with the Opposition party leader Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, made arrangements for his public meeting which drew a lukewarm response."

The KPCC leader said that ending politics of violence was the only pre-condition for striking a deal with the CPI(M) even in Kerala.Mr. Ramachandran accused the CPI(M) of fanning politics of communalism and violence by playing second fiddle to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “The CPI(M) is not ready to take on the BJP. It is afraid of the BJP,” he said.BJP responseMeanwhile, BJP State president P.S.

The officer in charge of the local Hanskhali police station and one of Mr. Biswas’ bodyguards have also been suspended.Mr. Biswas was shot from behind by armed gunmen near his house in the Phoolbari area of Nadia district in south Bengal when he was attending a Saraswati puja event.According to one eyewitness, three miscreants “shot at” Mr. Biswas and a country- made revolver was recovered from the area. At the time of the incident, the MLA was surrounded by several local Trinamool activists, the eyewitness said.Two persons, Sujit Mandal and Kartik Mandal, were taken into custody while three persons have been detained for interrogation, district police officials said.However, family members of the arrested men have denied their involvement in the incident. Wife of Kartik Mandal said he was not associated with the BJP; Sujit Mandal joined the BJP only recently, his mother said.Seeks CBI probeMukul Roy, former general secretary of the Trinamool and party’s ex-MP from Nadia, also denied any links with the killing.“The incident is unfortunate. My named is dragged into it to give it political colour. Mamata Banerjee is terrified after witnessing people’s participation in Prime Minister’s recent rallies and thus trying to entangle us in such cases. Biswas was a victim of Trinamool’s internal feud,” he said.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “Whenever any violence will take place, the Trinamool will blame the BJP completely suppressing the fact that they have huge internecine factional feud. They are engaged in various kinds of illegal trade like sand mining or soil mining and these killings are connected to the distribution of money.” He has demanded a CBI probe into the killing.However, several Trinamool leaders who attended Mr. Biswas’ last rites blamed the BJP. “Where is sand or soil mining in Nadia? Satyajit was killed as BJP realised that it is impossible for them to control the area if he is around, ” said Minister and Mayor of Kolkata Municipal Corporation Firhad Hakim. Trinamool secretary-general Partha Chatterjee echoed the allegations."

Assures shelter for homeless, records of rights for landless, jobs for youth
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Odisha unit of the BJP released a charter of promises on Saturday, assuring shelter for homeless, records of rights for landless and employment for youth.The charter called ‘Pratisruti Patra’ is like a printed declaration where people seeking home, land or jobs can fill up their personal details and submit the document at the party office. The forms are also being collected by the BJP workers and acknowledgement receipts are being issued to the applicants.The BJP while releasing the ‘Pratisruti Patra’ here announced that it would fulfil the promises upon being voted to power.“The Naveen Patnaik government during its 19 years of rule failed miserably. According to official statistics, 27.48 lakh families do not have roof over their head while 25 lakh landless people are yet to have records of rights in their name,” alleged Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister.“About 25.57 lakh houses were allotted to poor during the United Progressive Alliance regime [at the Centre]. Each dwelling unit measured 20 sq metre and financial assistance to the tune of Rs. 75,000 was being given. After the Narendra Modi government came to power, the number of dwelling units went up to 1.4 crore while the assistance was doubled,” said Mr. Pradhan.He said that the NDA government has promised that nobody would be left without roof, power, and LPG gas connection by 2022.“Mr. Patnaik enjoyed power thoroughly during 19 years of his rule, while Mr. Modi spent 55 months in service of the people,” said Mr. Pradhan. “In its 2014 manifesto, the BJD had promised housing for all, but everybody knows how many families have got roofs over their heads,” he said.Cong. declarationThis exercise of releasing a written charter of demands had been adopted by the State Congress too, which had issued guarantee cards to its supporters when party president Rahul Gandhi had visited Rourkela on February 6. The party had promised minimum basic income for poor and crop loan waiver. It had also assured financial assistance for higher education and marriage of girl child, water supplies in every household and steps to prevent violence against women."

Her husband was shot dead in front of her eyes in their home in Myanmar in 2016. Ms. Hosne, who has no surname, said her whole village was burnt down, and they escaped to Bangladesh for safety.“God knows, when I was in my mother’s womb was the last time I was at peace in Myanmar,” said Ms. Hosne, 25. “I saw the moment when they shot my husband. I was screaming a lot.” Ms. Hosne’s story is part of a larger tragedy that touched almost every Rohingya refugee. She narrated her struggle to a visitor of global fame: Angelina Jolie, the UNHCR special envoy. “I didn’t have any experience that made me feel that I’m a citizen. All the time, we only suffered discrimination; they treated us like cattle,” Ms. Hosne said.Ms. Jolie’s three-day visit that started on February 4 marked her first mission to Bangladesh. She had earlier met with displaced Rohingya people in Myanmar in 2015. Decades of “injustice” have driven nearly a million Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar and seek refuge in Bangladesh — the majority of them in the last 18 months, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Most of them live in just one area: Kutupalong, now the world’s largest refugee settlement. Ms. Jolie’s visit came just ahead of a new funding appeal, the 2019 Joint Response Plan, to be launched later this month by UNHCR, along with other humanitarian agencies. It seeks to raise more than $920 million to assist Rohingya refugees and affected local communities this year. Her presence renewed the global focus on the Rohingya refugees in a world where a new crisis upstages the old one.Decades of persecution“What is most tragic about this situation is that we cannot say we had no warning: it is the result of four decades of persecution and discrimination, which have gone unaddressed for far too long,” Ms. Jolie said in a statement on February 5. “It reminds us why there are over 68 million displaced people worldwide: because we do not succeed in acting collectively to prevent conflict, but find ourselves simply trying to manage its unmanageable human consequences.”Ms. Jolie said the world must not turn away from the Rohingya refugees. She called for continued support for those who have been displaced, until the Myanmar authorities show the genuine commitment needed to end a decades-long cycle of violence and displacement. For its part, Bangladesh sought global support to put pressure on Myanmar to take back its displaced nationals. Its two neighbours, India and China, have so far been taciturn on the issue.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on February 7 during his first official overseas visit, seeking support to expedite the repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar. Mr. Modi assured Mr. Momen of India’s cooperation, according to the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry. At a separate meeting, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said early repatriation of Rohingya is a priority.However, the prospects of repatriation do not cheer up the refugees. Ms. Hosne said she will only return if the people feel safe and protected. She started going to school in Myanmar at the age of seven, but left after a month due to repeated rape threats. Ms. Jolie heard Ms. Hosne’s story when she sat down in her basic hut in the refugee settlement. “Without proper justice, we can’t go back to Myanmar. We would rather die here,” said Ms. Hosne.Bangladesh has been pushing for repatriation of Rohingya to Myanmar. However, the prospects of going back bring little cheer to the stateless people, currently living in a refugee settlement"

Only the rule of law helps survive the age of extremes marked by polarisation, trolling and name-calling ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Polarisation today takes forms vastly different from what it did earlier. In a session titled ‘The Age of Extremes: No space for the middle ground,’ panellists discussed whether it is not only that no consensus appears possible in the public sphere to craft a centre that holds — but also that the kind of discourse that is playing out in the age of social media is so thick with name-calling that people take fright from nuancing their argument.Also ReadDynast or democrat? Unpacking the ‘mixed legacy’ of Indira GandhiFormer Union Minister, in the Rajiv Gandhi and V.P. Singh governments, Arif Mohammed Khan made a case for proportion instead of dismissing the situation today as irretrievable. He urged everyone to go back to history to consider the terrible violence that was visited upon different parts of the world. The media, he suggested, must resist from projecting every adverse development as if it’s the first time such a thing has happened. “The essential thing,” he argued, “is the rule of law. There is not a single problem that cannot be solved if we adhere to the application of the law and equality before the law.”Shekhar Gupta, founder and editor-in-chief ofThePrint, cautioned that the fear of being caught in the crossfire between two extremes could inhibit nuance and fact-based argumentation. Quoting journalist-writer Fareed Zakaria, he said it’s now seen that if you are arguing in nuances, you have already lost the argument. “Today,” he said, “if you are not in the trenches and want to check facts, you get caught in the crossfire”. He recommended that those keen to safeguard the middle ground and fact-based debate must develop a thick skin: “it’s a question of not choosing to enter any bunker.” But he added that we should not mistake neutrality for the middle ground.Ashwini Kumar, lawyer, Congress politician and a Minister in the Manmohan Singh government, however, contended that today public discourse has been severely “debased.” Saying that “moderation will always be the middle ground”, he pointed out that “it is the job of the leader to give direction.” Polarisation, he suggested, is not sustainable: “nature shuns extremes.”The discussion was moderated by Suhasini Haidar, Diplomatic Editor atThe Hindu."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The United States has presented a draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council calling for international aid deliveries and a presidential vote in Venezuela, triggering a Russian counter-proposal.While no date has yet been set for a vote on the American draft, and negotiations are ongoing, Russia is likely to use its veto power to block it as part of its support of Nicolas Maduro's regime, diplomats said.The text, a copy of which was obtained by AFP on Saturday, expresses “full support for the National Assembly as the only democratically elected institution in Venezuela.”The legislative body's chairman, Juan Guaido, has declared himself interim president of Venezuela, challenging Mr. Maduro's rule.The draft resolution stresses “deep concern with the violence and excessive use of force by Venezuelan security forces against unarmed, peaceful protesters.”It also “calls for the immediate start of a political process leading to free, fair and credible presidential elections, with international electoral observation, in line with Venezuela's constitution.”The text also requests that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres “utilize his good offices” to obtain such elections.It also “stresses the need to prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Venezuela and to facilitate access and delivery of assistance to all in need in the entirety of the territory of Venezuela.”On Friday, Moscow proposed an alternative resolution to the American one, diplomats said.It expresses “concern over the threats to use force against the territorial integrity and political independence of... Venezuela,” according to a draft seen by AFP.The draft also criticizes “attempts to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of... Venezuela.”Calling for a “peaceful” resolution of the stalemate in Venezuela, it “supports all initiatives aimed at reaching a political solution amongst Venezuelans to the current situation... through a genuine and inclusive process of national dialogue.”However, a diplomat told AFP that if put to a vote, the Russian text would fail to obtain the minimum of nine votes to pass without another veto-wielding country blocking it.Humanitarian aid sent by the United States recently arrived in the Colombian city of Cucuta at the border with Venezuela, but Maduro has refused to let in the shipments.Mr. Guaido said on Friday he was ready to take any necessary measures, including authorising a US military intervention, to force Mr. Maduro from power and alleviate the humanitarian crisis."

Says those who had cheated the poor in chit fund scams will have to account for every penny so looted
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday criticised West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her recent protest here, saying it was first time in the history of the country that a Chief Minister went on a sit-in in support of those who have duped millions of people.“Crores of people in the State and families of those who committed suicide after losing their savings are asking questions as to why are you [Ms. Banerjee] are scared of investigation in the chit fund scam. Why were you on dharna in support of those who compromised the investigation,” Mr. Modi asked.Ms. Banerjee staged the protest on February 3 when a group of CBI officers knocked on the doors of Kolkata police chief Rajeev Kumar, who had investigated the scam earlier. She withdrew it on February 5 after the Supreme Court passed an order restraining the agency from arresting Mr. Kumar.The Prime Minister, addressing a rally at Maynagudi in Jalpaigudi district of West Bengal, said that he wanted to assure every family who suffered in the scam that thechowkidaarwould not spare the people who had looted their savings. “Whether it is the one who has looted or who is providing protection to those who indulged in the loot, nobody will be spared. They can come in large numbers and sit on dharna. They can bring as many leaders as they can, but they will have to give an account of every penny taken away from the poor,” Mr. Modi said in the speech, which was streamed live on a number of social networking sites of the BJP.Fight against corruptionUsing the termMahamilawat(highly adulterated) to describe the Opposition parties once again, the Prime Minister said that he would not allow their attempts to protect brokers and middlemen involved in corruption to succeed.Citing the stand taken by the State unit of the Congress on opposing the Trinamool government, Mr. Modi took a jibe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi. “While leaders of the State Congress are saying there is lawlessness in West Bengal and the corrupt and goons are ruling the State, in Delhi the brother-in-law of Mr. Vadra is singing the tune ofDidi[Ms. Banerjeee],” Mr. Modi said.During his 40-minute speech, he spoke about the protests in Kolkata, and dubbed the Trinamool rule in West Bengal as “part two rule of the Communists” alleging that the party had brought the same culture of political violence.On the issue of triple talaq, he targeted the Congress and said that the party’s stand has cheated millions of Muslim women."
Forty years after the Iranian revolution,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/forty-years-after-the-iranian-revolution/article26218627.ece,"
A political change beckons which will not be easy but it is as certain as the overthrow of the Shah ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Friedrich Nietzsche prophesised with remarkable accuracy that the 20th century would be marked by great wars fought in the name of philosophical ideas. But what Nietzsche could not have anticipated was that towards the end of the 20th century there would be a revolution in the name of god, establishing a Shi’ite theocracy. The Iranian revolution of 1978-1979 (picture) was a momentous development in the modern history of Islam. And it had a huge impact on all movements across the globe, especially those that were using Islamic frames of reference for political activism.Some, like the French thinker Michel Foucault, enthusiastically declared the Iranian revolution as the spirit of a world without spirit. Foucault wrote: “One bears on Iran and its peculiar destiny. At the dawn of history, Persia invented the state and conferred its models on Islam. Its administrators staffed the caliphate. But from this same Islam, it derived a religion that gave to its people infinite resources to resist state power. In this will for an ‘Islamic government’, should one see a reconciliation, a contradiction, or the threshold of something new?” Following Foucault, we can say that from the very beginning, the Iranian Revolution remained a significant social and political transformation full of paradoxes and unpredictable twists.Clerical ruleThe Iranian revolution was surprising not because it caused a monarch to collapse, but because of the way in which people organised themselves and participated in massive demonstrations. Like many other revolutions, it united several groups, classes and parties who, despite different ideologies, were all against the old regime.Also, in the Iranian revolution as in the French and later the Russian revolutions, the coalition did not last very long and the Iranian clerics ended up having a leading role. But, the interesting point is that most non-clerics who were in the opposition against the Shah of Iran underestimated the probability of clerical rule, despite the presence of the clergy in all major political events in Iran since the Constitutional Revolution of 1906. Moreover, for too many observers inside and outside Iran today, events leading up to the revolution in 1979 took a mystifying and seemingly irrational course. But, unfortunately, those who try to explain hastily and emotionally the causes of the Iranian revolution and the Shah’s collapse generally only tend to focus on one or another specific issue such as the alleged corruption of the regime, the undemocratic ways of its rule, the effect of repression, or the economic gap between the rich and the poor.Social tensionsIf we consider the Iranian revolution not only as a political event but also as a psychological watershed, exactly as it was the case with the rise of Hitler to power in 1933 in Germany, we can understand why many Iranians believed back in 1978 that there was a messianic nature to Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership. In truth, Khomeini’s success in the Iranian revolution had certainly nothing to do with divine providence, but given that the Iranian population believed for centuries in the divine right of kings, it should have come as little surprise that the people were receptive to such ideas rather than having an acute sense of political pragmatism. Khomeini’s leadership, followed by the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran, therefore, can be understood in patrimonial terms, assisted by periodic doses of charisma. The immediate consequence of this socio-religious attitude was to institutionalise Khomeini’s role as the leader of the revolution.But there is also a political side to the story: Khomeini was not only popular among common Iranians for his uncompromising attitude to the Shah and his anti-imperialist and populist rhetoric since 1963, but also because he and his followers were fully ready and organised for the establishment of an Islamic regime in Iran. As a result, defying all the myths of secular modernisation and shattering all the political ideologies of modernity, the Islamic Republic became the first theocratic state in the modern world to have institutionalised the Shi’ite idea of Velayat-e-Faqih, or the “rule of the jurist”. However, the institutionalisation of Khomeini’s role as the “faqih” did not manage the implicit tensions which continue to exist between tradition and modernity.Despite total Islamisation and the reign of terror unleashed on political groups, there were advancements of Iranian civil society due to demographic changes, the rise of literacy and the magic fluidity of Iranian society. The insertion of cultural politics into the everyday lives of young Iranians in the name of Islamic purity created the reverse attitude and a sentiment of confrontation with the Islamic regime.Looking at Iran today, one can say that the ‘growing generational gap between the Islamic state and the Iranian youth, particularly young women, has never been wider. The question to ask would be: if the participants in the Iranian revolution wanted more than anything to be seen and to be heard, why, then, did the revolution degenerate into such violence and tyranny which still plague Iran? Why did people power collapse in on itself, engendering repression, stifling thought and action’?These questions remain unanswered, but if one thing is certain, it is that Iran is going towards a political change. This political change is not going to be an easy and a quick one, but it will happen with the same certainty that the revolution happened.Ramin Jahanbegloo is Director, Mahatma Gandhi Centre for Peace, Jindal Global University, Sonipat"

Rifat Masoodi’s cricketing idols are Shahid Afridi and Sachin Tendulkar
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Narwara is where we find ourselves — an aged neighbourhood in Srinagar’s old city, where devotees throng the shrine of Alam Sahib; also a place of unrest and violence where stone-pelting is not uncommon.Not far from the shrine, in a modest building that houses her factory, we encounter Rifat Masoodi, holding a 4.25-inch willow plank in her hand. She’s busy grading wood for the cricket bats she makes. “It’s the grains and softness of Kashmir willow that set our bats apart. The better the grains and the fewer the knots, the greater the chances of a player playing longer and better knocks on a field,” she says.Her cricketing idols are the game’s batting sensations — Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and India’s Sachin Tendulkar. And yet, bar one instance when she lifted a bat during a six-hour match played with cousins in a by-lane in Srinagar back in the 90s, Rifat, 42, has no memory of ever playing the game, and rarely watches it on TV. But, as fate would have it, she has come to be known as Kashmir’s ‘batwoman,’ a sobriquet earned after she became the State’s first female bat manufacturer.A graduate of Srinagar’s Vishwa Bharati College of Education, Rifat’s trajectory from ordinary housewife and mother of two until 2000 to expert bat-maker by 2019 tells a story of motivation and perseverance. “My father-in-law passed away in 2000. He owned a small bat factory. At home, there were discussions about closing it down. But I volunteered to run it from 2003, and my husband backed the idea. However, it was not easy,” she says.Rifat Masoodi at her workshop.
 
| Photo Credit:NISSAR AHMADHer frequent visits to the workshop, with its all-male staff and carpenters, were subject to neighbourly scrutiny. “Kashmir is a conservative society. It was not easy to venture into a male space and not attract caustic and sarcastic remarks. It did not deter me,” she says, adding that the same neighbours now visit her for inspiration and tips on entrepreneurship.No stopping herThe conflict in the Valley also threw a spanner in the works. In 2010, when a five-month-long cycle of shutdowns, clashes and curfews marred normal life, Narwara was among the worst-hit localities. However, it did not stop Rifat from meeting the deadlines on her orders. “My staff and I would meet every time there was a relaxation in the curfew, either early in the morning or late in the evening, to complete the orders. We did not disappoint our buyers,” she says.Over nine years, orders have multiplied fivefold from around 1,000 bats a year when she took over; numbers that hold even in the depths of winter. “Winters slow down a craftsman. However, I ask them to take their time but ensure that the quality is maintained,” says Rifat.Of late, orders and queries have been flooding in from all over the country. “Initially, I had to call up old buyers to pick up my bats. But now, orders are pouring in from across the country, especially from Maharashtra and Kerala. The buyers praise my workshop’s fine work and quality,” she says. She customises bats to suit preferences, with some players favouring a lighter weight and others heavy bats with broad faces.Lined up at the factory, the bats sport the label MAS (Masoodi Arts and Sports). The prices range from ₹450 to ₹3,500 per bat. “I have maintained three to four grades of bats,” says Rifat. Recently, a new fad has been keeping her busy: bats with smoke patterns. “We are working on these smoky bats to compete in the market,” she adds. With her home not far from the factory, Rifat shuttles between her dual roles as mother and manufacturer. “My daughter and mother-in-law need attention. I can handle it,” she says. Her husband, Showkat Ahmad Masoodi, a forest department employee and football coach, has acted as a catalyst for Rifat. “A woman can perform equally in all professions. I am a witness to it,” he says.Rifat, however, sounds less optimistic. When she looks around, she says, it seems as if women’s aspirations have died in Kashmir. But perhaps not in all fields. “The idea that a woman does not need to be dependent is picking up. More and more women have to venture out to live a comfortable and independent life. They will,” she says with a quiet confidence.[email protected]"

And yet, bar one instance when she lifted a bat during a six-hour match played with cousins in a by-lane in Srinagar back in the 90s, Rifat, 42, has no memory of ever playing the game, and rarely watches it on TV. But, as fate would have it, she has come to be known as Kashmir’s ‘batwoman,’ a sobriquet earned after she became the State’s first female bat manufacturer.A graduate of Srinagar’s Vishwa Bharati College of Education, Rifat’s trajectory from ordinary housewife and mother of two until 2000 to expert bat-maker by 2019 tells a story of motivation and perseverance. “My father-in-law passed away in 2000. He owned a small bat factory. At home, there were discussions about closing it down. But I volunteered to run it from 2003, and my husband backed the idea. However, it was not easy,” she says.Her frequent visits to the workshop, with its all-male staff and carpenters, were subject to neighbourly scrutiny. “Kashmir is a conservative society. It was not easy to venture into a male space and not attract caustic and sarcastic remarks. It did not deter me,” she says, adding that the same neighbours now visit her for inspiration and tips on entrepreneurship.No stopping herThe conflict in the Valley also threw a spanner in the works. In 2010, when a five-month-long cycle of shutdowns, clashes and curfews marred normal life, Narwara was among the worst-hit localities. However, it did not stop Rifat from meeting the deadlines on her orders. “My staff and I would meet every time there was a relaxation in the curfew, either early in the morning or late in the evening, to complete the orders. We did not disappoint our buyers,” she says.Over nine years, orders have multiplied fivefold from around 1,000 bats a year when she took over; numbers that hold even in the depths of winter. “Winters slow down a craftsman. However, I ask them to take their time but ensure that the quality is maintained,” says Rifat.Of late, orders and queries have been flooding in from all over the country. “Initially, I had to call up old buyers to pick up my bats. But now, orders are pouring in from across the country, especially from Maharashtra and Kerala. The buyers praise my workshop’s fine work and quality,” she says. She customises bats to suit preferences, with some players favouring a lighter weight and others heavy bats with broad faces.Smoky strokesLined up at the factory, the bats sport the label MAS (Masoodi Arts and Sports). The prices range from Rs. 450 to Rs. 3,500 per bat. “I have maintained three to four grades of bats,” says Rifat. Recently, a new fad has been keeping her busy: bats with smoke patterns. “We are working on these smoky bats to compete in the market,” she adds. With her home not far from the factory, Rifat shuttles between her dual roles as mother and manufacturer. “My daughter and mother-in-law need attention. I can handle it,” she says. Her husband, Showkat Ahmad Masoodi, a forest department employee and football coach, has acted as a catalyst for Rifat. “A woman can perform equally in all professions. I am a witness to it,” he says.Rifat, however, sounds less optimistic. When she looks around, she says, it seems as if women’s aspirations have died in Kashmir. But perhaps not in all fields. “The idea that a woman does not need to be dependent is picking up. More and more women have to venture out to live a comfortable and independent life. They will,” she says with a quiet confidence.It was not easy to venture into a male space and not attract caustic and sarcastic remarks.

Thai Princess is Thaksin’s PM choice,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thai-princess-is-thaksins-pm-choice/article26220511.ece,"
Her surprise entry ahead of the March 24 elections deals a heavy blow to the ruling junta’s head
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A Thai princess will run for Prime Minister in March elections in an unprecedented entry by a royal into front-line politics, pitting her against the chief of the ruling junta and redrawing the nation’s political landscape.Princess Ubolratana, 67, the older sister of Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn, was announced as a candidate for the Thai Raksa Chart party, steered by the divisive Shinawatra political clan. The Thai monarchy, a revered institution shielded from criticism by a tough defamation law, has traditionally been seen as above the political fray, although royals have intervened in moments of political crisis.Bridge between factionsPrincess Ubolratana’s nomination has electrified the build-up to a March 24 election which had seemed poised to return the junta and its proxies to power in some form. Her involvement gives a royal sheen to Thaksin Shinawatra’s political machine, which has won every election since 2001. And it also potentially builds a bridge between Mr. Shinawatra’s “Red” shirted supporters and the “Yellow” shirts who are arch-royalists. Deadly violence and disruption linked to the two groups has defined Thailand’s turbulent last decade.“Thank you for all the love and encouragement,” the Princess, who gave up her royal titles to marry a foreigner, said in a typically colourful Instagram post on Friday afternoon. “I want to clarify that I have relinquished the rank of nobility and am living as a commoner... I allowed Thai Raksa Chart Party to use my name for the nomination to the Prime Minister’s post.Shinawatra’s holdThe party falls under the tutelage of Mr. Shinawatra, a billionaire self-exiled former Premier, who stands at the heart of Thailand’s bitter political schism — loathed by the Army and Bangkok elite, yet adored by the rural poor for health, welfare and education schemes. He was toppled in a 2006 coup, while his sister Yingluck was booted from power in a 2014 military takeover and forced into exile to avoid a jail term.The Princess’s move deals a heavy blow to the aspirations of Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the junta head, who has spent nearly five years trying to recast the political system to limit the power of elected governments and prepare his own return as a civilian leader. In a day of high drama, Mr. Chan-O-Cha declared his candidacy for Premier, running for the Phalang Pracharat army party, moments after the Princess’s announcement.The military under Mr. Chan-O-Cha has cast itself as the protector of the monarchy. But Princess Ubolratana’s shock entrance into politics, aligned with the junta’s nemesis, undercuts those claims. She relinquished her royal titles after marrying the American Peter Jensen in 1972. But the couple divorced and she moved back to Thailand.Analysts said she is not technically covered by the kingdom’s royal defamation law — which carries heavy jail sentences — but given the culture of deference to royalty, she is unlikely to face the scrutiny given to most politicians."

Violence could also be psychological; 72% of Indian doctors have suffered physical, verbal abuse, says IMA
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Healthcare violence is a globally growing phenomenon, although the situation varies from country to country, say doctors. The Indian Medical Association and the World Medical Association came together in the city on Friday to discuss the issue of increasing violence against doctors.“Healthcare violence is occurring everywhere. The medical fraternity has been focussed on what they are doing to others and has not reflected much on what is happening to them,” said Dr. Otmar Kloiber, secretary general of WMA, speaking at the international conclave on zero tolerance on violence against doctors.Dr. Kloiber said the occurrence of violence is mainly related to armed conflicts like in Yemen, Syria, Gaza etc, paramilitary conflict, civil unrest and hybrid war like in Mexico, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Congo, Myanmar, Sudan and Philippines, and civil situations like in India, Turkey, Slovenia, China and USA. “There is no country in the world that is left untouched by civil situations,” he said.He described the classes of violence as physical, verbal, psychological as well as in the form of bullying. “The attacks are happening on clinics, inside clinics, medical transports and on health personnel on their way home,” he said, quoting 2017 data from Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition that pegged at least 701 attacks on hospitals, health workers, patients and ambulances in 23 countries in conflict around the world. More than 101 health workers and 293 patients and others are reported to have died as a result of these attacks.According to the IMA, nearly 72% of Indian doctors have suffered physical or verbal abuse in their career. “The situation has remained the same over several years as the implementation of the law has been an issue,” Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar, IMA past president, said. “The attacks are mostly a result of frustration of people against the system. If a CT scan machine is not functional in a public-run hospital, the doctors get abused. But what is the doctor’s role in this? It is the issue of the system,” Dr. Wankhedkar said.The healthcare industry has been witnessing increasing attacks on women staff, including doctors, he said. “The abuse is coming from within the system as well as from outside.” Reporting of incidents, in this context, becomes crucial, he said.IMA’s current president Dr. Santanu Sen said they have been urging all their members to notify the attacks. “However small or big the attack be, it has to be recorded. Cases of violence are often not taken seriously by the police, which needs to change,” he said. Doctors too have to change a lot in them, like make better eye contact, and use the right tone while talking. “Empathy is missing from our practice and we are trying to take some corrective steps,” he said."

Says those who had cheated the poor in chit fund scams will have to account for every penny so looted

Why were you on dharna in support of those who compromised the investigation,” Mr. Modi asked.Ms. Banerjee staged the protest on February 3 when a group of CBI officers knocked on the doors of Kolkata police chief Rajeev Kumar, who had investigated the scam earlier. She withdrew it on February 5 after the Supreme Court passed an order restraining the agency from arresting Mr. Kumar.The Prime Minister, addressing a rally at Maynagudi in Jalpaigudi district of West Bengal, said that he wanted to assure every family who suffered in the scam that thechowkidaarwould not spare the people who had looted their savings. “Whether it is the one who has looted or who is providing protection to those who indulged in the loot, nobody will be spared. They can come in large numbers and sit on dharna. They can bring as many leaders as they can, but they will have to give an account of every penny taken away from the poor,” Mr. Modi said in the speech, which was streamed live on a number of social networking sites of the BJP.Fight against corruptionUsing the termMahamilawat(highly adulterated) to describe the Opposition parties once again, the Prime Minister said that he would not allow their attempts to protect brokers and middlemen involved in corruption to succeed.Citing the stand taken by the State unit of the Congress on opposing the Trinamool government, Mr. Modi took a jibe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi. “While leaders of the State Congress are saying there is lawlessness in West Bengal and the corrupt and goons are ruling the State, in Delhi the brother-in-law of Mr. Vadra is singing the tune ofDidi[Ms. Banerjeee],” Mr. Modi said.During his 40-minute speech, he spoke about the protests in Kolkata, and dubbed the Trinamool rule in West Bengal as “part two rule of the Communists” alleging that the party had brought the same culture of political violence.On the issue of triple talaq, he targeted the Congress and said that the party’s stand has cheated millions of Muslim women."

Long-time allies Russia and China and several other countries continue to support Mr. Maduro.About a dozen human rights activists stood at the gated entrance to the Tienditas International Bridge on Colombia’s side, demanding Mr. Maduro allow the emergency aid to cross into Venezuela. They waved flags while Colombian police trucks carrying armed officers and other authorities drove by throughout the day.Luis Escobar, a Venezuelan who now lives in Colombia after fleeing his crisis-ridden nation, said his wife has advanced breast cancer and urged Mr. Maduro to accept the aid.In tears, he described how his wife was unable to get treatment in Venezuela and that by the time they were able to see a doctor in Colombia, her illness had significantly progressed.“I am here because, unfortunately, my wife is going to die,” Mr. Escobar said. “But today I am here for Venezuelans who are suffering the same as my wife. The world has to know about this.”Meanwhile, Venezuela’s communications minister, Jorge Rodriguez, appeared on state TV claiming Colombian intelligence, the CIA and exiled Venezuelan opposition lawmaker Julio Borges were behind a plot to overthrow Mr. Maduro.“A murderer like Borges must set aside hypocrisy,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “There’s no democracy, no humanitarian aid. What will he say, now that his own accomplices gave him away?”Mr. Rodriguez showed a videotape of what he said was a confession from retired national guard Col. Oswaldo Garcia Palomo as proof of the alleged plot. An outspoken Maduro critic, Palomo has openly spoken of amassing a military force in exile to remove the Venezuelan leader from power. He was arrested last month after he entered Venezuela clandestinely from Colombia.Also on Thursday, a coalition of European and Latin American nations called on Venezuela to hold free and transparent elections to peacefully resolve its crisis.A majority of 14 countries in the “International Contact Group” urged Venezuela to return to the rule of law and respect its constitutional institutions starting with the democratically elected National Assembly.Spain, Italy, Portugal were among European nations signing the declaration with Uruguay, Ecuador and Costa Rica. Mexico and Bolivia participated but didn’t sign.EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that the coalition does not intend to impose a solution but is focused on finding answers to avoid violence or foreign intervention in Venezuela.“We can have different points of view and readings about the causes of the crisis,” Ms. Mogherini earlier told the gathering in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo. “But we share the same objective, wishing to contribute to a politically peaceful and democratic solution.”Puerto Rico’s government, meanwhile, said 3,600 pounds (1,633 kg) worth of donated supplies are en route to Venezuela. Officials have said the aid is not part of the $20 million in aid pledged by the United States.Puerto Rico Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin said a plane carrying the supplies left the U.S. territory on Wednesday but has not yet delivered them.Venezuelan community leader Sonia Cosme said the supplies include medication to help treat diabetes, blood pressure, asthma and seizures.

Tough-talking: On Taliban reconciliation process,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tough-talking/article26196680.ece,"
India must ensure it’s not cut out of the resolution process with the Taliban
",,"The Taliban reconciliation process is moving at a faster pace than was anticipated. Talks facilitated by Russia in Moscow this week, with mainstream Afghan politicians sitting around the table with Taliban leaders, are similar in their approach to the recent U.S.-Taliban talks in Qatar, though the two are rival processes. The U.S. and Russia have accepted the idea that peace in Afghanistan is not possible without major concessions to the Taliban, including dialogue without insisting on a cessation of violence. In the duration of the Moscow conference alone, Taliban fighters killed 47 security forces personnel in attacks in Kunduz, Baghlan and Samangan provinces. The U.S. and Russia have, in separate processes, agreed to sidestep the Ashraf Ghani regime in Kabul, and accepted the Taliban’s condition that it will not negotiate with the elected Afghan government at this stage. And both the Russian and U.S. processes are dependent on cooperation from Pakistan, which retains its influence over the Taliban leadership. Clearly, the current talks with the Taliban are not within the “red lines” agreed to by all stakeholders in the past: they are not Afghan-led, owned or controlled, and the Taliban has not abjured violence, or sworn allegiance to the Afghan constitution before joining talks.However, despite the deep and obvious misgivings in New Delhi, it would be pointless to ignore or reject the outcomes of the talks, where some progress has been made. The U.S. has managed to bring senior Taliban leaders to the table, and is discussing the contours of its ultimate withdrawal from the Afghan war. The Taliban has unequivocally renounced ties with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, and committed to preventing Afghan soil from being used by foreign terrorists. For its part, Russia has hosted conferences where Taliban leaders sat down with members of the Afghan High Peace Council and senior Afghan politicians, including some contesting in this year’s presidential elections. While India’s principled position that it will not directly or publicly talk to the Taliban until it engages the Afghan government remains valid, it is necessary that India stays abreast of all negotiations and isn’t cut out of the resolution process. It is hoped that a robust channel is open between Indian intelligence agencies and all important groups in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, in order to ensure that Indian interests, development projects and citizens are kept secure. New Delhi must intensify its dialogue with regional and global stakeholders, and impress upon them that any dialogue with the Taliban must not come at the cost of the hard-fought victories of the Afghan people in the past two decades: on establishing constitutional democracy and the rule of law, and securing the rights of women and minorities."

Much as the duo will secure their property against such violations, Tarsh believes that confining elephants into protected zones or elephant corridors is not the solution to man-animal conflict, rather co-existence is.“The sparing versus sharing or the whole earth versus half the earth debate is currently raging in conservation. In the last three years in Gudalur I have seen elephants 600 times and heard of just 10 human–elephant run-ins. Reports are often highly exaggerated.

When the elephant project was flagged, four years ago, in collaboration with UK NGO Elephant Family, he came up with the idea of using Lantana to make the installations. He approached the tribes who until then were making furniture unimaginatively.

Activists urge people to speak out against government; intellectual intimidation higher now than Emergency, says Sainath
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Activists, writers and academics on Tuesday urged people to speak out against the government, pointing out that cases against Professor Anand Teltumbde were a part of the State’s crackdown on dissenting voices.The press conference was organised by Mumbai Rises to Save Democracy, a collective of 41 organisations fighting for civil rights. Journalists P. Sainath and Niranjan Takle and author Urmila Pawar condemned the State’s action against Mr. Teltumbde, a well known academic and faculty member at the Goa Institute of Management.Mr. Sainath said that though criminalising dissent did not start with the current government, it has been taken to another level in the last five years. “I am not surprised with what is happening to Mr. Teltumbde or Sudha Bharadwaj because they are among the most articulate intellectuals in the country,” he said. Intellectual intimidation by the present government was higher than what was experienced during the Emergency, he said.“The incident in Bhima-Koregaon was part of a conspiracy and instead of locking up those behind it, the authorities are arresting those who are protesting against it,” Ms. Pawar said. She focused on the plight of Dalits across the country, especially the youth, who continue to be harassed across universities. She said that Dalit youth and women will not keep quiet at institutional violence meted to them.Mr. Takle said no letters had ever been found during the investigations into the assassinations of Mahatma Gandhi or Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Mr. Teltumbde has been charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for allegedly being an ‘urban-Maoist’ and being part of a consipracy to assassinate the PM. “This is not a figment of the imagination. It is part of a design,” he said. The path that the present government is on is strikingly similar to the Nazi governmen. “We know the path the Nazis took, but the people need not take this path. Everyone needs to speak out. If we don’t then the next generation will be deprived of the freedom we have,” he said.Mr. Sainath highlighted the manner in which false cases were slapped on those who spoke out against State policies. There needs to be laws to ensure accountability where cases are deliberately framed against certain individuals, he said. During the Bhima-Koregaon violence over 600 cases were registered, but Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis later said that only the serious ones would be pursued. “It is a wonderfully honest admission that most of the cases were not serious,” Mr. Sainath said."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on Tuesday that the Centre should initiate legislative process to protect the freedom of places of worship.Mr. Tharoor, Member of Parliament from Thiruvananthapuram, raised the issue in the Lok Sabha during Zero Hour. He said only a law to undo the Supreme Court order on Sabarimala — allowing women of menstruating age to enter the temple — would pacify the protesters.“I urge the government to come up with a legislative action to ensure and protect the freedom of religious places and worship in principle with constitutional values because we need to clarify the application of essential religious practices,” he told the Lok Sabha.Vandalism, violenceWithout naming the BJP that has been at the forefront of the protests in Kerala, the Congress MP said protests of “genuine believers” had been hijacked for political gains. “Irresponsible parties have been trying to hijack protests by genuine believers in a bid to reap political dividends. They have been engaging in vandalism and violence, not only disrupting the law and order in the State, but also disturbing the sanctity of the holy abode of Lord Ayyappa,” he said.“This problem can only be solved either through a judicial process in the form of a review of the honourable Supreme Court’s judgment or through a legislative action by Parliament. It is hypocrisy to create violence and protests when you have the majority to pass a law,” Mr. Tharoor said.Though the Congress had welcomed the Supreme Court ruling as a landmark judgment, the party has changed its position in the past few weeks.Last month, at a public meeting with the Indian diaspora in Dubai, Congress president Rahul Gandhi too had changed his earlier position strongly supporting the top court’s position.“People should be allowed to decide on the issue,” he said."
Brazil education overhaul aims at ousting ‘Marxist ideology’,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brazil-education-overhaul-aims-at-ousting-marxist-ideology/article26192196.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"President Jair Bolsonaro is taking his anti-Leftist ideological war to Brazil’s classrooms and universities, causing angst among teachers and education officials who say the government wants to fight an enemy that doesn’t exist.Bolsonaro and top officials have announced plans to revise textbooks to excise references to feminism, homosexuality and violence against women, say the military will take over some public schools and frequently bash Paulo Freire, one of Brazil’s most famous educators, whose ideas had worldwide influence.“One of the goals to get Brazil out of the worst positions in international education rankings is to combat the Marxist rubbish that has spread in educational institutions,” Bolsonaro tweeted on the eve of his inauguration.While students may not yet find many differences as they return to school this month, changes are afoot.“We are still waiting to see how, in practice, all this is going to turn out,” said Nilton Brandao, president of one of Brazil’s largest teachers’ unions, PROIFES Federacao. “Right now, it does not make any sense.”For the government, the ideological battle begins with the removal of Freire’s legacy in schools, which Bolsonaro and other conservatives say turns students into “political militants.”Founder of critical pedagogyFreire, who died in 1997, was one of the founders of critical pedagogy. Conservatives contend Freire’s method encourages students to challenge traditional values such as family and the church. A socialist, Freire was briefly imprisoned during the 1964-1985 military dictatorship that Bolsonaro has repeatedly praised.On the campaign trail, Bolsonaro said he wanted to “enter the Education Ministry with a flamethrower to remove Paulo Freire.”Bolsonaro and his education minster appear to be looking for inspiration in philosophers like Olavo de Carvalho, a Brazilian who lives in the U.S. and is known for his anti-globalism and anti-socialist views.While Freire believed in the state’s mission to educate the Brazilian people, including poor rural farmers and the illiterate, de Carvalho advocates reducing the state’s role in education, favoring private or religious schools.“The government does not have to educate anyone; it is the society that has to educate itself,” de Carvalho said last year during a talk about education on his YouTube channel. He added that proposals “based on the idea that the federal government is the great educator I am going to fight to the death.”After Bolsonaro took office Jan. 1, the Education Ministry dismantled its diversity department and published a new set of guidelines for textbook publishers that eliminated references to topics such as violence against women and sexism.Receiving an outpouring of criticism, officials backtracked on the revised texts, saying the new guidelines had been written by the previous administration and published by mistake. Even so, Education Minister Ricardo Velez Rodriguez vowed in his inaugural speech to end the “aggressive promotion of the gender ideology.”Velez instead defended what he called traditional values, such as family, church, school and the nation, which he said were threatened by a “crazy globalist wave.”Bolsonaro has said he would review the content of Brazil’s national high school exam to rid it of any questions on gender or LGBT movements. He made the announcement in a YouTube video after seeing a question from last year’s exam on a “secret dialect used by gays and transvestites,” called Pajuba.The Pajuba dialect mixes Portuguese and West African languages and is mostly used in Afro-Brazilian religions but has also been adopted by the Brazilian LGBT community.“Don’t worry, there won’t be any more questions like this,” Bolsonaro said.After his inauguration, Velez told the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that his office will encourage municipalities interested in letting their schools be run by the military or the police.Brazil has 13 military-run schools, which are aimed at educating children of soldiers but also accept some students based on merit. The military is the most respected institution in the country and its schools have a better reputation than many public schools.The military is also sometimes called in to co-run public schools and bring back order.Last year, 39.5 million students attended a public school, while private institutions, which can cost several thousand dollars a month, served 9 million.Opponents say the selective admission process of military schools would end up being discriminatory in impoverished areas.In general, critics say the administration is focused on the wrong things.Claudia Costin, director of Brazil’s Center for Excellence and Innovation in Education Policies, a think tank based in Rio de Janeiro, said efforts should focus on improving training and salaries for teachers, making the entrance exam for teachers tougher and building a common syllabus for schools across the country.The government “complains about indoctrination at school,” Costin said. “But it is not with laws that you solve these things.”Brazil ranked 63rd out of the 72 countries and regions in the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment, conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.According to the group, Brazil has as one of the largest shares of adults without secondary education. Schools are overcrowded, teacher salaries and low and school buildings are often crumbling.More than 5.800 schools had no water supply in 2017, nearly 5.000 had no electricity and 8.400 had no sewage, according to government figures.Many Brazilians don’t appear convinced by Bolsonaro’s plans.In a poll published Jan. 8, 71 percent of those surveyed said politics should be discussed at school and 54 percent thought it was fine to discuss sexual education inside the classroom.The poll, however, indicated that the new administration’s conservative views played well with evangelicals, a powerful voter base for Bolsonaro during the campaign. Fifty-nine percent of evangelicals said they did not approve of sexual education being discussed at school.The Datafolha poll was based on 2,077 interviews carried out Dec. 18 and Dec. 19, with a margin of error of two percentage points.Caua dos Santos Borges, a 15-year-old public school student in Rio de Janeiro, said that in her experience teachers rarely spoke about politics in the classroom and gender had never felt like a core area of the curriculum.“Once, a student asked the teacher if he supported Bolsonaro, but the teacher didn’t respond and changed the subject,” dos Santos Borges said."

Students in B. Tech hostels on the campus were told to vacate the premises immediately. Tension began after students belonging to the SFI allegedly entered the Sahara hostel and attacked those affiliated to the KSU and another group known as ‘Malabaris’.The police said the incident was a follow-up of the clashes that broke out between the warring factions during a programme organised by fifth semester students last week.

Cracks in the framework,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/cracks-in-the-framework/article26187164.ece,"
With the systematic weakening of institutions, the government risks pushing all resistance to the streets ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Government of India has reportedly suppressed its own data on current employment, or rather job loss, in the country. It has, thereby, compromised the autonomy and the standing of the National Statistical Commission. This is the latest instalment in the rather sordid story of institutional decay in India, overseen by the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This is not to suggest that previous governments did not undermine institutions. The internal Emergency imposed on the country from 1975 to 1977 initiated the process. The government tried to tame bureaucrats as well as the highest court in the land. Postings and appointments were manipulated to suit the ruling dispensation. The BJP government has, however, earned the dubious distinction of sabotaging the autonomy of several political institutions in rapid succession.Necessary checksInstitutional decay occasions worry because it affects ordinary citizens in disastrous ways. All governments, even those which have been democratically elected, betray an inexorable will to power. Expectedly, expansion of government power violates constitutional rights to freedom, equality and justice. The only way citizens can be protected against any arbitrary and unlawful exercise of power is by limiting the power of government. Liberal democrats, always sceptical of state power, have tried to contain dramatic surges of power by charting out of constitutions and institutional design. Institutions, as the embodiment of formal and informal rules, assure citizens that the government exercises power according to some norms that enable as well as regulate state capacity.This makes for good political sense when we remember that most human activity is structured by systems of rules — take the intricate and rule-bound game of chess or cricket. Relationships, households, the economy, society, the games we play and do not play take place and develop within the framework of rules. Human beings are social, but we cannot be social unless we know what is expected of us, and what we should do or not do. Without rules that govern relationships — for example, the norm that friendship is based on trust— we will not know what is worthwhile and what is not, what is preferable and what should be avoided, and what is appropriate and what is expedient.The Canadian political philosopher Charles Taylor has argued in his famous work,Sources of the Self(1989), that institutions embody ‘strong evaluations’. We learn to discriminate between right and wrong, better and worse, and higher and lower. These evaluations are not judged subjectively by our own desires or impulses. Institutions, which stand independently of us, give us standards that allow us to evaluate. Following Taylor, we can rightly wonder why political power should be exercised, implemented and executed without rules. Assertions of political power adversely affect our interests and our projects. We should be in a position to judge when this power is exercised fairly or unfairly. Rules in a democracy assure us that justice is synonymous with fairness.Moreover, rules make our worlds predictable. We know what the boundaries of the freedom of expression are, we know that if the police arrests us tomorrow, we have the right to appoint a lawyer and appeal to the judiciary. Without institutions and rules our life would be chancy, unpredictable and fickle. We would inhabit a space empty of certainties, expectations, aspirations and evaluations.Rules, not whimsIn a democracy, individuals are governed by institutions, and not by men. If we do not live in an institutional universe, we will be at the mercy of capricious individuals. Democrats would rather be administered by a system of rules we can scrutinise and evaluate. Of course, rules can be, and are, unfair. But at least we can struggle against rules. We do not have to commit murders to get the ruling dispensation out of power. We might have to carry out a thousand peaceful demonstrations, approach the courts, lobby our legislative representatives, engage in civil disobedience, or withhold our vote. In a world stamped by the decline of institutions and the exercise of arbitrary power, the only way to dislodge a government is through violence.The present government has tampered with institutions by appointing its own people to positions of authority, and by using the Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax authorities, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the police as bulldozers to flatten out any site of opposition. In civil society, human rights organisations have been pulverised by blockage of funds, raids and arrests. The shameful way in which human rights activists have been incarcerated without a shred of evidence testifies to the subversion of the rule of law. The ultimate aim of government action is to dismantle institutions, and the delicate relationship of checks and balances among them. This bodes ill for democracy.The development contravenes the spirit of the freedom struggle. As far back as the 1928 Motilal Nehru constitutional draft, the leadership of the national movement opted for constitutionalism to abridge unpredictable use of power, and grant basic rights to citizens. On November 4, 1948, B.R. Ambedkar, responding to criticism of the draft Constitution in the Constituent Assembly, clarified that the Constitution provided but a framework for future governments. But: “If things go wrong under the new Constitution, the reason will not be that we have a bad constitution. What we will have to say is that Man was vile.” The Indian Constitution established major political institutions, Parliament, executive and the judiciary, laid out the relationship between them, provided for judicial review, and codified political and civil rights. The constitutional framework does not provide thick or substantive conceptions of how we shall think, and in what we shall believe. It provides us with a thin framework that guarantees constitutional morality, or respect for the Constitution as the basis of political life.Today the ruling party wants to legislate a thick conception of the good. We are instructed to worship the nation, respect the cow, glorify the coercive arm of the state, and listen on bended knees to leaders. Frankly the discourse is reminiscent of the naïve, and often crude, nationalist scripts authored and acted out by the film star Manoj Kumar in the 1960s. We can avoid watching his films without fear of harassment, but we cannot defy the government without being abused and subjected to violence of the pen and tongue.Upending the balanceThe government arrests civil society activists who engage with policy, and vigilante groups attack individuals who dare transport cattle, legitimately, from one part of India to another. Immediately the sympathies of the police and magistrates, some sections of the media and public opinion swing towards the perpetrator, not the victim. The leaders of our ruling dispensation seem to have no respect for the rule of law, nor for the rules that regulate speech in public spaces.Ultimately institutionalised power that is subject to regulation, and that can withstand the scrutiny of the political public, is meant to protect citizens. Unfortunately, in the India of today institutions are used to protect the ruling class, and its sins of omission and commission. The people who rule us should know that when the relationship between citizens and the state is governed not by institutions but by individuals, politics takes to the streets. And then a thousand revolts happen. We pay heavily for institutional decline.Neera Chandhoke is a former Professor of Political Science at Delhi University"
Tharoor seeks law to undo SC verdict on Sabarimala temple,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sabarimala-row-tharoor-seeks-law-to-protect-temple-traditions/article26189129.ece,"
Cong. leader says it is hypocrisy to create stir when there is majority to pass a law
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on Tuesday that the Centre should initiate legislative process to protect the freedom of places of worship.Mr. Tharoor, Member of Parliament from Thiruvananthapuram, raised the issue in the Lok Sabha during Zero Hour. He said only a law to undo the Supreme Court order on Sabarimala — allowing women of menstruating age to enter the temple — would pacify the protesters.“I urge the Government to come up with a legislative action to ensure and protect the freedom of religious places and worship in principle with constitutional values because we need to clarify the application of essential religious practices,” he told the Lok Sabha.Vandalism, violenceWithout naming the BJP that has been at the forefront of the protests in Kerala, the Congress MP said protests of “genuine believers” had been hijacked for political gains. “Irresponsible parties have been trying to hijack protests by genuine believers in a bid to reap political dividends. They have been engaging in vandalism and violence, not only disrupting the law and order in the State, but also disturbing the sanctity of the holy abode of Lord Ayyappa,” he said.“This problem can only be solved either through a judicial process in the form of a review of the honourable Supreme Court’s judgment or through a legislative action by Parliament. It is hypocrisy to create violence and protests when you have the majority to pass a law,” Mr. Tharoor said.Though the Congress had welcomed the Supreme Court ruling as a landmark judgment, the party has changed its position in the past few weeks.Last month, at a public meeting with the Indian diaspora in Dubai, Congress president Rahul Gandhi too had changed his earlier position strongly supporting the top court’s position.“People should be allowed to decide on the issue,” he said."

In a U-turn, Kerala's Travancore Devaswom Board supported entry of women of all ages
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its verdict on a batch of petitions seeking review of its judgment which lifted the bar on menstruating women from worshipping at Sabarimala temple in Kerala.A Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi presided over a day-long clash over its September 28, 2018 judgment.Also ReadKerala govt opposes pleas seeking review of SC’s Sabarimala verdictA whopping 65 petitions, including review pleas and writs, challenged the authority of the Supreme Court to intervene with a “centuries’ old” belief that the Sabarimala deity is aNaishtika Brahmachariwhose penance should not be disturbed by the entry of women worshippers of the menstruating age of 10 to 50 years.On the other hand, senior advocate Indira Jaising, representing Bindu and Kanakadurga — the two women who fought the odds to enter the Sabarimala premises, said it was the fundamental duty of citizens under Article 51A (h) of the Constitution to “develop scientific temper, humanism, spirit of enquiry and reform”. That is what the Supreme Court judgment urges citizens to do.“What about Article 51A (e)? To promote harmony and common brotherhood...” Justice Rohinton Nariman on the Constitution Bench asked.“It hurts a woman very, very deeply to say she is polluted because she menstruates. The hurt caused by such discrimination goes to the heart of the Constitution,” Ms. Jaising submitted to the Bench.The majority judgment in September 2018 concluded that the exclusion of menstruating women from Sabarimala temple was akin to treating them as the children of a “lesser God”. It had said exclusion of any kind, especially based on a biological attribute, amounted to practice of untouchability, an abolished social evil.But on Wednesday, Nair Service Society (NSS), represented by veteran lawyer K. Parasaran, sought a review of the verdict on the ground that the exclusion at Sabarimala temple was not based on gender or sex, but on religious faith in and character of the deity.Also ReadSabarimala: In a U-turn, Kerala's Travancore Devaswom Board supports entry of women of all agesThe temple’s chief priest Rajeevaru Kandararu, who is the main review petitioner, argued that “every devotee has a fundamental right to worship in a temple in a manner which is in sync with the character of the deity”.“Thanthri [priest] is the father of the deity. Every deity has a character. The Sabarimala deity, unlike in other Ayyappa temples, has the peculiar character of aNaishtika Brahmachari. The essential religious nature of Sabarimala deity is affirmed and perpetuated everyday by the offerings/pujas conducted in the temple. All this rests on this unique character of the deity. Exclusion of women of a certain age is nothing on moral or immoral,” senior advocate V. Giri argued for the priest.Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi for the former chairman of Travancore Devaswom Board, which controls the temple, said “In Hindu religion, god is worshipped in different manifestations... Devotees have to worship in sync with characteristics of that manifestation to attain salvation.”“What is the effect of your Sabarimala judgment? It is a mandamus given to a particular religious community that you shall not hold this belief!” asked senior advocate Shekhar Naphade.“Hinduism is the most diverse religion on planet Earth. And here, you want to allow only practices or customs which are ‘universally ethical’ to all Hindus? Is it possible? Surely, that’s not the right approach to take in such a diverse religion?” Mr. Singhvi went on to criticise the September judgment.But Kerala government countered the review petition, saying courts can set aside religious practices which oversaw fundamental rights like dignity of women. “Touchstone of our Constitution is ‘you will not discriminate or exclude’,” senior advocate Jaideep Gupta submitted for the State.The Travancore Devaswom Board supported the State, saying the spirit of the Sabarimala judgment is equal entitlement for man and woman in society.But Ms. Jaising said her two clients have faced death threats and social exclusion for daring to worship at Sabarimala.Lastly, advocate P.V. Dinesh, appearing for two other Kerala-based women who filed a contempt of court petition, asked the court, “If it is believed that a 10-year-old girl child can breach theNaishtikaBrahmacharyamof a God, then a child is being portrayed as a sexual object?”"

Pope Francis celebrates historic Mass in Arabian Peninsula,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pope-francis-to-hold-historic-mass-on-arabian-peninsula/article26181507.ece,"
The Emirates’ Catholic community is something an anomaly for the region large, diverse and thriving at a time when the wider Mideast has seen an exodus of Christians fleeing persecution at the hands of the Islamic State group and others.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Pope Francis ministered on Tuesday to the thriving Catholic community in the United Arab Emirates as he concluded his historic visit to the Arabian Peninsula with the first-ever papal Mass here and a call for his flock to remain meek in following God.A day after making a broad appeal for Christian and Muslim leaders to work together to promote peace and reject war, Francis celebrated what some considered the largest show of public Christian worship on the peninsula, the birthplace of Islam.For the Gulf Arab region where public displays of non-Islamic faith are restricted, the hymns of “Halleluja” booming out from speakers marked a milestone and evidence of the Emirates’ much touted assertions of its tolerance for other faiths.Cheers erupted inside and outside the Zayed Sports City Stadium as Francis arrived and looped through the crowd in his open-sided popemobile, as chants of “Viva il Papa” and “We love you!” echoed from the crowd, estimated to be around 135,000.Organizers said faithful from 100 countries would attend, as well as 4,000 Muslims from this Muslim federation evidence of the enormous diversity among the 9 million people who live in the UAE.“We have to say it is really a big event for us which we never expected,” said Sumitha Pinto, and Indian native who has lived in the UAE for nearly 20 years. She attended the Mass with her husband and four sons, the youngest of whom held up sign with the pope’s photo that read- “Welcome Pope Francis. Make Me a Channel of Your Peace.”The Emirates’ Catholic community is something an anomaly for the region large, diverse and thriving at a time when the wider Mideast has seen an exodus of Christians fleeing persecution at the hands of the Islamic State group and others.The Catholic Church estimates as many as 1 million of the over 9 million living in the UAE are Catholic, nearly all of them foreigners drawn to the oil-rich federation to work in everything from white-collar finance to construction. Most are Filipino and Indian, many of whom have left behind families back home in order to come here and work. They can face precarious labor conditions, which human rights groups regularly denounce.In his homily, delivered in Italian and translated into Arabic with English subtitles on giant screens, Pope Francis made a direct reference to the sufferings many endure.“It is most certainly not easy for you to live far from home, missing the affection of your loved ones, and perhaps also feeling uncertainty about the future,” he said. “But the Lord is faithful and does not abandon his people.”Pope Francis also told his flock many of them poor, manual laborers that they need not build great “superhuman” works to be faithful. It was a message extolling meekness in a country that is home to the world’s biggest skyscraper and is known for its opulence and excess.An Emirati official takes a selfie ahead of Pope Francis Mass at the Sheikh Zayed Sports City in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
 
| Photo Credit:APJesus, Pope Francis said, “did not ask us to build great works or draw attention to ourselves with extraordinary gestures. He asked us to produce just one work of art, possible for everyone- our own life.”The crowd was elated and appreciated the Pope’s words.In an indication of the diversity of the Catholic flock, the prayers during Mass were being read out in a variety of languages and addressed the variety of hardships many face.A prayer in Konkani called for public officials to be “illuminated” and promote the dignity of all, while the one in the Filipino language of Tagalog urged prayers for migrants and workers in in the UAE so that “their sacrifice and work may blossom and sustain their families.” The one in French called for those who foment violence to change their ways and “stop wars, overcome hatred and help us forge links of justice and peace.”Pope Francis’ visit, 800 years after his peace-loving namesake St. Francis of Assisi visited an Egyptian sultan, marked the culmination of years of Holy See efforts to improve relations with the Muslim world after they hit a low during the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI. Since then, religious fanaticism and faith-inspired wars have only grown around the globe, inspiring the pontiff’s efforts to promote tolerance and understanding."

Directs Centre to give extra pay to those posted in the Maoist violence-hit town
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Delhi High Court has directed the Centre to give ‘risk/hard area allowance’ to Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel who are posted in Maoist-affected Damanjodi in Odisha to provide security to National Aluminium Company Limited (NALCO).The High Court ruling came after a serving Deputy Commandant of CISF, Satyendra Kumar Jha, challenged the decision of the Centre to reject risk/hardship based allowance to CISF personnel posted at the Public Sector Undertaking.CISF circularsMr. Jha, in his plea, contended that he was not granted ‘risk/hard area allowance’ after he was posted to the CISF unit at NALCO, Damanjodi from April 2016.He argued that a 2011 CISF circular identified Damanjodi as a Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected area. Another 2015 CISF circular also declared CISF unit at NALCO, Damanjodi in Koraput district as a ‘hard area unit’.Mr. Jha pointed out that as per the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the CISF unit, NALCO, it is required to conduct counter-Maoist operations.He said that the base of the CISF unit is at Damanjodi whereas the mines area is 20 km away. The road connecting the two is undulated and is highly susceptible to attack or ambush by the Maoists.Maoist attacksHighlighting several incidents of Maoist attacks, Mr. Jha said in 2009 the CISF personnel valiantly foiled the Maoist attack to loot explosives at the mines of NALCO.Unfortunately, 10 CISF personnel were killed, four of whom were posthumously awarded the President’s Police Medal and the remaining six were awarded Police Medals.In terms of the statistics of the Maoist violence in Odisha, Mr. Jha pointed out that Koraput district was amongst the most severely affected on account of Left Wing Extremism (LWE).While the Centre defended it decision to refuse hardship-based allowance to the CISF unit at NALCO since it was a ‘static location’, a Bench of Justice S. Muralidhar and Justice Sanjeev Narula opined otherwise saying it was a field posting.The Bench said Mr. Jha’s posting with the CISF unit at NALCO would stand covered by the Home Ministry’s April 2009 circular which provides for risk or hardship-based allowance to combatised Central Paramilitary Forces personnel up to the rank of Commandant.It additionally said that the MHA should on its own grant the above relief to all those similarly placed personnel of the CISF unit at NALCO without their having to file separate petitions."

Says police were unable to help victims in the absence of legislation ",,"The Centre has informed the Madras High Court that it was forced to promulgate an ordinance making Talaq-e-biddat (the practice of Muslim men divorcing their wives by pronouncing the word ‘talaq’ thrice) a criminal offence because the practice continued unabated across the country despite the Supreme Court holding it as unconstitutional.In a counter affidavit filed before a Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and Subramonium Prasad, the Union Law Ministry stated that the government in its wisdom had thought it fit to promulgate the ordinance also because the police officers were helpless and could not initiate any punitive action whenever victims of Talaq-e-biddat lodged complaints.Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan submitted the counter affidavit in reply to a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate S. Hussain Afroze who had challenged the constitutional validity of the ordinance.The counter recalled that the Supreme Court had declared triple Talaq unconstitutional in Shayara Bano’s case in August 2017.During the course of the hearing of the case, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board too had assured the court that it would prescribe guidelines to be followed in matters of divorce and urge Muslims to avoid Talaq-e-biddat. Despite such an undertaking and court ruling against the practice, the “menace” continued to be reported from various parts of the country.“It was also reported in various news channels and dailies that even educated persons are resorting to divorce their wives by adopting instantaneous and irrevocable Talaq... In the absence of any punitive provisions in the extant laws, the police were helpless and no action could be taken against the errant husbands,” the counter read.Inadequate reliefThough the victimscould seek relief under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005, “the reliefs under the said Act are ineffective against Triple Talaq... Therefore, it is considered necessary to have a standalone legislation and hence there is no unconstitutionality as averred by the petitioner,” it added.It was also brought to the notice of the court that the ordinance was promulgated even as the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill of 2017 was passed by the Lok Sabha on December 28, 2017, and was pending in the Rajya Sabha. The Ministry also said that few other High Courts in the country had already dismissed cases challenging the ordinance.The ASG told the court that the present writ petitioner would have to amend his prayer since he had filed the case last year challenging the 2018 ordinance, which the Centre replaced with a fresh ordinance on the same subject on January 12, 2019."
‘Why must we tell you our story?’,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/why-must-we-tell-you-our-story/article26176647.ece,"
Often people revisit traumatic memories only to tell journalists their stories ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"As journalists, we are often guilty of behaving like an entitled bunch. We ask questions, demand answers, call people at odd hours with or without an apology, or trouble a friend for a phone number we have lost.It is one thing to pose difficult questions to those in power, those who are accountable to the people, or those who think privilege ought not to be challenged. But it is quite another to nudge people who are in the lap of danger or adversity to share their stories with us, so we can tell them.It was late 2003, and I was in journalism school. A group of us were taken to Pappapatti, Keeripatti and Nattamangalam in Madurai district to try to understand, and report on the entrenched caste hegemony that was reflected in the periodic violence that militant sections of the dominant Thevar caste group unleashed on the oppressed Dalits. Despite the panchayats being reserved for Dalit candidates, most were forced to stay out of the contest. The few who took a risk paid with physical injury or, at times, life.We approached a middle-aged woman in the Dalit village, hoping to get her perspective. “Why must we tell you?” she screamed. “Who are you? So many media folk come here and ask us questions, but has anything changed for us?

Often people revisit traumatic memories only to tell journalists their stories
",,"As journalists, we are often guilty of behaving like an entitled bunch. We ask questions, demand answers, call people at odd hours with or without an apology, or trouble a friend for a phone number we have lost.It is one thing to pose difficult questions to those in power, those who are accountable to the people, or those who think privilege ought not to be challenged. But it is quite another to nudge people who are in the lap of danger or adversity to share their stories with us, so we can tell them.It was late 2003, and I was in journalism school. A group of us were taken to Pappapatti, Keeripatti and Nattamangalam in Madurai district to try to understand, and report on the entrenched caste hegemony that was reflected in the periodic violence that militant sections of the dominant Thevar caste group unleashed on the oppressed Dalits. Despite the panchayats being reserved for Dalit candidates, most were forced to stay out of the contest. The few who took a risk paid with physical injury or, at times, life.We approached a middle-aged woman in the Dalit village, hoping to get her perspective. “Why must we tell you?” she screamed. “Who are you? So many media folk come here and ask us questions, but has anything changed for us? Can you assure me that you can publish the truth and make a difference?” Obviously, we couldn’t promise change, but we reported what we saw.About a decade later, in 2012, I went to Idinthakarai in Tirunelveli district to report on how locals felt about the imminent commissioning of the controversial Kudankulam nuclear power plant.

In his address, the pontiff pushed the need for justice, equality of citizens’ rights and an end to all wars, including in Yemen.UAE and Saudi Arabia are key allies of the Yemeni government, which is locked in a war against Iran-backed rebels that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.The pope said all religious leaders had a “duty to reject every nuance of approval from the word war”. “I am thinking in particular of Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Libya.”Sheikh Ahmed, who stressed in a speech that religion must never be used to justify violence, and the pope signed a document that Al-Azhar and the Vatican will work together to fight extremism.The pope was earlier accorded a royal welcome at Abu Dhabi’s presidential palace. Officers fired 21 shots in the air, while jets flew overhead leaving white and yellow trails — the colours of the Vatican City flag. He later held talks with Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and other UAE leaders.Sheikh Mohammed said UAE rulers were “delighted” to meet the pontiff “in our homeland of tolerance”. “We discussed enhancing cooperation, consolidating dialogue, tolerance, human coexistence and important initiatives to achieve peace, stability and development for peoples and societies,” he tweeted."
Talaq made punishable offence as practice continued: Centre,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/triple-talaq-made-punishable-offence-as-practice-continued-centre-tells-hc/article26179853.ece,"
Says police were unable to help victims in the absence of legislation
",,"The Centre has informed the Madras High Court that it was forced to promulgate an ordinance making Talaq-e-biddat (the practice of Muslim men divorcing their wives by pronouncing the word ‘talaq’ thrice) a criminal offence because the practice continued unabated across the country despite the Supreme Court holding it as unconstitutional.In a counter affidavit filed before a Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and Subramonium Prasad, the Union Law Ministry stated that the government in its wisdom had thought it fit to promulgate the ordinance also because the police officers were helpless and could not initiate any punitive action whenever victims of Talaq-e-biddat lodged complaints.Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan submitted the counter affidavit in reply to a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate S. Hussain Afroze who had challenged the constitutional validity of the ordinance. The counter recalled that the Supreme Court had declared triple Talaq unconstitutional in Shayara Bano’s case in August 2017.During the course of the hearing of the case, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board too had assured the court that it would prescribe guidelines to be followed in matters of divorce and urge Muslims to avoid Talaq-e-biddat. Despite such an undertaking and court ruling against the practice, the “menace” continued to be reported from various parts of the country.“It was also reported in various news channels and dailies that even educated persons are resorting to divorce their wives by adopting instantaneous and irrevocable Talaq... In the absence of any punitive provisions in the extant laws, the police were helpless and no action could be taken against the errant husbands,” the counter read.Inadequate reliefThough the victimscould seek relief under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005, “the reliefs under the said Act are ineffective against Triple Talaq... Therefore, it is considered necessary to have a standalone legislation and hence there is no unconstitutionality as averred by the petitioner,” it added.It was also brought to the notice of the court that the ordinance was promulgated even as the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill of 2017 was passed by the Lok Sabha on December 28, 2017, and was pending in the Rajya Sabha. The Ministry also said that few other High Courts in the country had already dismissed cases challenging the ordinance.When the PIL petition was taken up for hearing on Monday, the ASG told the court that the present writ petitioner would have to amend his prayer since he had filed the case last year challenging the 2018 ordinance, which was repealed by the Centre early this year and replaced it by promulgating a fresh ordinance on the same subject on January 12 this year.Even educated persons are resorting to divorce their wives by adopting TalaqG.

Their conduct was against the Indian ethos and shows the scant regard they have for the values of non-violence, peace and compassion advocated by Mahatma Gandhi,” he said.R.

The exchange of wedding gifts two days later was the highpoint.On February 1, more than 6,000 guests turned up at the reception the newlyweds hosted at Mr. Rabha’s residence in No. 2 Kataligaon (Rabhasupa), a village in western Assam’s Baksa district.About 350 of them received a sapling each in exchange for a bundle of old clothes they were requested to bring as a wedding gift.About 90 km west of Guwahati, No. 2 Kataligaon is officially Baksa district’s cleanest village and seen as the best in performing community service.“We had, before the marriage, met village elders and discussed the idea of using the reception party as a platform for encouraging people to donate clothes for the poor as well as to take a step towards greening our surroundings. The villagers liked the idea,” the 34-year-old Mr. Rabha, who teaches English at a college and acts in regional films, said on Sunday.Sachin Das, the Batabari Range Officer of Baska Forest Division, saw in the couple’s idea an opportunity to take the department’s social forestry campaign to the backyard of the villagers.“I gave them 350 saplings of local species of trees, such asnageshwar(Indian rose chestnut),krishnachura(flame tree), andbokul(Spanish cherry),” he said.Mr. Rabha and Ms. Boro handed over a sapling each to 350 guests who brought old clothes. A record was kept of those who could not be given a sapling, and of those who promised to bring old clothes later.More trees to give“We will try to carry on the programme of giving a return gift of a sapling until all the guests are covered,” Mr. Rabha, who gifted new blankets to about a dozen homeless people in the area on his wedding day, said.Ms. Boro, who teaches at a private school in a nearby town, hoped the sapling-for-old clothes idea would catch on with more people in the area. “Weddings mean gifting precious metals or cash or consumer durables. These things aren’t as priceless as investing in the society or the environment,” she said.Sandis Laime, Mr. Rabha’s best mate at the wedding, came all the way from Latvia to cherish the moment. “This wedding has been special,” he said.Mr. Laime and Mr. Rabha had met in 2012 when they researched witch-hunting and witchcraft, which often leads to violence in Assam. The two plan to pursue a few more projects in the future."

‘Alarmed by her record, particularly around gender rights’
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A group of 54 South Asian women, including professors, lawyers and human rights activists, have written a letter on Monday to (Republican) Senator Lindsay Graham, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and its ranking Democrat, Senator Diane Feinstein, expressing concerns about Indian American Neomi Rao’s candidacy for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.“We firmly believe in the importance of a diverse federal judiciary, and it is not lost upon us that if confirmed, Neomi Rao would be the first South Asian American woman to sit on a federal appellate court,” the letter says, adding, “However, we are deeply alarmed by Neomi Rao’s record, particularly around gender rights, and we do not believe that she will bring independence and fairness to the federal bench.”Ms. Rao, whose parents are from India, will, if confirmed, sit on what is considered the country’s second most powerful court. She will replace the vacancy created by Brett Kavanaugh’s controversial elevation to the U.S. Supreme Court last year.“Rao’s policy decisions have led to the rollbacks of public protections relied upon by vulnerable communities, including women, survivors of sexual violence, and LGBTQ people,” the letter says.Ms. Rao currently leads the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), and is in charge of conducting cost benefit analyses for government regulations and deciding how to proceed with U.S. President Donald Trump’s agenda of deregulation.‘Deeply troubling’The letter referred to Ms. Rao undoing the “equal pay initiative”, an Obama-era rule that had not yet come into force, requiring employers to collect data on what they pay workers and workers’ race, ethnicity and gender. The letter also points to OIRA vetting a Department of Education proposed rule that would weaken civil rights protections to survivors of sexual assault and calls “deeply troubling, Ms. Rao considering a rule that would allow healthcare providers to deny medical care to LGBTQ individuals and women seeking reproductive healthcare.The activists have provided evidence of Ms. Rao’s views that dates back to her days in college. “And if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was a part of her choice,” Ms. Rao wrote on consent issues in theYale Heraldin 1994, while a final year undergraduate at Yale University.“This is victim-blaming and rape apologist language, and it has no place in our society, let alone the federal judiciary,” the letter said.‘Not the role model’An article that Ms. Rao wrote in 1994 for theWashington Timeshas also landed her in controversy now. She writes of multiculturalists, “Underneath their touchy-feely talk of tolerance, they seek to undermine American culture.” In that same piece, she also writes, “Martin Luther King Jr. dreamt that one day people would be judged by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin. This dream has no meaning to the multiculturalists.”“She is not the role model we need for our community and certainly not the one I want for my daughter,” Shiwali Patel, senior counsel at National Women’s Law Center, a non-profit organisation, said on a briefing call held by activists last Friday.Ms. Rao’s confirmation hearing at the Senate will begin on Tuesday.The Hindureached out to the White House on Monday for a comment on the issue."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A plainclothes squad early on Sunday arrested Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) district leader Praveen in connection with the country bomb attack on Nedumangad police station during the peak of the Sangh Parivar-sponsored agitation against the entry of women of reproductive age to Sabarimala shrine in early January.A team led by DySP, Nedumangadu, D. Asokan, had been on a stake-out at the Central Railway Station, Thampanoor, since Saturday after they received information that the accused would try to board a train to North Kerala. Undercover officers arrested Praveen when he entered the station and hustled him away in a police van to the Nedumangad station.The police had incriminated the RSS pracharak in the case after surveillance footage of him hurling four country bombs in close succession at the station house surfaced in the media.Also ReadWeapons seized from RSS officeThe incident happened on January 2 when Kerala experienced violence after two women, Bindu Ammini and Kanaka Durga, worshipped at the Sabarimala temple, upending a lengthy ban on women between the age of 10 and 50 from entering the sanctum.On September 28, 2018,the Supreme Court lifted that ban on entering the Lord Ayyappa temple. The verdict then led to a stand-off between the Government and Hindu right-wing outfits determined to stop the State from upholding the judgement.The country bomb attack on the police station was the highlight of the Sabarimala Karma Samathi (SKS) initiated hartal that resulted in destruction of public property and attacks on law enforcers, journalists, party houses of political functionaries across Kerala.The violence had resulted in the registration of 1,369 cases and the arrest and incarceration of over 900 persons, an overwhelming number of them SKS, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and RSS workers on charges of damaging public property, attacks on officers, arson, unlawful assembly and rioting.Officers said Praveen, a resident of Nooranad, was politically active in Nedumangad for several years. He was accused in many cases of causing hurt, including a charge of attempted murder. The court had earlier rejected his plea for anticipatory bail.The police had raided the houses of his relatives in Kollam, triggering accusations of harassment and at least one petition in the High Court. They had issued a wanted person notice against Praveen and arrested at least five persons, including his brother, on the charge of having harboured a fugitive from the law.The police said they would produce Praveen before a magistrate and seek his return to police custody for further questioning."

A couple in Assam asks guests to give them old clothes on their big day, and take back saplings
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When Bhupen Rabha tied the knot with Bobeeta Boro on January 30, they turned it into an occasion for social service and conservation of the environment. The exchange of wedding gifts two days later was the highpoint.On February 1, more than 6,000 guests turned up at the reception the newlyweds hosted at Mr. Rabha’s residence in No. 2 Kataligaon (Rabhasupa), a village in western Assam’s Baksa district.About 350 of them received a sapling each in exchange for a bundle of old clothes they were requested to bring as a wedding gift.About 90 km west of Guwahati, No. 2 Kataligaon is officially Baksa district’s cleanest village and seen as the best in performing community service.“We had, before the marriage, met village elders and discussed the idea of using the reception party as a platform for encouraging people to donate clothes for the poor as well as to take a step towards greening our surroundings. The villagers liked the idea,” the 34-year-old Mr. Rabha, who teaches English at a college and acts in regional films, said on Sunday.Sachin Das, the Batabari Range Officer of Baska Forest Division, saw in the couple’s idea an opportunity to take the department’s social forestry campaign to the backyard of the villagers.“I gave them 350 saplings of local species of trees, such asnageshwar(Indian rose chestnut),krishnachura(flame tree), andbokul(Spanish cherry),” he said.Mr. Rabha and Ms. Boro handed over a sapling each to 350 guests who brought old clothes. A record was kept of those who could not be given a sapling, and of those who promised to bring old clothes later.More trees to give“We will try to carry on the programme of giving a return gift of a sapling until all the guests are covered,” Mr. Rabha, who gifted new blankets to about a dozen homeless people in the area on his wedding day, said.Ms. Boro, who teaches at a private school in a nearby town, hoped the sapling-for-old clothes idea would catch on with more people in the area. “Weddings mean gifting precious metals or cash or consumer durables. These things aren’t as priceless as investing in the society or the environment,” she said.Sandis Laime, Mr. Rabha’s best mate at the wedding, came all the way from Latvia to cherish the moment. “This wedding has been special,” he said.Mr. Laime and Mr. Rabha had met in 2012 when they researched witch-hunting and witchcraft, which often leads to violence in Assam. The two plan to pursue a few more projects in the future."

A sweet story that shines more because January’s releases have been so awful
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The year has just begun but January is already staking a claim to being the cruellest month for Hindi cinema. Propaganda, jingoism and parochialism; aggression, conflicts and attacks; latent hostility and outright hatred — there’s a lot of negativity on screen in the overblown hagiographies and obsequious recreations of events from the recent past.It has taken a bunch of children in a Marathi film calledDhappato change the overriding narrative of belligerence and sectarianism, and underscore the spirit of camaraderie, inclusivity and harmony. The adults may have lost the plot but the kids are certainly alright.Winner of the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration,Dhappahas been directed by Nipun Avinash Dharmadhikari and co-produced by two of the finest talents in Marathi cinema, filmmaker Umesh Kulkarni and actor Girish Kulkarni, who has also written the story and screenplay, inspired from a true incident.Outside the bubbleThe children inDhappadon’t just feel real but Girish also makes their views shine through; and pivots the film on their perspective. “In India, we hardly have any films where children actually feel like children. It’s like the point-of-view of a grown-up has been imposed on the child’s psyche,” says Umesh.Girish has managed the near impossible: he has penned a children’s film that steers clear of moral grandstanding and doesn’t talk down to them. It’s about children going on a journey of self-discovery all by themselves. In one of the film’s most resonating scenes, the father of a physically challenged child approves of him getting out of his bubble to confront the ugliness in the world. How else will he be able to test his own mettle?Sweet and simpleDhappakicks off with delightful little childhood vignettes — the banter and bickering in the autorickshaw ride from school, the silly fights with the apartment grinch, playing cupid to a couple of lovestruck youngsters, and evading the clutches of the overzealous grandmother.Dhappafeels like a straight, sweet and simple slice of middle-class life, the kind we associate with the cinema of Sai Paranjape, Basu Chatterjee and Hrishikesh Mukherjee.In fact, it seems as though there isn’t much else going on, until the apartment complex decides to stage a play on environment issues for Ganesh Chaturthi. A drama on trees that walk, a monkey that talks, and time-travel, it brings together Jesus Christ and Sant Tukaram as they break bread and bhaakri on stage, while chiding human beings for reducing earth to a disaster zone. The play riles the local politician/ goon, Bhau, who can’t digest the blurring of religious and cultural boundaries. The only way he can retort is through force and violence.How will the children counter him?Dhappamay feel sentimental and cute in turns but it certainly isn’t shorn of profundity. “You need a child’s mind to understand complex issues,” says Umesh. It’s why the youngsters don’t find anything offensive about Christ being a part of the Ganesh festival.The film is about the urgency to return to the simplicity and innocence of a child. Caste, class, and religious disparities may be all around but the children are able to rise above it all. They are the ones who hold a candle for tolerance. Therein lies much-needed subtlety and nuance.It’s a simple slice of middle-class life, the kind we associate with Paranjape and Mukherjee"

Why so many countries are involved in Syria’s war
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When protests in Syria against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad that broke out in March 2011 turned into a full-scale civil war, many nations, especially those in the West, thought Assad’s dates were numbered. The U.S. called for his resignation. The EU backed rebels and housed the political branch of the Syrian opposition. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan were involved in varying degrees in the conflict through their proxies. But almost eight years on, Assad has not only survived, but almost won the most disastrous civil conflict in post-war West Asia. This wouldn’t have been possible without help from Iran, Russia and the Hezbollah, Syria’s strongest allies. Ghaidaa Hetou, an academic and the founder of iStrategic LlC, a U.S.-based political risk analysis firm, tells this story inThe Syrian Conflict: The Role of Russia, Iran and the US in a Global Crisis.Much has already been written on the Syrian crisis. But this literature is largely focused on Syria’s internal dynamics explaining the causes of the conflict. But Hetou sees the Syrian conflict through the geopolitical prism. She doesn’t dispute the arguments that the initial response of the Assad regime towards peaceful protesters was brutal. But she also says the Syrian government had taken some reform measures in 2012, including passing a new Constitution, “which was by many accounts a fundamental step towards political reform”. The new Constitution abolished a fundamental Article that had practically guaranteed the one-party rule of Assad’s Baath Party. But this measure failed to end violence. Nor did foreign countries who backed rebels accept this as a measure of reconciliation. As the war went on, first Iran, then Hezbollah and finally Russia came for the regime.For Iran, the survival of the Assad regime was vital for its own interests. “The diplomatic amalgam of the Syrian opposition and the international recognition that they received, as the only legitimate representative of the Syrian people by the U.S., EU and GCC was further proof, from Iran’s perspective, that this was indeed a Western manufactured crisis.” As for Russia, by interfering in Syria, it sent a message to Western powers about its foreign policy resolve.While Hetou convincingly lays out this geopolitical narrative, the book lacks a moral argument given that at least 400,000 people were killed in Syria and millions were displaced. In places it also reads like a compilation of news reports as the author is rebuilding developments drily and chronologically since the outbreak of the crisis. Still the perspective it offers distinguishes it from other books on Syria."

A documentary resurrects the 1960 tour by Assam’s Bhupen Hazarika and Bengal’s Hemango Biswas at the peak of the Assamese-Bengali conflict
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With cracks resurfacing in the relationship between the Assamese and the Bengalis due to the updation of the National Register of Citizens in Assam, a documentary intends to serve as a reminder of how music brought peace to Assam during the language riots of 1960.The documentary has been made by Rongili Biswas, daughter of legendary Bengali singer Hemango Biswas. As a precursor to the film, she has released online a music album, titled ‘Hemango-Bhupen: A Song for Everyone — Tales of the 1960 peace initiative against the linguistic riots in Assam’.The tracks play in the background while stills — many of them rare photographs — tell the story of the 1960 riots, which broke out after Assamese was made the State language. This triggered large-scale violence and arson across Assam, home to many Bengalis.It was then that Bengal’s Hemango Biswas and Assam’s Bhupen Hazarika (singer-lyricist recently honoured with Bharat Ratna) travelled with a peace caravan to pacify the mobs.The duo travelled with a 30-member caravan across undivided Assam. “The artists came from all walks of life, representing a very rich folk tradition of various communities of Assam. Predominantly, they were from the Assam chapter of the leftist cultural movement IPTA (Indian People’s Theatre Association), which completed its 75th year in 2018,” said Ms. Biswas, an academic and musician in her own right.Ms. Biswas made the documentary, ‘A Song for Everyone’, with a grant from the Benguluru-based India Foundation for the Arts. The title has been borrowed from a poem on the mission, composed by the Bengal poet Shankha Ghosh. “But I need to re-edit the film,” Ms. Biswas said.Many hurdlesIn the film, Ms. Biswas has interviewed many of the dancers, singers and musicians — now mostly in their late eighties — associated with the 1960 caravan. They narrate how the caravan slowly evolved, overcoming obstacles.“It was not an easy situation,” recalls Uma Dutta, a danseuse with the troupe, in the film. “A local person told us before our performance in Goreswar (in northwest Assam), one of the worst-hit areas: “You Bengalis (there was another Bengali dancer, Sandhya Das) have come to perform here. Don’t you know how Bengali women were tortured here a few days back?’”Hemango Biswas noted in a small piece, ‘Let Us Meet – A report on 1960 Peace Mission’, that at almost every step of organising the event, for which he summoned Bhupen Hazarika from Kolkata, the team had to negotiate hurdles: “…both the communities tried to dissuade us. Some even made fun of us.” But the show – which had artists from Khasi, Jayantia, Nepali, Assamese and Bengali communities – was a resounding success.Shillong Observerhad noted, “Out of the gloom of riot-torn life we emerge as brothers, each with distinctive culture and language orchestrated into a magnificent harmony united in creative labour for a prosperous future.”The high point of the performance was a song, specially produced for the occasion by Hazarika and Biswas,Haradhan-Rongmon Katha, a conversational ballad that narrated the story of two farmers Haradhan and Rongmon, one Bengali and another Assamese, who had come together to survive in the backdrop of a fratricidal riot.“Just as Bhupen’s sensitive and mellifluous voice resonated with the sorrows of Haradhan, perhaps the meandering strains of Bhatiali in my voice too echoed Rongmon’s grief. The audience was overwhelmed,” noted Biswas.Strikes a chord“I remember after the programme in Nagaon, one of worst riot-hit areas, as Hemangoda and Bhupenda came down from the stage, with arms around each other, many people started crying,” recalls Ruby Hazarika, a team member. “The Gopinath Bordoloi Hall was chock-a-block and the song had a huge emotional impact,” remembers Gyanada Bora, who attended the performance as a school student.Bhupen Hazarika, who joined the BJP much later in 2004, joined IPTA after his return from the U.S. around 1952 and was “one of the most active and creative members of IPTA”, noted Hemango Biswas.Their friendship consolidated as they jointly organised the third Assam conference of IPTA in 1955, when the likes of Balraj Sahni, Salil Chowdhury and Hemanta Mukherjee participated, among others.So in 1960, “Bhupen arrived as soon as he received the telegram” to initiate his battle against fratricide. No wonder, his U.S.-based son Tez Hazarika’s initial comments on hearing that Bharat Ratna was conferred on his father echoed the sentiment: “Awarding Bhupen Hazarika with the Bharat Ratna is a win for humanity, diversity and India as a secular democracy.”The caravan — with the 30 performers in three cars and a jeep — moved from one district to another as the audiences started swelling. Not only the locals (some of whom were engaged in the conflict) joined, but many requested a performance in their localities.“[In] rural areas, especially school students…blocked our path and force us to perform. Such a programme was held in Bokakhat [where girl students] were busy cooking for us,” wrote Biswas in the article on the peace mission. Many even confessed to their mistake.“After the [Nagaon] programme, three students came up to me and confessed with much remorse that they had participated in the riots. One of them was a lead worker of the student federation,” he wrote.In Tezpur and later in Mongoldoi, Assam IPTA’s president and cultural icon Bishnu Prasad Rabha “demonstrated how the [British] colonial rule created a division and rift between different ethnic and linguistic groups” and the post-independence Congress government continued the “legacy forward.”Interestingly, it was the Congress government which arranged for the peace tour after the caravan’s maiden performance in Shillong, realising that the Assamese-Bengali conflict was spiralling out of control.“Bhupen and I got an invitation from the Chief Minister [Bimala Prasad Chaliha] and administrative responsibilities were delegated to Home Minister Fakhruddin Ali Saheb (later President of India),” noted Biswas.Hazarika noted in an essay that the Chief Minister confessed that he had “lost the battle” against linguistic nationalists. “You do whatever you can. Killings are rising with each passing day,” Chaliha told Hazarika. Then Home Minister Ahmed promised “everything” to make the peace caravan a success.“After so much of travelling we, the members of the Let Us Meet cultural troupe — who hardly used to know each other in the beginning – became one unit, a family,” Hazarika says in the film.Ms. Biswas plans to bring out, by next summer, a book containing short memoirs of Hazarika and Biswas, their letters, the songs and poems performed on the tour and small essays by them on each other. “Perhaps this is the most fitting time to revisit their works as the situation is appearing to be more complex than ever in Assam,” she said.At Nagaon, one of worst riot-hit areas, as Hemangoda and Bhupenda came down the stage, with arms around each other, many people started cryingRuby HazarikaMember of the 1960 caravan"

Ex-President of Ivory Coast was acquitted by the ICC
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Belgium said on Saturday that it has agreed to host Ivory Coast ex-President Laurent Gbagbo pending a possible appeal against his acquittal by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity.On January 15, the tribunal acquitted Mr. Gbagbo and his aide, Charles Blé Goudé, on charges stemming from a wave of violence after disputed elections in the West African nation in 2010.The following day, the court ruled that there were no exceptional circumstances preventing the pair’s release from detention in The Hague, and said they could be sent to a member country willing to accept them. “In response to a request from the International Criminal Court, Belgium has agreed to take in Laurent Gbagbo,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Karl Lagatie said, also citing the 73-year-old ex-leader’s “family ties” to the country.Prosecutors can still appeal the January 15 acquittal, but said in a statement on Friday that they was awaiting the court’s written judgment before deciding how to proceed.Mr. Blé Goudé’s lawyer said on Saturday that his client was still “waiting” on a host country to declare itself willing to take him in.Mr. Gbagbo and Mr. Blé Goudé went on trial in January 2016, accused of playing a role in murder, rape, persecution, and other inhumane acts during the post-election violence. More than 3,000 people died on both sides of the Ivory Coast conflict after Mr. Gbagbo refused to concede defeat to his internationally backed-rival — and now-President — Alassane Ouattara."

The Trinamool government does not touch a project unless there is a syndicate involved in it or they have no opting of receiving a kickback; this is an anti-development government,” Mr. Modi said.“Every child knows that there is a thing called triple T in Bengal —Trinamool Tolabaji Tax— which every job aspirant has to pay,” Mr. Modi said at a rally in Durgapur in Bardhhaman district.Tolabajiis colloquial Bengali for extortion.Without naming Ms. Banerjee, the Prime Minister said all forms of extortion or kickbacks “reach one door” indicating that the Trinamool chief is involved in running the networks. He further added that Ms. Banerjee was now “scared”.“She is trying to stop the investigating agencies from coming to Bengal. Why are you worried,Didi, if you have not committed any crime,” Mr. Modi said recalling CBI action against him during the UPA regime.He also criticised the united Opposition for its assembly in Kolkata on January 19, arguing that they came to Kolkata to “hide their crimes”.“But your teaseller will expose each and every one of them,” he said.Earlier, addressing a rally at Thakurnagar in North 24 Paraganas district, Mr. Modi asked the Trinamool “to support the [Citizenship Amendment] Bill” in the Rajya Sabha."

A montage of visceral images recreating the 1984 pogrom ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Beginning with the prime minister’s assassination, Radhika Oberoi’s slim debut novelStillborn Seasonquickly throws the reader in the midst of the mayhem, the fear, and the uncertainty of the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom. I had to pause between the chapters to catch my breath.To sum it up in one line, the novel is about a young witness, Amrit, who grows up to be a journalist. But the novel is much, much more than that. Oberoi lets the Delhi of those turbulent days invade the novel, bringing in a host of characters who are beyond stereotypes, and interweaving a not-much-discussed side of those violent days — the poignant stories of survival and of people saving each other. So the novel is as much about Delhi. In a span of 202 pages, Oberoi brings to life a textured city whose inhabitants connect with each other through blood, neighbourhood ties and the chain of events.Each chapter is a different point of view. Each character has a language — from baby talk, neighbourhood gossip, beggar-speak, taxi-driver speak, ghost tones, to the cuss-word-laden North Indian vocabulary of the hired rioters and policemen. Each linguistic register reveals inner lives and personalities. The brilliant narration is a montage of small and big dramatic moments, sharp and visceral images, and symbols that linger in the mind long after the book is closed.Most of what has been written about the anti-Sikh pogrom over the last 35 years is either broad-brushstroke rage and rhetoric, pedantic information, or literal reportage. Oberoi breaks this mould by making Amrit a journalist seeking human stories beyond the clichés. Through her search, Oberoi takes a fresh and intimate look at the violence. The novel proves that fiction can do what non-fiction cannot — tell a thousand untold stories in a way that makes the violence more real, and so indict it more sharply.The writer is working on a non-fiction book on Punjab.Stillborn Season;Radhika Oberoi,Speaking Tiger,₹350"

Arilova and Kancharapalem among hotspots in the city
",,"With brutal killing of rowdy-sheeter Mohammed Khasim on August 2, 2018, gang wars once again came to light in the city. To control them, rowdy-sheeter Merugu Chittibabu alias Chittimamu, who runs a gang, was booked under PD Act and murder case, and put behind the bars. Supporters of rowdy-sheeter Anil as well as Khasim, who ran another gang, were told to move out of the city. The police are leaving no stone unturned to control the gang wars in the city and have increased their vigil on the movement of the rowdy-sheeters. And the prime reason behind is the increasing number of rowdy-sheeters in the city.According to police records, there are about 450 rowdy-sheeters spread across various areas, including Arilova, Kancharapalem, Gajuwaka and various other police station limits in Visakhapatnam city, in which about 120 are said to be active.In the last four years, there were at least 10 murders, which were fallout of inter-gang rivalry.Fatal attraction“Fascination over the gang culture, lack of proper parental counselling, peer group influence, many youths have been associating themselves with gangs. They join in some local rowdy-sheeter gangs and involve in crime,” said a senior police officer from the city. According to him, in the active 120 rowdy-sheeters, almost half of them are youngsters and school or college dropouts.Police say that while some work under rowdy-sheeters, a few commit crimes in a fit of rage and most of them are unaware of the consequences and spoil their future. Police also fear that these gangs may engage youngsters in the ongoing revenge attacksCounselling conductedA couple of days ago, the City Task Force (CTF) police had conducted counselling programmes to a number of rowdy-sheeters for a span of three days.“After the Khasim’s murder last year, we want to make sure that there are no more revenge attacks. So all the active rowdy-sheeters were summoned and counselled. We asked them to lead a peaceful life after taking up some occupation. We also warned of strict action, if they indulge in any crime further,” said Mahendra Mathe, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP-CTF), speaking toThe Hindu.The ACP also said that additional surveillance is being kept on the rowdy-sheeters and their activities are being monitored by the Police Department to prevent further outbreaks of violence in the city."

Anna Fox, whose work will be on display at the Chennai Photo Biennale, goes beyond the bizarre and exotic to focus on the mundane
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When Anna Fox first set out with her camera, she began with very ordinary subject matters: shopping, leisure time, office life. “I wanted to break the mould of documentary photography, and chose to photograph the ordinary and the everyday; things that were appearing as opposed to disappearing. I’m very interested in women’s lives, rural life, and the power of carnival/local ritual,” says the British photographer.This led to work like theCountry Girlsseries, made in collaboration with singer/songwriter Alison Goldfrapp, which will be on display at the Chennai Photo Biennale later this month. The highly-charged colour photographs, she says, “narrate dark tales from the problem of violence against women in the rural South of England. It was a response to our experiences of growing up in the countryside in the late 1970s”. The images are designed deliberately to be part disconcerting (Gothic fairytale style) and part glamourous (Vogue1970s style), she explains.India callingHow does she think a largely conservative Indian viewer would react to something as stark as her work? “It is always the case that some will like the work while others will not. I expect some people might find it disconcerting; this is because it is disconcerting,” she says. It is not unfamiliar territory for Fox, who has been a regular visitor to the country since 2006 (although her first trip here was in 1984).“I’m working collaboratively with artist Chinar Shah to make a major project on women’s lives in India, which we hope to publish by 2021. I also teach and consult here at NID, Shristi School of Art, Design and Technology, and at The One School, Goa. I love the photography world here, it is friendly and the photographers are creating amazing work,” she smiles, adding that she particularly loves the work of Dyanita Singh, Sunil Gupta and Gauri Gill.Girl powerFox first used a “decent camera” when she was 14 years old, thanks to her father, a keen amateur photographer who encouraged her to use his cameras and learn how to print in his darkroom. “I was inspired by books by Brassaï, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Eugène Atget. The way photography gave you access to interesting subject and places was exciting. As a woman, I found it incredibly liberating to be able to be saying the things I was saying with photography,” she recalls.Knowing the freedom that comes with being able to express herself through her work, she and mentor Karen Knorr started Fast Forward. They had discussed the shocking lack of visibility for women photographers in the publishing and exhibiting worlds. The project started in 2014 with a panel discussion at Tate Modern, and focusses on showcasing the best of emerging and established photography by women from across the world (see box). “We hope to train women further in networking skills as well as in building confidence — the photography skills are all there,” she says.Once she wraps up her work at CPB, Fox is off on a road trip with two other women, a curator and a photographer. “We will end up at the Kochi Biennale. Then I go to China for my two-person show,Another Way of Tellingwith Karen Knorr at OCAT in Xi’An,” she says, after which she heads back to her students at the University for the Creative Arts.

Goyal bumps up revised budget for Rashtriya Gokul Mission, slashes it for 2019-20

Budget documents reveal that the DAHD only managed to spend Rs. 187.73 crore under the scheme in 2017-18.‘Superior’ breedsA DAHD note said, “The RGM was launched in December 2014 on an outlay of Rs. 500 crore (2014-15 to 2016-2017) for developing and conserving indigenous breeds through selective breeding and genetically upgrading ‘nondescript’ bovine population.”Officially, the RGM aims to develop ‘Gokul Gram’ cattle care centres for indigenous breeds of high “genetic merit” as well as breeds that aren’t as gifted. The objective is to get native breeds to produce more milk, be more fecund, and to raise the quality of Indian cows and bulls to eventually outpace Jerseys and Holsteins. The RGM doesn’t address the issue of cattle past their reproductive or useful age. The government, in 2017, banned cattle slaughter, making it difficult for farmers to send away aged cattle.

Three books that will take you on a journey of struggle, surviving ordeals, and emerging stronger...
",,"You cannot open a book without learning something.~ ConfuciusHere are three books that will take you on a wondrous journey of hope, living through struggle, and not giving up. The first isThe Skylarks’ Warby Hilary Macay, a tale of lives overshadowed by the First World War and saved by family and friendship. Brought up in a strict London house in the haphazard care of a father, who is mostly absent, and a short-tempered housekeeper, Peter and Clarry long for summer, every year, when they can escape to their grandparents house in Cornwall, where, along with their kind cousin Rupert, they get a taste of freedom, mutual kindness and understanding. However, things change when Peter is sent to boarding school and Clary is left at home. When the Great War breaks out, Rupert goes off to fight, and it seems that their lives will be changed forever. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Will the family make it through this hellish war?Surviving an ordealImagine you are an independent, young girl, yet, the odds are constantly against you, no matter how strongly you fight back? That is exactly how nine-year-old Cassie Logan feels. Mildred D. Taylor’s book,Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cryis set in Mississippi at the height of the The Great Depression. Cassie and her family are traumatised by the inequality and racism in their small Mississippi town. She is proud of her heritage after learning how her grandfather worked hard to acquire his own land. She knows that her family, by virtue of being black, must work doubly hard to make their tax and mortgage payments. Trouble arrives in the form of a wealthy businessman who wants their land, and sets in motion a series of events to accomplish his ends. Soon, the family is caught in a whirlpool of violence and hatred — a family is threatened by a white neighbour, a mob threatens people, and children are whipped by teachers and parents. It is in the midst of such struggle that young Cassie also discovers why it is important to have land of one’s own and she manages to draw strength from her own self-respect and deal with the horrific goings-on around her.Fighting for rightsBetty Before Xby Ilyasah Shabazz and Renée Watson is a vivid portrait of Betty Shabazz, civil rights activist and wife of Malcolm X. It focuses on Betty Shabazz, during her middle-school years in Detroit, where she lives with her abusive mother, Ollie Mae, her stepfather and several siblings. She loves music, candy, her friends and siblings. Life however, takes a turn for the worse when she is brutally whipped by her mother. She is saved and taken in by Helen and Lorenzo Malloy. Helen is the leader of the Housewives’ League, and it urges women to boycott stores that don’t hire or respect black people. Lorenzo is a businessman. They try to shield Betty from the ugly realities of racism, even as they teach her to stand up and combat injustice."

Anna Fox, whose work will be on display at the Chennai Photo Biennale 2019, goes beyond the bizarre and exotic to focus on the mundane
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When Anna Fox first set out with her camera, she began with very ordinary subject matters: shopping, leisure time, office life. “I wanted to break the mould of documentary photography, and chose to photograph the ordinary and the everyday; things that were appearing as opposed to disappearing. I’m very interested in women’s lives, rural life, and the power of carnival/local ritual,” says the British photographer.Rising starsChinar Shah (India)is making powerful social comments about Indian life today; she is not afraid of confronting her audience. Her photography is bold and frequently surprisingNatasha Caruana (UK)makes work about modern love. For the project,Married Man,she dated over 80 men who had advertised as married men wanting mistresses.Marilene Ribeiro (Brazil)breaks the boundaries of traditional documentary photography by collaborating with her subjects and getting them to actively take part in the storytelling. Her current work,Dead Water,looks at three hydroelectric projects in Brazil, and the way these have changed the lives of the people who live near them.Maria Kapajeva (Estonia/UK)uses photography, video and textiles to make work about cultural identity and gender, with an emphasis on revealing forgotten stories. She works with histories that grow out of a collection of vernacular photography that she finds in archives, old family albums, on the Internet or in flea markets.This led to work like theCountry Girlsseries, made in collaboration with singer/songwriter Alison Goldfrapp, which will be on display at the Chennai Photo Biennale later this month. The highly-charged colour photographs, she says, “narrate dark tales from the problem of violence against women in the rural South of England. It was a response to our experiences of growing up in the countryside in the late 1970s”. The images are designed deliberately to be part disconcerting (Gothic fairytale style) and part glamourous (Vogue1970s style), she explains.India callingHow does she think a largely conservative Indian viewer would react to something as stark as her work? “It is always the case that some will like the work while others will not. I expect some people might find it disconcerting; this is because it is disconcerting,” she says. It is not unfamiliar territory for Fox, who has been a regular visitor to the country since 2006 (although her first trip here was in 1984).“I’m working collaboratively with artist Chinar Shah to make a major project on women’s lives in India, which we hope to publish by 2021. I also teach and consult here at NID, Shristi School of Art, Design and Technology, and at The One School, Goa. I love the photography world here, it is friendly and the photographers are creating amazing work,” she smiles, adding that she particularly loves the work of Dyanita Singh, Sunil Gupta and Gauri Gill.“As a woman, I found it incredibly liberating to be able to be saying the things I was saying with photography,” says Anna Fox
 
| Photo Credit:Special ArrangementGirl powerFox first used a “decent camera” when she was 14 years old, thanks to her father, a keen amateur photographer who encouraged her to use his cameras and learn how to print in his darkroom. “I was inspired by books by Brassaï, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Eugène Atget. The way photography gave you access to interesting subject and places was exciting. As a woman, I found it incredibly liberating to be able to be saying the things I was saying with photography,” she recalls.Knowing the freedom that comes with being able to express herself through her work, she and mentor Karen Knorr started Fast Forward. They had discussed the shocking lack of visibility for women photographers in the publishing and exhibiting worlds. The project started in 2014 with a panel discussion at Tate Modern, and focusses on showcasing the best of emerging and established photography by women from across the world (see box). “We hope to train women further in networking skills as well as in building confidence — the photography skills are all there,” she says.In November/December 2019, Tate Modern in London, along with Fast Forward, will host an international conference titled ‘How Do Women Work’. The call for papers is open till March 1. To participate, e-mail a 500 word abstract and CV or your webpage link to[email protected](Details: fastforward.photography)Once she wraps up her work at CPB, Fox is off on a road trip with two other women, a curator and a photographer. “We will end up at the Kochi Biennale. Then I go to China for my two-person show,Another Way of Tellingwith Karen Knorr at OCAT in Xi’An,” she says, after which she heads back to her students at the University for the Creative Arts.

A sweet story that shines more because January’s releases have been so awful ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The year has just begun but January is already staking a claim to being the cruellest month for Hindi cinema. Propaganda, jingoism and parochialism; aggression, conflicts and attacks; latent hostility and outright hatred — there’s a lot of negativity on screen in the overblown hagiographies and obsequious recreations of events from the recent past.It has taken a bunch of children in a Marathi film calledDhappato change the overriding narrative of belligerence and sectarianism, and underscore the spirit of camaraderie, inclusivity and harmony. The adults may have lost the plot but the kids are certainly alright.Winner of the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration,Dhappahas been directed by Nipun Avinash Dharmadhikari and co-produced by two of the finest talents in Marathi cinema, filmmaker Umesh Kulkarni and actor Girish Kulkarni, who has also written the story and screenplay, inspired from a true incident.The children inDhappadon’t just feel real but Girish also makes their views shine through; and pivots the film on their perspective. “In India, we hardly have any films where children actually feel like children. It’s like the point-of-view of a grown-up has been imposed on the child’s psyche,” says Umesh.Girish has managed the near impossible: he has penned a children’s film that steers clear of moral grandstanding and doesn’t talk down to them. It’s about children going on a journey of self-discovery all by themselves. In one of the film’s most resonating scenes, the father of a physically challenged child approves of him getting out of his bubble to confront the ugliness in the world. How else will he be able to test his own mettle?Sweet and simple‘Dhappa’ kicks off with delightful little childhood vignettes — the banter and bickering in the autorickshaw ride from school, the silly fights with the apartment grinch, playing cupid to a couple of lovestruck youngsters, and evading the clutches of the overzealous grandmother.Dhappafeels like a straight, sweet and simple slice of middle-class life, the kind we associate with the cinema of Sai Paranjape, Basu Chatterjee and Hrishikesh Mukherjee.In fact, it seems as though there isn’t much else going on, until the apartment complex decides to stage a play on environment issues for Ganesh Chaturthi. A drama on trees that walk, a monkey that talks, and time-travel, it brings together Jesus Christ and Sant Tukaram as they break bread and bhaakri on stage, while chiding human beings for reducing earth to a disaster zone. The play riles the local politician/ goon, Bhau, who can’t digest the blurring of religious and cultural boundaries. The only way he can retort is through force and violence.How will the children counter him?Dhappamay feel sentimental and cute in turns but it certainly isn’t shorn of profundity. “You need a child’s mind to understand complex issues,” says Umesh. It’s why the youngsters don’t find anything offensive about Christ being a part of the Ganesh festival.The film is about the urgency to return to the simplicity and innocence of a child. Caste, class, and religious disparities may be all around but the children are able to rise above it all. They are the ones who hold a candle for tolerance. Therein lies much-needed subtlety and nuance.The writer is Associate Editor-Cinema withThe Hinduin Mumbai."

“Two Fathers” brings the larger than life image of Einstein and Gandhi into our tiny worlds with the thread of domestic challenges that resonate widely
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"One can only wonder what a meeting between Gandhi and Einstein could have been like. Two of the most influential personalities of the 20th century, they both had immense admiration for each other but never had the opportunity to meet. Exploring this idea, playwright Sundar Sarukkai weaves an alternate universe of compelling rendezvous between the two great men and their children inTwo Fathers.One would easily imagine Gandhi and Einstein in a profound conversation hinged on physics, metaphysics and politics. Instead, the script cobbles together a more challenging, subtle and emotional exchange. The two icons share the pain of parenting that remains largely unarticulated in the overarching narrative of their achievements and contributions to the world. With passing references to world history, the dialogues remain focused on their personal histories as fathers who constantly struggled in the role of a parent. While Gandhi’s troubled relationship with his eldest son Harilal is common knowledge, Einstein never acknowledged Lieserl as his daughter since she was born out of wedlock. The play brings together these four characters in direct conversation that circumvents the obvious and engages in a deeply personal yet powerfully universal theme of parent-child relationships.Script and stageMinimalism is used as a potent theatrical trope in the play, yet at points it also lapses into visual monotony. High fidelity to the text props up the script with its nuanced characterisation and clever dialogues, yet it also means diminished stage action. The plot does not have much to look out for, the core remains the expression of emotional lives. The play is pointedly pinned on the textual rather than visual aspects.For director Srinivas Bhashyam, the choice of frugal stagecraft was pivotal, “I was fascinated by the concept and did not want to artificially infuse action into the play.” An acclaimed film director, Bhashyam returns to theatre with this production after a long time. As opposed to the cinematic spectacle, he found value in putting the spotlight on the core of theatre with very raw, bare sets and simplicity. Focusing on performance and script, he wanted the production to remain true to idea and emotion.Even though the directorial vision does not offer a visual spectacle, there are moments in the play that make immensely powerful images paired with crisp one-liners. For instance, Einstein attempting to spin the charkha exclaims, “Why do you spin so much when you wear so little!” Another moving moment is Gandhi gazing at his own photograph in Einstein’s study, speculating that “I couldn’t have been Professor Gandhi because I never said anything new.”The scenography remains unchanged with the stage divided into Gandhi’s ashram (depicted with the charkha) and Einstein’s study (with a desk and blackboard). Similarly, the music (by Rowan Serrao) is used very sparingly, featuringAir- Einstein’s favourite composition of Bach, and Gandhi’s quintessential bhajan-Vaishnava jan to.The script takes centre-stage, with emotive twists as a curious Einstein attempts to justify Gandhi’s position to his son Harilal, while an empathetic Gandhi tries to assuage Lieserl’s bitterness. Through the two interactions, the play invites the audience to examine their own family relationships, aptly pointing out that this is a story of ‘extraordinary men who were ordinary fathers.’From icons to menThe Professor and the Mahatma are daunting characters to play. The task became a greater challenge with the lack of English-speaking actors in Goa. Bhashyam recalls several frustrating auditions where a good actor was unable to speak fluent English or refused to shave his head for the role of Gandhi.Finally Bhashyam himself took on the role, though he says, “I am amused that people think I can act, my physical appearance resembled the role and since there was no other actor I came in, but my ambitions lie in direction.” He adopted the distinct declamatory style to project Gandhi which seems somewhat patchy with the other three actors’ realistic dialogue delivery.Sheeba Shah shines as the disgruntled daughter of Einstein, whom she never came to know as a father. The narrative and performances build a unique and nuanced relationship between Gandhi and ‘beti’ Lieserl as he identifies his own mistakes as a father while listening to her resentment for Einstein.Varun Kainth plays Einstein with ease. He talks to the audience as a confidante, sporting a convincing accent and alternating between being amusing and candid. Valentino Dias interprets the character of Harilal with tenderness. He unravels numerous layers, presenting a spectrum of vivid emotions from being the angry black sheep of the family, to secretly aching for his father’s approval.Posterity and possibilityThe unobtrusive lighting by Tarosh Rao highlights the final imaginary meeting between the two great men as they enter an empty spotlight in the final scene. The conversation touches upon everything they possibly could have chatted about— non-violence, the war, the bomb, the moral burden of the disasters of the last century and the nature of truth.“Two Fathers” may not be an enthralling watch, but it is engaging and makes one think. It brings the larger than life image of Einstein and Gandhi into our tiny worlds with the thread of domestic challenges that resonate widely. The play finally rests upon little truths of everyday life that ‘great minds never see.’"
"What did you achieve by killing Araku MLA, CM asks Maoists",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/what-did-you-achieve-by-killing-araku-mla-cm-asks-maoists/article26143105.ece,,,"Strongly condemning the assassination of Araku MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and his close aide and former MLA Siveri Soma, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday said such incidents were against the spirit of democracy and their actions were by no means justifiable.The Maoists could differ on issues but they absolutely had no right to eliminate people’s representatives.Asking what the Maoists achieved by killing the MLA and his follower, Mr. Naidu appealed to them not to endanger democracy by resorting to violence.Moving a condolence motion in the Assembly on the two deaths, Mr. Naidu said it was unfortunate that the Maoists had suspected the MLA of encouraging bauxite mining in Visakhapatnam district even after the TDP government had not only cancelled the mining leases given to the NMDC Limited but also imposed a blanket ban on the extraction of the ore. He alleged that it was the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy government which created the mess by allowing the mining against the wishes of the tribal folks.‘Blow to development’Minister Kidari Shravan Kumar, elder son of the slain MLA, asked whether it was fair on the part of the Maoists to kill his father who dedicated his life to the welfare of the tribal people.He recalled that Sarveswara Rao had vowed at a public meeting in his constituency in 2015 to quit politics if the mining resumed. He observed that by killing leaders like his father, the Maoists had dealt a severe blow to the development of tribal areas. Speaker Kodela Siva Prasada Rao said the killings had exposed the hollowness of the Maoists’ claims to fight for the rights of the tribal people. Paderu MLA Giddi Eswari said the people’s representatives in the agency areas had been living under constant fear and insisted that the government should do something to improve the situation. TDP chief whip Palle Raghunatha Reddy appealed to the Naxalites to join the mainstream by realising the futility of their armed revolt.BJP Floor leader P. Vishnu Kumar Raju said Maoists should use vote as a bullet and contest in the elections to implement their agenda through democratic means."

We need to teach the lessons of the Holocaust, to be more respectful towards others, says Israel’s Consul General in Mumbai
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On January 27, Jews in India joined the world in observing the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. On this day in 1945, Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest concentration camp in Poland, was liberated by the Red Army. More than 70 years later, the Holocaust endures as a grim reminder of the intolerance that continues to exist in society. Israel’s Consul General in Mumbai Yaakov Finkelstein talks withThe Hinduabout the lessons we need to learn from the Holocaust, and the deepening ties between India and Israel.Why is the remembrance of the Holocaust relevant today?We view the Holocaust as a unique event in the history of humankind. It was an organised massacre of people by a government. Of course, there have been other genocides and atrocities. The Holocaust was Jewish but the message is universal in terms of phobia, intolerance, racism and anti-Semitism.It is important to remember the Holocaust because the world has not learned the lessons yet. We see the repetition of atrocities against minorities, lack of tolerance and lots of violence. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe. We need to teach the lessons of the Holocaust, to be more respectful and tolerant towards others.How relevant is it for India?India has been a good example with lack of anti-Semitism, historically. But intolerance is intolerance. It can be against Jews, other religious minorities, it can be your colour, gender or political views. We have to educate people to be more tolerant. Even if there is one person who is intolerant, he can harm someone because of that and we need to get that one person educated.Time and again, we hear stories about the Holocaust being unreal. Why does such an argument exist?Holocaust denial is yet another aspect or face of intolerance and racism. People live in denial. In order to solve a problem, the first step is to recognise it and acknowledge it. We still have survivors, who are living testimonies to the atrocities. Not only Jews, but there are also Germans, American soldiers, citizens of Poland who can testify to the existence of the Holocaust. How can one deny such a huge scale phenomenon? We have to fight this form of intolerance too as it can be dangerous as more people start believing in it.India-Israel relations have entered the 27th year. What are the key collaborations between the two countries?It is a great milestone for us. We have managed to create a strategic bond that will extend beyond governments and exist for a long time. The bond is based on the fundamental needs and interests of both countries.We have collaborations in the fields of agriculture, water, high-tech, cyber and fin-tech. We are getting the Israeli know-how in irrigation systems by setting up centres of excellence in various parts of India. We have also launched Israeli satellites on Indian launchers. So, from the grass roots to space, we have cooperation everywhere.There is a growing number of tourists from India visiting Israel. After starting a direct flight to Tel Aviv in 2018, we had 80,000 tourists, which was double the number from the previous year. Our largest foreign community of students is Indians. We are now looking at more Indian movies being shot in Israel.How do you plan to attract Bollywood?There are advantages of Israel being a small country. In close proximity, you can have the mountains, forest, beaches, the Dead Sea and the deserts. Within an hour’s drive, you can change the location. Also, there are great technical skills of people who know to make cinema.

BJP questions the role of State’s CEO, seeks supervisor from elsewhere
",,"All major political parties in the Opposition in West Bengal met the full bench of the Election Commission in Kolkata on Thursday and demanded that Central Armed Police Forces be deployed in all polling booths of the State during the Lok Sabha elections.Rural poll violenceRepresentatives of the BJP, Left parties including the CPI(M), and the Congress all brought up references to the widespread violence during the panchayat polls in the State last year and demanded deployment of the CAPF before the EC delegation led by Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora.“The entire State [should] be declared critical and vulnerable and hence let CAPF be deployed in all polling stations and the villages or localities they serve,” a letter submitted by senior BJP leaders including Mukul Roy said.The State BJP delegation also raised questions on the role of the State’s Chief Electoral Officer and demanded that the EC appoint a senior IAS officer from other State to supervise the functioning of the West Bengal CEO. The BJP also demanded that all general observers should be empowered to review the functioning of district election officers and returning officers.A West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee delegation that included vice president Maya Ghosh demanded that Central forces be mobilised a month before the elections so that voters can feel secure about attending campaigns of the Opposition parties.CPI(M) leader Rabin Deb told the EC bench that only deployment of the CAPF is not enough. “We have seen in the last few elections that Central forces are not being deployed properly and are confined to the barracks; therefore it is necessary that they be deployed during the polling process,” Mr. Deb said.From the ruling Trinamool Congress, party leader and West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee met the EC representatives. However, Mr. Chatterjee did not speak to journalists on what transpired in the meeting.The ECI’s full bench has been in West Bengal since Wednesday to assess preparedness for the Lok Sabha elections in the State."
Holocaust denial is a form of intolerance: Israel’s Consul General in Mumbai Yaakov Finkelstein,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/holocaust-denial-is-a-form-of-intolerance/article26143070.ece,"
We need to teach the lessons of the Holocaust, to be more respectful towards others, says Israel’s Consul General in Mumbai Yaakov Finkelstein ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On January 27, Jews in India joined the world in observing the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. On this day in 1945, Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest concentration camp in Poland, was liberated by the Red Army. More than 70 years later, the Holocaust endures as a grim reminder of the intolerance that continues to exist in society. Israel’s Consul General in Mumbai Yaakov Finkelstein talks withThe Hinduabout the lessons we need to learn from the Holocaust, and the deepening ties between India and Israel.Why is the remembrance of the Holocaust relevant today?We view the Holocaust as a unique event in the history of humankind. It was an organised massacre of people by a government. Of course, there have been other genocides and atrocities. The Holocaust was Jewish but the message is universal in terms of phobia, intolerance, racism and anti-Semitism.It is important to remember the Holocaust because the world has not learned the lessons yet. We see the repetition of atrocities against minorities, lack of tolerance and lots of violence. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe. We need to teach the lessons of the Holocaust, to be more respectful and tolerant towards others.How relevant is it for India?India has been a good example with lack of anti-Semitism, historically. But intolerance is intolerance. It can be against Jews, other religious minorities, it can be your colour, gender or political views. We have to educate people to be more tolerant. Even if there is one person who is intolerant, he can harm someone because of that and we need to get that one person educated.Time and again, we hear stories about the Holocaust being unreal. Why does such an argument exist?Holocaust denial is yet another aspect or face of intolerance and racism. People live in denial. In order to solve a problem, the first step is to recognise it and acknowledge it. We still have survivors, who are living testimonies to the atrocities. Not only Jews, but there are also Germans, American soldiers, citizens of Poland who can testify to the existence of the Holocaust. How can one deny such a huge scale phenomenon? We have to fight this form of intolerance too as it can be dangerous as more people start believing in it.India-Israel relations have entered the 27th year. What are the key collaborations between the two countries?It is a great milestone for us. We have managed to create a strategic bond that will extend beyond governments and exist for a long time. The bond is based on the fundamental needs and interests of both countries.We have collaborations in the fields of agriculture, water, high-tech, cyber and fin-tech. We are getting the Israeli know-how in irrigation systems by setting up centres of excellence in various parts of India. We have also launched Israeli satellites on Indian launchers. So, from the grass roots to space, we have cooperation everywhere.There is a growing number of tourists from India visiting Israel. After starting a direct flight to Tel Aviv in 2018, we had 80,000 tourists, which was double the number from the previous year. Our largest foreign community of students is Indians. We are now looking at more Indian movies being shot in Israel.How do you plan to attract Bollywood?There are advantages of Israel being a small country. In close proximity, you can have the mountains, forest, beaches, the Dead Sea and the deserts. Within an hour’s drive, you can change the location. Also, there are great technical skills of people who know to make cinema. Thus, assistance on the ground, manpower, equipment etc. can be found there easily."

Isaac cautions against vested interests attempting to destroy unity and amity of State
",,"Social, political and financial issues that triggered intense and serious debates on gender equality, the need for conserving renaissance values and federal principles of late have resonated in the State Budget.Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, in his budget for 2019-20 , cautioned against vested interests attempting to destroy the unity and amity among people that helped overcome the travails of the flood and also how they saw the implementation of the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala as a golden opportunity for communal polarisation.“The determined efforts to unleash violence on the street was an attempt to sabotage renaissance values of Kerala,” he said. But it also proved to be an opportunity for an introspection on how Kerala had failed to pursue such values. It culminated in a pledge to remain steadfast to such values and the women’s wall was its outcome.The wall was a declaration that Kerala would not compromise on such values and also on gender equality and allied issues, Dr. Isaac said and announced that the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi will create similar walls to immortalise the memories of the historical movement.Social reformers’ roleReminiscing the teachings of Sree Narayana Guru, Dr. Isaac said that his words “whatever be the religion, attire or language, their caste is one” are quite relevant at present. He also quoted Kumaran Asan’s `Simhanadam’ to point to the ongoing discussions on purity and impurity and untouchability.The Minister also hailed the contributions of social reformers such as Fr. Chavara, Ayyankali, Mannath Padmanabhan and Makti Thangal in establishing schools and creating an awareness about the need for education.He also reiterated that the government was committed to protecting the temples, developing Sabarimala, resting centres en route and also roads leading to the temple."

Three books that will take you on a journey of struggle, surviving ordeals, and emerging stronger...
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"You cannot open a book without learning something.~ ConfuciusHere are three books that will take you on a wondrous journey of hope, living through struggle, and not giving up. The first isThe Skylarks’ Warby Hilary Macay, a tale of lives overshadowed by the First World War and saved by family and friendship. Brought up in a strict London house in the haphazard care of a father, who is mostly absent, and a short-tempered housekeeper, Peter and Clarry long for summer, every year, when they can escape to their grandparents house in Cornwall, where, along with their kind cousin Rupert, they get a taste of freedom, mutual kindness and understanding. However, things change when Peter is sent to boarding school and Clary is left at home. When the Great War breaks out, Rupert goes off to fight, and it seems that their lives will be changed forever. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Will the family make it through this hellish war?Surviving an ordealImagine you are an independent, young girl, yet, the odds are constantly against you, no matter how strongly you fight back? That is exactly how nine-year-old Cassie Logan feels. Mildred D. Taylor’s book,Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cryis set in Mississippi at the height of the The Great Depression. Cassie and her family are traumatised by the inequality and racism in their small Mississippi town. She is proud of her heritage after learning how her grandfather worked hard to acquire his own land. She knows that her family, by virtue of being black, must work doubly hard to make their tax and mortgage payments. Trouble arrives in the form of a wealthy businessman who wants their land, and sets in motion a series of events to accomplish his ends. Soon, the family is caught in a whirlpool of violence and hatred — a family is threatened by a white neighbour, a mob threatens people, and children are whipped by teachers and parents. It is in the midst of such struggle that young Cassie also discovers why it is important to have land of one’s own and she manages to draw strength from her own self-respect and deal with the horrific goings-on around her.Fighting for rightsBetty Before Xby Ilyasah Shabazz and Renée Watson is a vivid portrait of Betty Shabazz, civil rights activist and wife of Malcolm X. It focuses on Betty Shabazz, during her middle-school years in Detroit, where she lives with her abusive mother, Ollie Mae, her stepfather and several siblings. She loves music, candy, her friends and siblings. Life however, takes a turn for the worse when she is brutally whipped by her mother. She is saved and taken in by Helen and Lorenzo Malloy. Helen is the leader of the Housewives’ League, and it urges women to boycott stores that don’t hire or respect black people. Lorenzo is a businessman. They try to shield Betty from the ugly realities of racism, even as they teach her to stand up and combat injustice."
U.S. tops in West for civil strife,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/us-tops-in-west-for-civil-strife/article26144186.ece,,,"The United States suffers from more civil strife than 17 other Western democracies, according to an official report published here [Washington, January 31]. The National Commission on violence said about 11 out of every 1,000 Americans took part in various forms of civil strife in a five-year period ending last May, resulting in 220 deaths. Comparative studies suggested that since 1963, the U.S. has experienced strife of greater intensity and greater duration than all but few other western democracies, the Commission said. The 13-member study group, appointed to probe the causes of American violence after Senator Robert Kennedy’s assassination last June, said the U.S. ranked sixth among 14 nations in the magnitude of public strife. The Commission’s preliminary findings were submitted to the White House in a progress report on January 9, 11 days before President Johnson retired, but were released for publication only yesterday."
‘Art doesn’t happen in vacuum’,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/art-doesnt-happen-in-vacuum/article26146206.ece,"
If the region that has shaped an art form is constantly in a situation of strife, art gets affected naturally, says Priti Patel, the senior Manipuri dancer
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The lush green premises of Shankaraa Foundation in Bangalore provides an ideal atmosphere for hostingDance Jatre, the annual dance fair by Shambhavi School of Dance. Besides dancers who had gathered to participate in the competitions, the two-day fair mainly catered to the interest of dance enthusiasts eager to explore aspects of dance. The place came alive with dancers walking around the campus in colourful classical dance costumes, awaiting their turn, posing for the camera and more. Competitions, workshops, exhibition and sale of dance jewellery went on simultaneously in different stalls, providing visitors the feel of a ‘jatre’. About 12 workshops in classical, folk and contemporary styles were held in an open air theatre, where even visitors could attend the sessions.Among 16 experts who conducted the workshop on aspects of movement, choreography and rhythm, was Manipuri exponent Priti Patel from Calcutta. Introducing her form to the participants, the recipient of Sangeet Natak Academy award said: “What highlights Manipuri over other classical dance forms of India is its living tradition. Despite the fact that it has evolved to become a stage art, its practice as a form of worship in religious spaces and ceremonies in Manipur has not ceased to this day.”Continuing her conversation withThe Hinduafter the brief morning session, she adds, “on the flip-side, it becomes challenging for a choreographer to bring these ritualistic and deeply spiritual aspects onto stage that is bereft of the deity, devotees and aura of the temple.” Moreover, it entrusts immense responsibility on the practitioner in selecting suitable aspects while leaving out the rest. Volatile matters according to her should not be presented on the proscenium as it would cause further friction in conflict zones like Manipur. On how to decide what to include and what not, Patel explains, “gurus show us the path. Beyond that, a dancer’s experience in the art form will guide her.”Priti Patel fine-tuned her art and took it to newer heights under the influence of acclaimed Manipuri writer Rajakumari Binodini Devi (whose 97th birth anniversary is next week). It was through ‘Imashi’, as she used to call her, Patel was introduced to customs and beliefs of Manipuri. “I absorbed a lot from her worldview and my dance would not have looked the same without her nuanced guidance,” explains the senior Manipuri danseuse under whose direction Anjika dance troupe stages its mega productions.Having mastered not onlyRasleelabutThang-ta, martial arts of Manipur andLai Haroba, ritualistic dance in the glory of Manipuri gods, she observes: “Manipuri underwent changes during the advent of the Vaishnavite cult which introduced Sanskrit literature to the art form, however, the technique has remained the same throughout.”“Manipuri might look like a South-east Asian dance form for an uninformed audience, more so because Manipuri dancers have Mongoloid features which gets reflected in their postures. However, its spirit and content is Indian,” she states.Manipur has been under strife throughout and without reflecting on its situation, according to her, is like dancing in vacuum. “One cannot dance without thinking. Dance is region-specific and if the region that has shaped the art form is under constant struggle, art gets affected naturally,” she feels. Patel who has engaged with contemporary scenarios through her art, has centred her productionKhuman: The Black Sun, on the consequences of men resorting to violence. “I dedicated this production to one of my students who lost his life due to the violence in the region,” she recalls.Does art play a role in bringing about peace? “Honestly, I do not know as this does not come under my purview. All I’ve tried to do as an artiste is to send across a message,” she responds.Dance and thought go together. One cannot dance without thinking"
