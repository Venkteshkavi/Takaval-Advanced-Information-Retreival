Chemical-laden colours and gulaal have caused severe allergic reactions in the eyes and skin besides causing breathing difficulties among many people.Several city doctors told TOI that around 70%patients, who came to them on Thursday and Friday, showed reactions to colours and side-effects of bhang.Senior medical officer at J PHospital, Dr Saurabh Jain, said, “Around 900 people came to the OPD during the peak hours of Holi, from 12 pm to 8 pm, out of which more than 30% cases were related to allergies in eyes due to colour and respiratory disorders from inhaling gulaal and other sorts of colours. Many people also came with skin rashes and allergies due to chemical-based colours. Apart from this, around 40-50% cases were related to injuries and accidents caused to due to overconsumption of bhang and alcohol.”He added that about 600 out of 900 patients, who came in during the peak time, were Holi-related cases.Pulmonologist Dr P N Agrawal also said that many people suffering from respiratory problems had congestion in chest and trouble breathing while children suffering from asthma faced severe attacks due to cold water and inhaling powdered colour.“I felt that due to several campaigns related to a safe Holi, the number of Holi-related cases saw a decline as compared to last year, but even then, there were many people who had asthma attacks and had fever after playing Holi with cold water. People suffering from respiratory problems had chest congestion and trouble in breathing and wheezing,” Agrawal added.Dr Lokendra Dave also recounted similar cases and advised people to see the doctor immediately instead of trying home remedies before the infection worsens.“A number of patients try to treat the condition with home remedies, thinking that it is not something major and will go away in a day or two. This kind of lax attitude causes the infections to worsen. Many such cases will reach the hospitals and private doctors in a day or two,” said Dave.Agrawal also advised people suffering from respiratory troubles to drink warm water and go for stream inhalation for relief.Dermatologist Akhilesh Agrawal, who has attended to more than 10 patients since Thursday suffering from skin allergies and rashes caused due to colours, said: “There are no guidelines to make colours and many manufacturers use industrial dye and metals to manufacture colours that cause rashes, redness, irritation and itching on the skin. Besides, people use volatile substances like kerosene, petrol etc to remove the colour which further irritates the affected area. Friction with cloth while rubbing also increases dermatitis,” he said.“Applying petroleum jelly or coconut oil before exposing the skin to colours reduces the level of penetration and can prevent allergies.”“InBhopal, the percentage of people suffering from skin allergies caused due to Holi colours has reduced as people are now more aware and use non-allergic and herbal colours during the festival,” he added."

In most of these platforms — Diaspora, Riot, Riseup.net, Proton mail – users’ rights over their data are intact. In fact, some platforms allow users to edit source code and add a layer of protection to further secure their information.The youngsters are talking about Diaspora, Riot and Riseup at a time whenFacebookis under a fresh attack after it was revealed that the social networking giant knew about Cambridge Analytica using users’ data earlier than what it had claimed.Many of them revealed their preferences on the sidelines of the conference ‘Technology for Democracy’, organized on Saturday in Hyderabad by Swechha, a non-profit organization. They said they were here to raise their voice against what they called the “surveillance economy which is killing democracy”. More than 1,000 people, mostly under 30 years, participated in the event.Millenials of city see data as a resource that needs protectionNaveen C, a third-year engineering student of CMR College of Engineering & Technology says, “no one knows my interests or likes on these platforms and there is no way anyone can influence me by sharing only a particular type of information.”Naveen is critical of sites like Facebook. “It creates a bubble and keeps us in an illusion,” he says. “If I am sensitive towards farmers, I will only get information on schemes related to farmers from a political party and at the end, I will be voting for them even without realising that I was manipulated.”Users on these platforms say decentralization of data is an important factor which is bringing them towards these sites. “Unlike foreign-based companies, data is not placed in one location here. It is decentralised and gives me an option of what to share and who to share it with,” says Maithreie K, a student of Sridevi Women's Engineering College. “No Tom, Dick, and Harry can even create an account in sites like Riseup as it needs an invite from an existing user who is at least three months old on the platform.”Many of them say that the result of 2016 presidential election in the United States, where fake posts and ads on social media platforms were used to sharpen divides between people, and the Cambridge Analytica controversy was a wake-up call for them.“Privacy is the least concern for many classic social media sites. Having access to peoples’ caste, creed and religion, their likes and dislikes and playing on their sentiments can be adverse,” says Sahithi, a techie.These millennials and first-time voters term data as a natural resource and add that soon everyone will realise that it is the most important asset they have that needs protection."

Kumar was awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi high court on December 17, 2018 and is now in jail.Phoolka also released Para 3 of the CBI’s reply, which reads: “The present appeal arises in reference to a ghastly incident that occurred on the morning of 31st October 1984 in Delhi, subsequent to which thousands of Sikhs were brutally murdered and their houses vandalised. The killings had taken place in pursuance to the provocative speeches made by the applicant/convict against the Sikh community. The killing of five innocent Sikhs in this case was not a revengeful act but had taken place due to the hatred disseminated, spread by the applicant, convict against the Sikhs. The brutal murder of innocent Sikhs during the 1984 riots falls under the category of crimes against the humanity on parity with well known genocides worldwide like large scale killing of Armenians by Kurds and Turks, mass extermination of Jews by Nazis, mass killing of Bangladeshi citizens by the sympathizers of Pakistani army and mass killing during various ethnic riots within India also. In this case, the minority community was targeted by the spearheaded attacks of the dominant political actors like the applicant/convict and duly facilitated by the law enforcement agencies. As such, this case has to be viewed in the larger context of mass crimes and requires a different approach than a case of normal murder/ rioting.”Phoolka informed that the bail application of Kumar was now listed before SC for March 25."

They were later put on trial. Vaghela defended himself by claiming that a local Congress leader, Iqbal Shaikh, had been arrested in a case of rioting and therefore to build a balance, police arrested them as Hindu leaders. While acquitting the duo earlier this month by extending benefit of doubt for want of inadequate evidence, additional sessions judge V J Kalotara said that the police chargesheet showed in its Column No. 2 a mob of 2,000 Hindus whose names and addresses were not known. The court observed, “There was a mob of around 2,000 persons in this incident, but only two persons were arrested later. This raises doubt, because it is clearly established that police had reached the spot in time.”The court further said that there were police points set up in all four directions during the post-Godhra riots. Curfew was imposed and policebandobastwas very heavy.“But not a single accused person was arrested and nobody’s name was revealed later. This is not believable,” the court commented and pointed out that there were only 15 witnesses and panch witnesses shown in this case, despite the fact that there were so many police personnel and local people available for testimonies. “This brings the prosecution’s case under the shadow of doubt,” the court added.The court noted that the rioting mob had torched properties belonging to Muslims. But a witness, Mohyuddin Pathan alias Safed Sher, whose house was burnt down, turned hostile. Other independent witnesses were found improvising during deposition and the court found their testimonies contradictory. The panch witnesses too turned hostile. In 2014, Vaghela were acquitted in another rioting case along with 43 others."

He was hit by at least five bullets and died on the spot.Ashbab’s lawyer Nasir Ali told TOI that his client was getting threats and had even complained to police in February. “All the six accused are out on bail now. Ashbab was the key witness in the case, and its next hearing is on March 25. He was being constantly pressured to reach a compromise. Fearing that he would be killed, Ashbab had even approached police in February and filed a complaint,” Ali said.‘For me, the riots are still on’Superintendent of police Satpal Antil said: “The shooters were captured on CCTV cameras. We are screening the footage to identify them.”Reacting to the killing, Ashbab’s father Akhtar, 65, said: “We used to live in Kheri Tagaan village near Mansoorpur town of Muzaffarnagar. We fled after the riots, leaving everything behind. During the riots, two of my sons — Nawab and Shaheed — were murdered and Ashbab was a witness to that. He was under constant threat.”After a brief pause, Akhtar added: “For me the riots are still on.” When asked about the motive, he said: “We have no enmity with anyone. I suspect that this murder is connected to the ongoing trial. They killed my two sons and wanted to compromise. Ashbab never agreed to it.” Police have already filed a chargesheet in the case. However, all the six accused were freed on bail during the course of the trial.KhatauliSHO Harsharan Sharma said: “A case under Section 302 (murder) of theIndian Penal Codehas been registered against unidentified people.”Ashbab was buried on Tuesday after a post-mortem examination.Read the story in Bengali"

How well our friends adapt to our constant evolution and outlook towards life? These are the questions that the sixth show ofTran Aadi Liti, aGujaratiminimalistic and verbose comedydramathat was staged at the Ouroboros Art Hub Blackbox Theatre in Ahmedabad recently evoked among the audience.Directed by Henil Gandhi and written by Keka Mehta, the all-male youth oriented niche play has been adapted for the fun-loving Gujarati audience from a French play titled Art by Yasmin Raza.The first scene opens with a narration of how a painting having only three lines has been bought for `5 crore by Hemang (played by Yash Soni) and has led to a faceoff between him and his childhood friend Aakash (Pratik Rathod) even as their friend Vishal (Kishan Gadhavi) tries to mediate. Vishal tells Hemang that he likes the painting just to make him happy but instead draws wrath from Aakash. The play is a fun take on the lies we tell our friends often putting them in a tight position and the leg-pulling that goes in between along with the remarks on wedding venue that every host family has to hear from relatives even as the bride pronounces a Sabyasachi lehenga assaagbhajilehenga.While Yash is convincing in his role of Hemang as a divorced doctor and a passionate art collector, Pratik’s portrayal of the serious minded no-nonsense attitude role of Aakash makes you wonder about the hero and the anti-hero even as Kishan steals the show as he makes you laugh with his portrayal of confused saree salesman Vishal facing pre-marital anxiety. The hand sanitiser using, pill popping role of Aakash stays with you even as Hemang gets personal and blames Aakash’s female friend for his OCD.The realistic play has a suggestive set and lights have been mindfully used by Nisarg Purohit in each character’s brief monologue at the start and the end. It would have been a better experience for the around 100 audience had there not been long pauses in switching from one scene to the other and the actors had used a mike.However, on dialogues likesab moh maya haiandmaara pota vala no lagan e vaadi me thatu ayu hai to shu, mari bayari ke chhe ena mota saga vala tya nath aayemakes the audience erupt into bouts of laughter.Still, the comical satire on modern art, astrology, yoga, societal expectations and marriage stays true to entertainment while striking a chord with themamra-loving Amdavadi audience that loves to eat out at a fancy restaurant while blaming the ‘dry state’.Watch it for a hearty laugh with your friends."

It is never heard of that a surprise test is conducted for students without even telling the class teacher. We are only being targeted and harassed because we stood against management’s decision,” added HulkeCEO and general secretary of Sikh education society Sarabjit Kalsi said, “We were concerned about the education of students as the exams are nearing. That is why we had decided to conduct the surprise test. We had even given letter to Hulke that such a test will be conducted as we suspected that he was not giving proper education to the students due to his other priorities.”“Our only concern is students and we want to give them best education that is why we had conducted the test, but the teachers and some parents created ruckus at the school,” added Kalsi."

The court observed that the violence, which was an outcome of a mob protesting a murder, stemmed from an unlawful assembly that adopted non-peaceful means to protest.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Samar Vishal had no doubt that the assembly was unlawful as it caused traffic jam, besides indulging in violence, as part of a common intention. “Prosecution has proved all the three accused to be members of unlawful assembly and being involved in assaulting the police personnel,” the judge noted.The court held that Jarwal, Salim and Dharam Prakash were part of the assembly and assaulted police constables and an assistant sub-inspector. Besides, the violence also resulted in damage of a DTC bus and a few motorbikes. The three accused, therefore, were held guilty under the relevant provision of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.The incident took place on August 30, 2013 when a mob of about 300 persons resorted to stone pelting. The protest was in retaliation to a murder and supposed inaction on the police’s part. A few members of the mob were allegedly provoking the rest to resort to violence. The mob, according to the case, did not pay heed to the police’s appeal to maintain peace, instead ripped off their uniform.Jarwal claimed innocence and took the plea of alibi saying he was not present at the crime scene, but attending to people’s queries at office. He also submitted that it was a political conspiracy against him to defame his image. Akin to Jarwal, the others, too, raised the plea of alibi.The court, however, found no reasons to discredit prosecution witnesses when the defense raised none. Besides, there was no delay in the registration of FIR and the names of accused had figured in the initial complaint itself. “They have been identified by the witnesses as being on the spot,” the court held.Arguments on the quantum of punishment will be heard on March 13."

The theme of this year’s event was the flower Antirrhinum, and visitors were greeted by the same as soon as they entered the show. According to Noida Authority officials, the show has been a platform for many firsts. “For the first time, the Noida Flower Show is being promoted on social media. For the first time, a photography competition has also been organised here. Again, for the first time, the flower show will have drone surveillance as well,” said Rajiv Tyagi, General Manager, Noida Authority.Centerpieces become selfie pointsThe first flower display in the middle of the show was an homage to martyred CRPF soldiers. Other displays included colourful flowers arranged in the form of a waterfall, peacock, elephant and other animals, and drew many children and selfie-clicking youngsters. “It is a bright, sunny day and colourful flowers make for a perfect picture. We read about the show in the newspaper today and decided to spend the evening here,” said Vishwendra Singh, a visitor at the flower show.Paths made with stones led to the entrance of several small parks – that were scattered around the venue – adorned with colourful flowers and wooden decorative items like a little hut, dwarfs, gnomes and even swings! “The miniature parks are made to attract curiosity among people and to show how parks are supposed to be, provided we maintain them. Planting bright and colourful flowers and taking care of them should be a community effort and that is what we want to teach people here,” said Manish Kumar, from theFloricultureDepartment of Noida Authority.Flower entries from around 20 different participants like Northern Railway, Hans Raj College, South and North Delhi Municipal Corporation and many others were alsodisplayed at the show.The Noida Authority displayed how waste – including old water bottles, tyres and jeans – can be used to make decorative plantersWaste-to-decor section floors visitorsTaking a cue from the under-construction Shilp Haat in Sector 33, the Noida Authority displayed how waste – including old water bottles, tyres and jeans – can be used in the form of decorative planters and as solar huts too. The section also featured small fountains and a number of showpieces of aquatic animals and insects. “The wood used here is the waste wood which is acquired from factories like LG and Samsung where it is used for packaging and then discarded. We have created a solar hut that has asolar panelon one side and a vertical garden on the other. All this will be displayed at the Shilp Haat once the flower show is over,” said Tyagi.“Everywhere we look, there is some everyday item which has been used in a unique way. This has inspired me to follow suit. Old clothes have also been used here, which I’ve not seen before,” said Sarika Rawat, a visitor and resident of Sector 55.The stall sellingbonsaiplants was a crowd-pleaser, and also had a penjing display at the backBonsai-making and Pejing at the showThe stall selling bonsai plants was a crowd-pleaser, and also had a penjing display at the back. “Penjing is a form of scenery display through the use of stones and plants, which give the effect of mountains and trees in your own home,” said Saumik Das, the stall owner.The average height of the bonsai plants ranged between one and three feet, and the oldest one was a 57-year-old bonsai of a Banyan tree. “I am very fascinated by these plants and have bought two of these for my home. I also enquired about how to make these and found that I can sign up for bonsai-making classes as well,” said Ruchika Mehra, a resident of Sector 25.Compost-makingApart from stalls selling plants, planters and gardening equipment, one exhibit which garnered people’s attention was that of the compost-making setup for apartments.Compostgeneration through the use of permeable trays was being demonstrated to promote waste management.“Earlier, our grandmothers used to make compost in the backyard. However, flats don’t allow for this. so we’ve created a system through which the kitchen waste from the apartment of a family of four can be converted into compost within one month, which can be further used for gardening,” said Brig Amrit Kapur, from Citizens Environment Improvement Society.The demonstration generated interest among people as awareness regarding waste management has become paramount in the recent times. “I always thought that in order to make compost without a proper backyard, we need those machines which are available in the market. However, this system of using simple trays with some red worms is not just easy but cost-effective as well,” said Rita Mahajan, a resident of Sector 70.Air purifying, herbal plantsAlmost every stall at the flower show was banking on the popularity of air purifying plants which are in high demand considering the low air quality of the city. “Air purifying plants have always been in demand and will continue to be so because they can be put indoors and don’t require much care,” said Simmi, another stall owner.Herbal plants – especially basil, thyme and rosemary – were also selling like hot cakes at the flower show. “I watch a lot of European cooking shows and keep experimenting with my own food as well. We cannot always rely on the dried herbs which are available in the supermarket because the flavours that the fresh herbs emit is unmatchable. I had been looking for these type of potted herbs for a while now but ultimately found them at the flower show,” said Ranjana Kakkar, a resident of Indirapuram.Visitors clicked selfies with the flower displays that resembled animalsStreet Play, photography contestApart from plant lovers at the event, some photography enthusiasts were also seen clicking pictures of the various kinds of flowers and plants on display at the show. “I love clicking nature and what better place to click bright, colourful flowers than the Noida Flower Show? I will also send some entries to the photography contest, hoping I may win!,” said Shivam Sethi, a resident ofKalindi Kunj.A street play performance was also held at the flower show which talked about environment sustainability and saving the girl child. Cultural performances by children also enthralled the audience during the evening."

Rather than looking into the overall political climate and actions of the mob, the author takes a detailed and analytical look into the individuals that were a part of the Godhra genocide. Laul explains it from the point of view of those in Gujarat, giving us the story and backstory of people from every stratum of society who were affected by the riot. The author is a journalist who interviewed several of those who participated or were impacted by the riots before writing the book. An important book, especially published just prior to the 2019 general elections,The Anatomy of Hateis filled with true accounts that will not only inform readers, but seek to shed new light into the national issue of a mass massacre.The focus of the book is on three main characters (names changed)-- an aggressive Hindu who is very proactive in the local branch of the RSS named Suresh; Dungar, an intelligent tribal man who was always shamed for his caste though he tried to rise above it; and Pranav, a well educated college student who was exposed to riots only from the news he'd get at college and the trips he took t around the town. The author interweaves stories of others into the main narrative so the reader is given an in-depth view of the characters involved. It humanises the mob by showing it's constituent individuals and telling us about how their lives led to that pivotal moment.The book starts by describing some nasty scenes of the riots and introduces the three main characters. Following the introduction, the book is divided into three sections: Before, The Twenty-Eighth Again, and After. In the first section she describes the lives of the characters from childhood; in the second, she briefly touches on the riot; and the final section describes the aftermath of the horrible day. Laul contrasts the protagonists' stories by weaving in the stories of their neighbours or family, showing that one cannot always blame circumstance for the way they were shaped.With a strong narrative and extensive research,The Anatomy of Hateprovides one with the closest insight into the 2002 Gujarat riots.How critics view the book:“This is a rare book, brave and fiercely honest, unsettling, deeply troubling. Those who worry about the future of India cannot afford to miss it,” saysHarsh ManderfromThe Hindu"

Their mass gathering and protest created inconvenience to public servants and general public,” read the FIR.Speaking to TOI, Agra district president of Congress Dushyant Sharma said, “We had gone to hand over a memorandum to SSP Amit Pathak inside collectorate, after right wing men associated with BJP vandalised our office on Sunday afternoon, but the officer did not turnup, after which we staged peaceful protest.”“Lodging an FIR against us shows the approach and intentions of police who are acting as puppet of BJP government in the state. We have apprised our high command of the situation and will take appropriate action if the police don't quash the FIR against us and arrest the right-wing men who vandalised our party office,” he added.The FIR was lodged at Nai Ki Mandi police station.Station house officer of Nai Ki Mandi Prem Niwas Sharma said, “We are probing the matter.

What happened to Haren Pandya? Victims of the 2002 riots have not got justice. He lacks humanity and compassion. I feel ashamed,” Banerjee said. “Just because he was questioned by CBI, everyone else has to be questioned too? His role in the riots was a known fact, hence he was questioned.”Saying that chit funds were created in the 1980s, the CM hit back: “Why was no action taken till 2011? They have destroyed the country in the last four years. We do not need their lectures.”Responding to the syndicate barb, Banerjee said: “He himself runs a syndicate of agencies. If it is about syndicate, he himself should be at the top of the top. People are tired of riot syndicate, lynch-ing syndicate, gau rakshak syndicate. He is the leader of syndicate of the agencies. The death knell of his government has been sounded. The expiry date of the Modi gove-rnment is here. He has ruled for five years with the help of CBI, IT and ED. They orchestrated riots and killed people.”“I respected Atalji. But many current leaders of BJP are not worthy of respect. BJP is destroying the country by promoting riots and violence. Democracy is under threat. Agencies are being misused. Political opponents are being targeted,” she said.The Bengal chief minister attacked the government for “destroying the economy with demonetisation and hurried implementation of GST”. “This is a fascist government. He has no courtesy. He does not know the way a PM must speak. His arrogance will soon end,” she said.“The opposition parties have one aim — ‘Modi hatao, desh bachao’. We organised the United India rally. Does he have any allies left? He is busy with his own fashion. He even reads his speeches from a teleprompter. He is good for nothing. He promised to bring back black money. We are in power. They are on their way out. They are bringing leade-rs from all over India to address rallies in Bengal. Had they given even a portion of this money to Bengal, people would have benefitted.”Taking a hard stance against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, Banerjee said: “They want us to pass the Citizenship bill. They are driving Bengalis out. Biharis and Nepalis are also being pe-rsecuted. Nearly 22 lakh Bengalis have been left out of NRC. We will not allow them to incite riots, we will not allow northeastern states to burn, we will not allow sectarian violence. They have to withdraw the bill.”She added: “Twelve thousand farmers have committed suicide during the Narendra Modi regime in India. Demonetisation is a big scam. Jan Dhan is a big scam. Rafale is a big scam. Bengal has withdrawn from Ayushmaan Bharat. Health is a state subject. So are education and agriculture. We have our Swasthya Sathi scheme. Healthcare is free in Bengal. They only speak about welfare of people during elections. They are copying our schemes, but faili-ng miserably while implementing them. For example, the budget of Beti Bachao per state is Rs 3-4 crore. The budget for Kanyashree scheme in Bengal is Rs 7,000 crore. The Centre promised that they will double farmers’ income by 2022. We have already tripled farmers’ income. We have waived khajna tax on agricultural land. We have started a new Krishak Bandhu scheme. What has he done for farmers and labourers?”“Bengal has been depriv-ed. No new trains have been allocated to the state. The new announcement on tax relief is also a hoax. The devil lies in the details. They know they will not remain in power. Hence, they are saying anything they want to. From the judiciary to the media, no one has been spared. What is the reason behind this arrogance? They are jealous of the progress of Bengal. Where were they when the state was suffering during Left rule? BJP and Left have become one. Don’t be surprised if participants at today’s rallies are seen at Brigade tomorrow.”"
