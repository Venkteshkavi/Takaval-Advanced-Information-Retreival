The BJP, however, is not happy with the directive. ""You know that the Lok Sabha elections 2019 are being held in different phases. The Election Commission has directed that the polls be conducted in an impartial manner. Congress workers have worked with diligence and dedication in the last phase of the polls (on April 29). You are asked to submit details such as names, positions and departments of any official or employee found to be careless or biased during poll duty to the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee,"" a letter dated April 30, signed by Kamal Nath as the state Congress president, read. The BJP termed this is as a clear violation of the Model Code of Conduct. ""It is the Election Commission's responsibility to conduct elections in a free-and-fair manner, but the chief minister is trying to pressurise poll officers. The Congress makes a big fuss if (former Chief Minister) Shivraj Singh Chouhan calls up the collector, but Kamal Nath is clearly threatening them. The people will take revenge by polling against the Congress,"" said BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari. The Congress, however, maintained that Kamal Nath had done nothing wrong by sending the letter. ""The BJP is raising a question, but why? Do they not want the elections to be conducted in a free-and-fair manner? Nobody is being threatened in the letter. He is only seeking details on poll officials who support a particular ideology instead of ensuring free-and-fair elections,"" said party spokesperson Narendra Saluja.

5 Villages In UP Threaten To Boycott Polls To Protest Water Shortage,5 Villages In UP Threaten To Boycott Polls To Protest Water Shortage,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lok-sabha-elections-2019-5-villages-in-uttar-pradesh-threaten-to-boycott-polls-to-protest-water-shor-2029922,en,"Facing acute water shortage throughout the year owing to government apathy, voters of five villages in the Jhansi-Lalitpur constituency of Uttar Pradesh have threatened to boycott elections on April 29. Villagers complain that the administration has failed to make use of various water sources and dams present in the region, forcing five villages in this district to face the worst water crisis every year. They say the situation has also triggered migration of families to nearby urban centres. ""The villagers of Lalaun, Gulenda, Chakra, Kasa and Rajpur in Jhansi-Lalitpur constituency have decided to boycott the elections on April 29,"" Mahendra Singh, a villager from Gulenda, told PTI. These five villages have about 5,000 voters, he says. Mr Singh says villagers are often forced to remain awake throughout the night, awaiting their turn to use hand pumps to fetch a bucket of water. Lalitpur district comes under the Jhansi-Lalitpur seat which goes to polls on April 29. The area under the Bundelkhand region is prone to draughts and poor groundwater level as it has a predominant granite base, which does not allow recharging of groundwater. The Bundelkhand region in Uttar Pradesh has four parliamentary seats, including Jhansi-Lalitpur, and 19 assembly constituencies. All these seats are currently held by the ruling BJP. Call it irony, Lalitpur district has 13 dams to harness seven rivers which flow through the region. ""We have decided not to vote in the elections. We have been seeking a solution to our water issues, but the district administration has been passing the buck,"" Mr Singh says. He says a solution is not difficult as there is a rivulet which catches seepage water from Rajghat canal, making it brimming with water throughout the year. ""We are seeking a small lift canal (where water is pumped from lower area to canal on a higher land) from that rivulet to be brought here. It will help recharge groundwater and also solve our irrigation problem,"" says the villager. Mr Singh, who works as a contractor in Lalitpur district, says a survey was conducted to bring water from the rivulet by the previous Samajwadi Party government, but no progress was made in the matter under the present Yogi Adityanath government. These villages also have a large concentration of Saharia tribals who were given over four acres of land by the government. While some of it is rocky, the remaining land also has limited use due to scarce water sources, prompting members of the community to migrate. Manibu, 65, is one such Saharia tribal whose son and family moved to Indore where they do masonry, leaving behind the elderly parents in the village. ""The only problem is water. If we get water, we can cultivate our land here,"" she says. Shiv Gopal of Parmarth, a voluntary organisation working in the field of water conservation, says water level rises during night time in the summers because of moisture from seepage coming from nearby water bodies. He says women wait for their chance to fetch water. ""The water can only be found at 50 feet depth which is basically surface water. Since the base is of granite, there is no groundwater in the region. During summer, this surface water, which is used up through hand pumps, also dries,"" says Sanjay Singh, founder of Parmarth. He claims the entire situation is ""man-made"" because of poor planning and implementation of schemes. ""There are water sources and damns, but water is being diverted to power plants in the region. Farmers are not on the priority list of government officers here,"" he adds. Sanjay, who has been working on the issue of water scarcity in the region, says more creativity and study of the area can help frame better solutions to meet the water shortage. He cites the example of reviving 1,000-year-old huge ponds built by Chandela Kings. He also suggests building check dams to hold rainwater and small canals to divert water to small villages. The Parmarth founder also asserts that all these steps could have been taken using funds under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation scheme. ""MNREGA was a very effective scheme till 2012, but after the SP government and change in the central dispensation, its efficacy dipped because of corruption,"" he alleges. Sanjay's father was reportedly murdered in broad day light for fighting against corruption in MNREGA. Similar was the fate of Rs 7,000 crore relief package for the region between 2010 and 2015. The funds helped to improve irrigation and tap water systems, but the package was later plagued by corruption, he says. Sanjay and other villagers rue that such crucial issues are not finding a mention in the political discourse this election.

Key Hearing In Harvey Weinstein Sex Abuse Case To Be Held In Secret,Key Hearing In Harvey Weinstein Sex Abuse Case To Be Held In Secret,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/key-hearing-in-harvey-weinstein-sex-abuse-case-to-be-held-in-secret-2029291,en,"A New York judge on Friday ordered that a key hearing in the rape and sexual assault case against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein be held behind closed doors, prompting protests from US media. The hearing is important for a trial that has become emblematic of the #MeToo anti-harassment movement, as it will determine whether other women accusing the former mogul of sexual abuse can give evidence, aside from the two whose accusations led to the prosecution. Any testimony from other alleged victims of 67-year-old Weinstein -- one of the most powerful men in Hollywood before a cascade of sexual misconduct allegations precipitated his downfall -- could increase his chances of being convicted. Prosecutor Joan Orbon-Illuzzi said a private hearing was necessary to preserve the confidentiality of accusers whose testimony she wants to present. Weinstein's lawyers maintain that publicly releasing their names and allegations would hurt his chances of getting a fair trial when the case comes to court on June 3. But a lawyer representing 13 media organizations -- including The New York Times and New Yorker magazine, which first broke the news of the accusations against Weinstein in October 2017 -- said the hearing should be public in the interests of press freedom. The lawyer argued that most of the charges against Weinstein had already been discussed in the press and on social media, and said he would immediately appeal the decision. Judge James Burke however said there was ""no alternative method"" and confirmed that the session would be held behind closed doors. Since October 2017, Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than 80 women, including prominent actresses such as Ashley Judd, Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. The case brought in New York -- focused on the alleged assaults on two women -- is however the only one that has resulted in criminal proceedings against Weinstein.

The hostel warden asked the girls to strip ""to check who among them had dumped a used sanitary pad in the hostel washroom"", news agency ANI reported. The university administration terminated two security guards and two hostel wardens as large number of students gathered at the university campus on Tuesday; the university had erupted into protests against the incident which reportedly happened last week. Last year, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had ordered transfer of two teachers at a government school in Fazilka district for stripping school girls in a similar incident. A video clip showed some girls crying and complaining that teachers stripped them in the school in Kundal village.

The ticket has gone to actor Sunny Deol. ""It is my decision that I'm not going to make this a personal issue. I am making a personal sacrifice and will put my entire might and support behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" Ms Kavita told reporters in New Delhi, news agency ANI reported. ""The BJP and my Prime Minister have my support, but at the same time I have to insist that what has happened with me can absolutely not happen again,"" she said. Upset over the party not giving a ticket to her, Ms Khanna said she was told to prepare for fighting the election, only to miss the ticket. ""Everyone agreed that what the party did to me was wrong, they all felt it was my right to contest (from Gurdaspur). I felt very hurt. I understand it is the party's right to decide who the candidate will be, but there is a way of doing it,"" she said. ""They didn't even inform me that they had chosen another candidate. I felt abandoned, rejected and was made to feel insignificant,"" said Ms Kavita, ANI reported. ""It was very upsetting that I was asked to make all preparations but in the end, the ticket was given to someone else. For one and a half month I was with the cadre, I got my papers ready. I had faith in the Prime Minister and party chief that whatever decision they take would be in line with the nation,"" she said. Ms Kavita said she was approached by many national parties after the BJP ""sidelined"" her. ""But I am not one of those people who will take advantage of a particular situation. I would have definitely won from Gurdaspur had I contested as an independent candidate. But this is not about me.

Paris Police Clash With Protesters Ahead Of May Day March,Paris Police Clash With Protesters Ahead Of May Day March,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-police-clash-with-protesters-ahead-of-may-day-march-2031459,en,"Paris riot police fired teargas as they squared off against hardline demonstrators among tens of thousands of May Day protesters, who flooded the city Wednesday in a test for France's zero-tolerance policy on street violence. Tensions were palpable as a heady mix of labour unionists, ""yellow vest"" demonstrators and anti-capitalists gathered in the French capital, putting security forces on high alert. Ahead of the main march, the city was on lockdown with more than 7,400 police and gendarmes deployed with orders from President Emmanuel Macron to take an ""extremely firm stance"" if faced with violence. Clashes briefly erupted on Montparnasse Boulevard, where hundreds of anti-capitalist ""black bloc"" activists pushed to the front of the gathering crowd, hurling bottles and other projectiles at police, who fired tear gas and stingball grenades, an AFP correspondent said. Used at ground level, the grenades release scores of rubber pellets that cause an intense stinging to the legs. Authorities had warned this year's marches would likely spell trouble, coming barely a week after leaders of the yellow vest anti-government movement angrily dismissed a package of tax cuts by President Emmanuel Macron. And with some agitators vowing on social media to turn Paris into ""the capital of rioting"", the government moved to deploy security on an ""exceptional scale"" throughout the capital. Last year, officials were caught off guard by some 1,200 troublemakers who ran amok in Paris, vandalising businesses and clashing with police. By early afternoon, thousands had flocked to the Montparnasse area, many wearing the hi-visibility jackets that gave the name to the yellow vest protesters. Since November, the city has struggled to cope with the weekly yellow vest protests, which have often descended into chaos with a violent minority smashing up and torching shops, restaurants and newspaper stands. Across the city on Wednesday, streets were barricaded and shops had boarded up their windows, with police ordering the closure of all businesses along the route of the main march. ""We are not afraid of the union marches but of the black blocs,"" local restaurant owner Serge Tafanel told AFP. ""Capital of rioting"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said several groups on social media had urged protesters to transform Paris into ""the capital of rioting"", with police gearing up for the arrival of up to 2,000 activists bristling for a fight. Many are anti-capitalist youths, often known as black blocs, who dress in black and wear face masks. Nearly 200 motorcycle units have been deployed across the capital to respond quickly to flare-ups of violence, and drones are being used to track protesters' movements. Castaner said police would carry out pre-emptive searches of anyone planning to march, a new tactic allowed under a security law passed recently in response to the yellow vest violence. From the early hours of Wednesday, several dozen police officers could be seen at the city's main train stations, carrying out bag random searches, AFP journalists said. By early afternoon, police said 165 people had been detained for questioning. Sidelined, unions seek visibility Last Thursday, in a major policy speech aimed at calming the yellow vest anger, Macron promised a string of reforms including tax cuts worth five billion euros ($5.5 billion). The yellow vests rejected it as too little, too late, pledging to keep up the protests, which began last year over rising taxes on fuel and pensions but have since morphed into a wider movement. Although the numbers have steadily fallen, the rallies have remained in the headlines, largely over disorder by a handful of violent protesters along the Champs-Elysees. Following a particularly violent demo in March, the government adopted a ""zero-tolerance"" approach, passing an ""anti-rioter"" bill which included making it a criminal offence to wear a mask at a protest. France's powerful labour unions are also hoping to use the traditional May Day march for workers' rights to raise their profile after finding themselves sidelined for months by the grass-roots yellow vest movement. Like the yellow vests, the unions were also disappointed by Macron's speech. ""We must be careful not to lose the meaning of this day,"" warned Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the CGT, one of France's biggest unions. ""It is a day of mobilisation which deserves our full attention after Emmanuel Macron's announcement in which he said: 'I hear you and I'm not changing anything'.""

The escape occurred at dinner time when several inmates mutinied at the center in Tapachula, in the southern state of Chiapas, according to witnesses. ""There was a large-scale unauthorized exit of people housed in the migratory station,"" the National Institute of Migration (INM) said in a statement. It said 700 returned soon after leaving, but around 600 others were unaccounted for. Since October, tens thousands of Central Americans and Cubans have traversed Mexico in so-called ""caravans"" in the hope of obtaining sanctuary in the United States. The Tapachula center was built to accommodate 900 people, but residents say it sometimes holds as many as 3,000. ""We have many there... we are very tight, we sleep on the floor,"" said one Cuban detainee. It is the third time since October that migrants at Tapachula have rioted against conditions. US President Donald Trump says the migrants are a threat to US national security and has demanded that Mexico detain them and send them home.

Two years into his term in office, Macron is under pressure to quell nearly six months of ""yellow vest"" demonstrations that have brought weekly havoc to cities nationwide. A first salvo of measures offered last December and worth 10 billion euros ($11.13 billion) failed to calm anger among low-income workers. Forty-one year-old Macron, who has struggled to shake off the moniker ""president of the rich"" that links to his past as an investment banker, said he wanted a ""significant"" cut in income tax, which he said would be financed by closing loopholes some companies benefit from. He said government spending would also be squeezed and the French would have to work longer hours. The tax cuts, which come at a time when France is battling to keep its budget deficit in check and stick to European Union rules, would be worth around 5 billion euros, he said. ""We must work more, I've said it before. France works much less than its neighbours. We need to have a real debate on this,"" Macron told an audience of journalists gathered in a gilded hall at the Elysee Palace, speaking from behind a desk. With the 'yellow vest' protesters frequently decrying the political establishment's elitism, Macron said he also wanted to get the French more involved in the democratic process by making it easier to hold referendums on some issues. A new push to decentralise government, breaking away from the historic 'centrist' method where all is decided in Paris, would also be made within a year, and no more schools or hospitals would be closed without backing from the local mayor. Although the number of demonstrators has declined since a peak in November, protesters clashed with police for a 23rd straight week last Saturday, with the sustained unrest having an draining effect on business, tourism and the economy. Thursday's response is the result of a three-month long national debate, during which Macron rolled up his sleeves to discuss issues from high taxes to local democracy with groups of citizens at 'town hall' meetings around the country. Dubbed the ""great debate"", it also involved one meeting where he stayed up debating issues of state with philosophers until after midnight. Despite the criticism levelled at him, and opinion poll ratings that have fallen to around 30 percent, Macron stuck to his guns on his policy platform on Thursday, saying his government had already implemented many reforms and would go on. ""I asked myself: Should we stop everything that was done over the past two years? Did we take a wrong turn? I believe quite the opposite,"" he said. The 'yellow vest' street rebellion erupted over planned diesel tax hikes last November, but quickly morphed into a broader backlash against inequality and a political elite perceived as having lost touch with ordinary voters. Macron, who swept to power promising to ""transform France"" and ""make work pay"", has seen his ambitious reform agenda derailed -- or at least knocked off target -- by the unrest. Pension and unemployment insurance reforms planned for 2019 have made little progress so far. Macron said that the pension reform would be presented to cabinet this summer and that future increases in the lowest pensions would be indexed to inflation, another effort to provide lower-income workers with some succour.

In a letter to the Supreme Court last night, the complainant -- a former employee of the top court - said Justice Ramana should drop out as he is a ""family friend"" of the Chief Justice and close to him. The panel, she added, should have more women judges. The panel was formed on Tuesday after a meeting of the full court, attended by all judges except the Chief Justice. Justice SA Bobde - next in seniority to Justice Gogoi -- had picked the members. He is to head the panel; the third judge is Indira Banerjee. About the selection of the other two members of the panel, Justice Bobde had said, ""I picked Justice Ramana because he is next to me in seniority and Justice Banerjee because she is a woman judge"". Advocate Indira Jaisingh, who has been appearing in the matter as a senior member of the bar, said she was happy with Justice Ramana's decision. The former employee of the top court had made the allegations last week in an affidavit sent to several judges. Chief Justice Gogoi has denied the allegations, saying the independence of the judiciary is ""under threat"" and it was being made a ""scapegoat"".  Alleging a conspiracy, he said, ""There has to be bigger force behind this, they want to deactivate office of Chief Justice"". In a parallel development, a top court bench which is looking into the affidavit of lawyer Utsav Bains, which claims there is a conspiracy against Chief Justice Gogoi, today said his ""bench fixing"" allegations are so serious that it requires investigation"". The court has named retired judge Justice AK Patnaik to investigate the matter. Get the latest election news , live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

Indira Jaising Objects To Advocate Utsav Bains' Car Entry Into Top Court,Indira Jaising Objects To Advocate Utsav Bains' Car Entry Into Top Court,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indira-jaising-objects-to-advocate-utsav-bains-car-entering-the-supreme-court-2028181,en,"Senior advocate Indira Jaising on Wednesday protested against the entry of car of advocate Utsav Bains -- who has filed an affidavit claiming a conspiracy against the Chief Justice of India under the garb of sexual harassment charge -- into the Supreme Court complex without any mandatory valid sticker. Utsav Bains was summoned by the court after he claimed that he was aware of a conspiracy to malign and remove Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi. Ms Jaising protested inside the court against the ""special privileges"" to the advocate. ""Today, he came inside the Supreme Court complex in a Jaguar, a luxury car brand, without any valid sticker...it was a taxi. All our cars have stickers."" Utsav Bains, however, replied that in no way he is connected with the CJI in any capacity. ""I had to come to the court, as I learnt about a conspiracy against the CJI,"" said Utsav Bains. Ms Jaising retorted that no vehicle can come inside the Supreme Court complex without mandatory clearance. Utsav Bains responded by saying that senior advocate Jaising is resorting to personal attacks. A bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that due to a security threat, his movement on the complex was discreet, and he was under the protection of police. The entry on the Supreme Court campus is strictly regulated, as it is treated as a high-security zone. To enter the Supreme Court premises, every vehicle owner is required to procure an entry pass, other than lawyers and employees with proximity card.

She was able to establish herself as a victim of CPM's violence. The BJP, a rising force in the state, organised a rally from Hazra More today, with party workers wearing helmets to protest against rising incidents of violence in the state. Chandra Bose, BJP's candidate for South Kolkata, says, ""We are wearing these helmets to save our head because we have a terror government who are likely to break our heads so we have to protect our heads."" There has been sporadic violence during the first three phases of elections in Bengal. One person died in Murshidabad on Tuesday, though the election observer claimed peaceful polling. Chandra Bose, BJP's South Kolkata candidate said, ""We are wearing helmets to save our head because we have a terror government"" Mr Bose says, ""Political violence has been there in Bengal earlier during the Left Front regime as well, but today it has reached its peak. The BJP would ensure peace returns to Bengal. We will not allow any political party to cause a reign of terror here."" People lining up the road from Hazra More to Jagubabu Bazaar, close to Mamata Banerjee's residence were amused by the helmet rally. Ashish Ghosh, a cloth merchant in Bhowanipore, says, ""We have not experienced any terror here, everything is normal in Bengal."" Pruna Mitra, a businessman, says, ""We have not experienced terror in Bengal. We roam the streets late in the night, there is no problem. I do not think any of these guys are BJP supporters, they are all hired by the party. You should take pictures of these people with helmets, you will find them later roaming the streets without helmets."" Hridesh Das, a TV mechanic is of the opinion, ""I do not think there is a need for a rally with helmets. The situation is not that we need to panic. Many parties have come to us with caps, without caps, to ask for votes, but no one with helmets. I feel this is just a show."" The BJP's graph has been rising in Bengal.

"Donald Trump, Melania Trump To Make UK State Visit In June","Donald Trump, Melania Trump To Make UK State Visit In June",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-melania-trump-to-make-uk-state-visit-in-june-2027600,en,"US President Donald Trump is to make a state visit to Britain June 3-5, just ahead of D-Day commemorations in France, officials said on Tuesday, as campaigners announced large-scale protests against him. Trump is a strong supporter of Brexit but has been highly critical of the way Prime Minister Theresa May has sought to implement the result of a 2016 referendum. Trump and First Lady Melania will be guests of 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, becoming only the third US presidential couple during her reign to receive the honour after George W. Bush in 2003 and Barack Obama in 2011. Trump will also hold talks with May during the trip, with the issue of post-Brexit trade ties looming large. ""We do more together than any two nations in the world and we are both safer and more prosperous because of our cooperation,"" Ms May said in a statement on the visit. She said it would be ""an opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship in areas such as trade, investment, security and defence, and to discuss how we can build on these ties in the years ahead."" 'Her Royal Majesty' The pomp associated with state visits will prove particularly controversial in Britain, where House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has already said he does not want the US president to address parliament. Even the official White House statement drew hilarity online because it referred to Queen Elizabeth by the non-existent title of ""Her Royal Majesty"". ""At least they spelled it right,"" wrote one user. May invited Trump for a state visit in January 2017 when she went to Washington just days after he took office in what was widely seen as an attempt to curry favour as Britain negotiated its break-up with the EU. An online petition to cancel Trump's state visit reached 1.9 million signatures in 2017 and the trip has been delayed several times since then. D-Day commemorations On the last day of his visit, June 5, Trump is to attend a big military ceremony in Portsmouth, southern England, from where ships left for D-Day landings 75 years ago in the largest seaborne invasion in history. Downing Street said the event would be ""one of the greatest British military spectacles in recent history"" involving 26 RAF aircraft and 11 Royal Navy vessels. The event will include veterans of the operation and representatives of allied nations and Germany. ""The freedom we have today would not be possible without the incredible sacrifice of troops from across the world 75 years ago,"" May said. ""I am proud that the UK will host representatives and veterans from allied nations to pay tribute to that sacrifice and recognise the extraordinary cooperation that made the Normandy landings possible,"" she said. 'Not welcome here'  Trump is then to visit Normandy on June 6 for the main D-Day commemorations, the statement said. The White House said Trump would visit the Normandy American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer and hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on ""shared economic and security interests"". British anti-Trump campaign groups meanwhile pledged to mobilise in ""huge numbers"" to protest against the president. When Trump last visited Britain in July 2018, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in opposition, under a large inflatable effigy of Trump as a baby. Shaista Aziz from the Stop Trump coalition blamed Trump for a ""politics of hate and bigotry"" and said it was time for his critics to ""stand up and be counted"". Sabby Dhalu from the Stand Up To Trump group added: ""All those that value peace and hope for a better world for the many must take to the streets and say clearly that Donald Trump is not welcome here"".

London's Climate Change Protesters Halt Street Blockade,London's Climate Change Protesters Halt Street Blockade,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/londons-climate-change-protesters-halt-street-blockade-2027011,en,"Some of London's busiest streets re-opened Monday for the first time in a week as climate change protesters regrouped and plotted a new course after police made over 1,000 arrests. The so-called Extinction Rebellion took over the heart of the UK capital in a bid to focus global attention on rising temperatures and sea levels caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The grassroots group was established last year in Britain by academics and has used social media to become one of the fastest-growing environmental movements in the world. But it abandoned four of the five main protests sites over the weekend in response to a more forceful police approach and an outcry from local businesses that claimed a heavy loss in sales. London Mayor Sadiq Khan also warned Sunday that protests were starting to overstretch the police and limiting their ability to respond to daily crime. ""It simply isn't right to put Londoners' safety at risk like this,"" Khan said. Phase Two Extinction Rebellion organisers retreated by Monday to Marble Arch -- a monument on the edge of Hyde Park that allows limited protests to continue without disrupting traffic. The site has been sanctioned by the police. ""After leaving four of five locations in good order, rebels will meet at Marble Arch on Monday to decide where they go next,"" the group said in a statement. It added that its seven-day campaign has helped it raise nearly &#163;300,000 ($390,000, 345,000 euros) and gain 30,000 new members. The police said they had made 1,065 arrests and charged 53 people since the first protests took over a bridge and renowned London intersections such as Piccadilly and Oxford Circus. ""We remain in frequent contact with the organisers to ensure that the serious disruption to Londoners is brought to a close as soon as possible and that only lawful and peaceful protests continue,"" the police said in a statement. The London campaign has no formal leaders and its immediate plan of action remains unclean. Some of the organisers said Sunday they wanted formal talks with the London mayor and the UK government. The group's list of demands includes a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to a net level of zero by 2025 and a halt to biodiversity loss. The group has previously said that it wants the UK government to ""create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens' Assembly on climate and ecological justice"". But it said Monday that its strategy was still under discussion -- and that it may yet decide to resume the street blockades. ""A proposal has been circulated for entering a 'negotiations' phase,"" it said in a statement. ""Despite being presented otherwise in the media, this idea remains only a proposal,"" it added.

Students Fall Sick After Being Administered Polio Drops In Pakistan,Students Fall Sick After Being Administered Polio Drops In Pakistan,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/students-fall-sick-after-being-administered-polio-drops-in-pakistan-parents-ransack-health-centre-2026984,en,"Several school students in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province reportedly fell ill and were taken to hospital after being administered anti-polio drops during a nation-wide campaign on Monday, sparking violent protests by the parents and relatives who ransacked a local health facility, according to a media report. Pakistan is one of the three countries, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, where polio is still endemic. It launched a country-wide campaign on Monday to administer anti-polio drops 39 million children under five years of age. More than 260,000 polio workers have been deployed to administer anti-polio vaccines to children in all four provinces as well as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Dozens of students of schools in Mashokhel in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa were rushed for medical attention because they felt unwell after being administered the polio vaccine, the Express Tribune reported. While the schools administration and the parents accused the polio vaccine for the students' ill-health, officials associated with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and other health departments rejected it, saying it is the safest vaccine. ""The anti-polio vaccine is the safest vaccine that has protected millions of children from disabilities. The polio vaccine is administered to millions of children in every polio campaign in the country without any adverse effects,"" EOC Coordinator Capt (retd) Kamran Afridi was quoted as saying. Rejecting the reports on various media outlets linking the children''s condition with the vaccine, he said, ""It was reported that children from two private schools in Peshawar fell sick due to the polio vaccine but that is not true. The children are in stable condition."" He also said that the stock of the vaccine had been checked by health officials and was found to be safe and effective. ""The same vaccine stock was used in other areas too and was found to be completely effective with no adverse effects,"" he said. Despite efforts, Pakistan has not been able to completely eliminate the disease. Six cases of polio have been reported so far in 2019. Twelve cases were reported in 2018 and eight in 2017. Attempts to eradicate the crippling disease have been seriously hampered by deadly targeting of vaccination teams in recent years by militants, who oppose the drives, claiming the polio drops cause infertility. Attacks on immunisation teams have claimed 68 lives since December 2012. Earlier this month, member of a polio monitoring team was gunned down on Monday by a man after a verbal brawl during a campaign at a village near Pak-Afghan border. Afridi said that the schools whose students have reported fallen ill after getting administered polio drops had previously refused to allow their pupils to be vaccinated. Soon after the reports of students falling ill appeared, violent protests broke out in Mashokhel and demonstrators ransacked a Basic Health Unit in the area, the report said. Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mehmood Khan sought a report from the officials. Earlier, national coordinator of polio eradication programme Rana Safdar urged people to cooperate with polio teams to administer the drops to their children to fight against this crippling disease.

Some 963 arrests have been made and 42 people charged in connection with the ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests. On the seventh day of demonstrations that have occupied key spots in the British capital, Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed the demonstrators, telling them: ""Humanity is standing at a crossroads."" Organisers said they were willing to switch tactics from disruption to dialogue next week -- if the government enters talks. ""We are prepared to pause, should the government come to the negotiating table,"" Extinction Rebellion spokesman James Fox told AFP. ""What the pause looks like is us stopping an escalation. ""We can discuss leaving if they are willing to discuss our demands. ""At the moment, we haven't received a response from the government... so we're waiting on that."" Extinction Rebellion was established last year in Britain by academics and has become one of the world's fastest-growing environmental movements. Campaigners want governments to declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and be led by new ""citizens' assemblies on climate and ecological justice. ""We're giving them an opportunity now to come and speak to us,"" Fox told AFP. ""If they refuse to come and negotiate with us, then this is going to continue and this is going to escalate in different, diverse and very creative ways."" Thunberg: 'Ecological Crisis' Thunberg, the 16-year-old activist who has inspired pupils worldwide to boycott classes to join climate protests, addressed the cheering crowds at the Marble Arch landmark, the only authorised demonstration site. ""For way too long the politicians and people in power have got away with not doing anything at all to fight the climate crisis and ecological crisis,"" she said. ""But we will make sure that they will not get away with it any longer."" She continued: ""How do we want the future living conditions for all living species to be like? 42 people charged in connection with the ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests. (AFP) ""Humanity is now standing at a crossroads. We must now decide which path we want to take. ""We are waiting for the others to follow our example."" Police said they had managed to clear the protesters from Parliament Square and the Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus junctions. Those charged range in age from 19 to 77. They hail from around England and Wales, with one person from France charged. The charges are for various offences including breaching public order laws, obstructing a highway and obstructing police. Mayor: Time To Stop Calling for an end to the protests, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said more than 9,000 police officers had been responding to the demonstrations, which had left the force as a whole overstretched. ""This is now taking a real toll on our city... this is counter-productive to the cause,"" he said. ""I'm extremely concerned about the impact the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime. ""You must now let London return to business as usual."" In the blazing sunshine on Waterloo Bridge, police lifted protesters and carried them off to waiting police vans. ""I'm genuinely terrified. I think about it all the time. I'm so scared for the world. I feel like there is going to be calamity in my lifetime,"" student Amber Gray told AFP.

Some protesters threw bottles and other objects at police and set fire to vehicles, safety barriers and bins Some protesters threw bottles and other objects at police and set fire to vehicles, safety barriers and bins. Police headquarters reported 126 arrests and 11,000 checks on individual protesters. Paris seemed to bear the brunt of the protests but demonstrations also took place in other French cities, including Bordeaux and Toulouse. ""We want to live with dignity,"" said retired fisherman Joel Blayon at a protest just north of Paris. Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron signed into law legislation giving security forces greater powers at demonstrations but which opponents say violate civil liberties. One measure banned protesters from covering their faces, but France's Constitutional Council, its highest constitutional authority, refused to give the green light to one of the most contentious parts of the legislation. It would also have given the authorities the power to ban from demonstrations any individual ""posing a particularly serious threat to public order"". The ""yellow vest"" movement is demanding changes to the government's social and fiscal policies. Interior ministry figures put the number of demonstrators nationwide at 9,600 at 2 pm (1200 GMT), including 6,700 in the capital.

The reports, it maintained, amounted to being an ""absolutely baseless and mischievous interpretation of facts"". The Legal Rights Observatory (LRO), a Maharashtra-based organisation, had accused the four journalists - Pratidin Time chief editor Nitumoni Saikia, Prag News chief editor Ajit Kumar Bhuyan, InsideNE editor Afrida Hussain and journalist-activist Manjit Mahanta - of ""propagating militant ideology"" during the agitation. The reports suggested that the Centre had asked the Assam government to take action on the basis of the complaint. The Union Home Ministry, however, clarified that it had only ""routinely"" forwarded LRO head Vinay Joshi's complaint to the Assam government, without ordering an inquiry of any kind. ""It is mischievous to suggest that the central government asked the government of Assam to initiate action against any editor or mediaperson in Assam. It reiterates that it is standard practice to forward every petition received to the ministry or state government concerned,"" the clarification added. The BJP remains firm in its resolve to push through the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which had spurred extensive protests across the Northeast earlier this year. Addressing an election rally in Assam's Silchar recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the legislation - aimed at making it easier for non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries to obtain Indian citizenship - will be implemented after ""proper consultations with all sections of society"". Although the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on January 8, it could not be introduced in the upper house.

""If this continues, I do not know what to do,"" said the 53-year-old father of two, who has not been paid in nearly two months and may be forced to sell his house. ""I feel like my hands are tied and I can't sleep at night,"" Mr Poojari told Reuters. ""I haven't told my children anything. They are very young, but they know something is wrong."" Thousands of employees have been stung by the rapid unravelling of Jet Airways, which, saddled with more than $1.2 billion in bank debt, grounded all its planes on Wednesday after lenders rejected a plea for emergency funds. The shutdown has deepened the crisis as dues to lessors, staff and suppliers pile up and lenders scramble to find a buyer for what was once India's largest private airline. Jet Airways CEO Vinay Dube told employees on Wednesday that the sale would take time and could throw up more challenges, but he was confident the airline would fly again. Failure would threaten more than 16,000 staff jobs and thousands more tied to the airline, which at its peak operated over 120 planes and more than 600 daily flights. (Hundreds of angry Jet Airways' employees have protested in New Delhi and Mumbai) More than a dozen employees told Reuters they had gone two to four months without pay. Many grapple with unpaid bills, overdue home loans, school and tuition fees. ""We have stopped going out for movies, to restaurants or any other form of entertainment,"" said a Jet engineer, who is self-tutoring his children after cancelling private tuitions. He is listed as a defaulter in his community for failing to meet his building maintenance fee payments. ""It's a huge stigma for my family,"" he said, declining to be named. 'Save our family' Hundreds of angry employees have protested in New Delhi and Mumbai, accusing management of leaving staff in the dark about the airline's worsening crisis. ""Management never gives us a clear picture,"" airline union leader Chaitanya Mainkar shouted during a protest at Mumbai's international airport on Friday where employees chanted slogans and waved posters that read ""Save Jet Airways, Save Our Family."" Jet pilots appealed for intervention from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is facing wider criticism over the scarcity of jobs as he campaigns for re-election in polls now underway. Last month, PM Modi asked state-run banks to rescue Jet Airways without pushing it into bankruptcy, averting thousands of job losses. But the airline never received the agreed stop-gap loan of about $217 million. ""At least now we know the talks about caring for employment, creating jobs is all an eyewash,"" Captain Asim Valiani, vice president of the National Aviator's Guild representing Jet pilots, told Reuters after the shutdown. ""I've been with Jet for 23 years and am shattered today. I don't know what I will tell our pilots,"" he said, adding the guild would take the airline to court to seek unpaid wages. Murky future Jet Airways has lost key employees as the crisis unfolded. About 400 pilots have moved to other airlines, leaving Jet with about 1,300 pilots, said a senior Jet pilot. About 40 engineers have also left, a senior engineer said. (Jet Airways has lost key employees as the crisis unfolded) Some veteran employees remain loyal to the airline and hope it can be restored to its former glory. ""I have worked here from the beginning - first day, first show,"" said Anil Sahu, a 50-year-old baggage handler with 25 years of service. ""Even after all of this, we have trust in Jet. It's a tsunami that has come, but we hope everything will return to normal,"" he said. Other senior employees like Mr Poojari say they will struggle to find work if the airline fails. ""If I had quit earlier there was still a chance of moving on, but after 26 years and having crossed 50 (years of age), where will I find a job?""

Protests In Lahore After Hindu Teen Allegedly Kidnapped By Muslim Man,Protests In Lahore After Hindu Teen Allegedly Kidnapped By Muslim Man,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/protests-in-lahore-after-hindu-teen-allegedly-kidnapped-by-muslim-man-2025351,en,"The kidnapping of a Hindu girl by an ""influential"" Muslim man in Pakistan's Punjab province has sparked outrage with community members staging a protest in Lahore on Thursday, blocking the city's main road to press the Imran Khan government to recover her safely. Holding placards and banners, Hindu community members at Rahim Yar Khan, some 400-km from Lahore, were demanding that the17-year-old be returned home. The protesters ended demonstration after police assured justice According to the police complaint, the girl was kidnapped by Tahir Tamri, with the help of his father and brothers last month. It said the kidnappers took the girl to Karachi and converted her. She was given a Muslim name after the accused married her. Rahim Yar Khan police chief Umar Farooq Salamat said a police team has been sent to Karachi to locate the girl. ""A police team of RYK is present in Karachi to trace the girl and the suspect and hopefully we will soon trace them,"" he said. Last month, two Hindu teenage sisters were allegedly kidnapped by a group of ""influential"" men from their home in Ghotki district in Sindh on the eve of Holi. Soon after the kidnapping, a video went viral in which a cleric was purportedly shown soleminising the marriage of the two girls, triggering a nationwide outrage. In its annual report, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) this week raised concerns about incidents of forced conversions and marriages of Hindu and Christian girls, saying around 1,000 such cases were reported in the southern Sindh province alone last year.

"Jet Airways Staff Seek Answers On Dues, Protest At Mumbai Headquarters","Jet Airways Staff Seek Answers On Dues, Protest At Mumbai Headquarters",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jet-airways-staff-seek-answers-on-dues-protest-at-mumbai-headquarters-2024907,en,"The employees of debt-laden Jet Airways, which stopped operations on Wednesday indefinitely, turned up today outside the Mumbai headquarters of the carrier that was once India's biggest private airline, to seek answers from the management on how they plan to pay the staff. The protesting group, standing in a loose human chain, blocked the gate of the airline's office. ""Where is the government when so many jobs are on the line?"" a Jet Airways staff told NDTV, standing in front of the Jet Airways building along with his colleagues who were all in their uniforms. ""Gratuity, provident fund, nothing is being given. The Labour Ministry is not doing anything,"" the Jet Airways staff told reporters. Kiran Pawaskar, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and president of All India Jet Airways Officers and Staff Association, arrived at the building to hold talks with Jet Airways' management. The last Jet Airways flight flew on Wednesday from Amritsar to Mumbai before the curtain was drawn for India's oldest private airline. Amid the crisis, the former owner of defunct Kingfisher Airlines, Vijay Mallya, tweeted from Britain questioning why airlines were not doing well in India . ""Even though we were fierce competitors, my sympathies go out to Naresh and Neeta Goyal who built Jet Airways that India should be extremely proud of. Fine airline providing vital connectivity and class service. Sad that so many airlines have bitten the dust in India. Why?"" tweeted Mr Mallya, who is wanted in India for allegedly not repaying creditors. For the last passengers of Jet Airways, it was like any other flight, except for the in-flight announcement that saddened them. ""They announced that this is the last flight. They did it in Amritsar and did it here too. The flight was not full. Some seats were empty,"" a passenger told NDTV. ""There were 40-50 passengers and everybody was saying it is the last flight. There will be no Jet after today and I have been travelling since 1999 and even I felt bad about it,"" another passenger said. Jet Airways leaves a vacuum in India's aviation sector, which other airlines like SpiceJet and IndiGo are trying to fill. The pilots, ground staff and even vendors of Jet Airways continue to grapple with pending salaries. The pilots haven't been paid for three months as the airline now has accumulated a debt of Rs 8,000 crore. ""There is a lot of stress, frustration and depression. Not only the pilot but the entire family is going through a lot of stress and trauma. There is no future. It is uncertain,"" Asim Valiani, a senior Jet Airways pilot, told NDTV. It's mid-level employees like Nitesh Kumar Singh, a customer service executive, who are taking a bigger hit. Mr Singh plans to switch to stand-up comedy, something he has been already doing, if he loses his job. ""Life has been difficult without a salary this month,"" he says. ""I have savings but you cannot manage for a long time on savings. I am also a stand-up comedian. I perform shows means I earn a little from there (Jet Airways). But I am hoping that I will be able to work with the airline for a longer time and the airline will survive,"" he told NDTV. The worst hit are those who are earning the least or are on contact like drivers. They have spent many nights at airports, sleeping on cardboard sheets, in the hope of payments coming through. ""We have not been paid for one-and-a-half months. It is a huge problem and drivers are worried and there is no word on when we will be paid,"" said Laxman, a Jet Airways driver. Another driver, Deepak Jadhav, said, ""They are saying we haven't been paid and the vendor is saying that till the time Jet Airways doesn't make payments, drivers won't be paid. We don't know how we will meet our family expenses. We have to pay school fee."" Several others like auto drivers and snack counters at airports are also complaining of drop in business since Jet Airways started curtailing operations. With 20,000 jobs at stake, the entire business ecosystem around Jet Airways is likely to be affected with this closure.

"Watch: Woman's Tearful Protest On Mercedes Hood Goes Viral, Gets Results","Watch: Woman's Tearful Protest On Mercedes Hood Goes Viral, Gets Results",https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/watch-womans-tearful-protest-on-mercedes-hood-goes-viral-gets-results-2024616,en,"The angry woman sitting on the hood of a red Mercedes was not just an angry woman sitting on the hood of a red Mercedes. She was a metaphor for some of the deeper injustices in Chinese society. And now video of the woman, called by the alias of Wang Qian in Chinese media, has gone viral. In the viral video, an angry Chinese customer found her new @MercedesBenz car leaking oil before even driven out of store. Dealer offered repair but refused to exchange or refund. pic.twitter.com/s8OEBb4T6E ""What has made this highly educated literate person turn into a 'shrew?' It is worth pondering by our whole society,"" one netizen named Qingerting wrote on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. In the video, ""Wang"" is shown sitting on the hood of a red sedan in a Mercedes-Benz dealership showroom in the central Chinese city of Xian. She is crying and complaining that the new CLS 300 coupe she bought in late March, a 30th birthday present for herself, had started to leak oil even before she drove it out of the store. The dealership said it would change the engine but could not give her a refund or a replacement vehicle, and she was unsatisfied with that remedy, prompting her to take extreme measures. ""I'm an educated person, with a master's degree. But this incident is a burning shame for my decades of education,"" she says in the video. ""I wouldn't be doing something so shameful if I thought we could still discuss this."" The video that went viral was six minutes long, but in an 18-minute audio recording of the woman's consultation with the dealership's general manager released separately, ""Wang"" complains that when she went into the dealership, she intended to pay for the car outright. But she says the staff persuaded her to get a loan, and as a result she was charged a ""financial services fee"" of 15,000 yuan, or about $2,200. The whole thing was like watching and listening to a slow-motion car crash, but with only the car, not the crash. It didn't seem to matter that the woman was buying a luxury car that very few of her 1.4 billion compatriots could even dream of buying. In fact, they saw her as the victim of a rich and powerful bully - the car dealer. The woman's creative way of defending her consumer rights struck a chord with Chinese internet commentators. On social media, netizens saw the video as an eruption of the frustration that some have experienced in dealing with dishonest businesses and when seeking help from the authorities to rectify problems. Many commenters praised the woman's composure and how articulate and logical she was when arguing with the dealer. ""I feel that the female Mercedes-Benz owner must have been on her university debate team,"" wrote Weibo user Zhanjieshaonian. ""The logic, the expression is so clear and complete."" Another user, -WHR-, added: ""After watching the video of the whole process of the female Mercedes-Benz owner safeguarding her rights, I have only one feeling: courage is very important, and logic and expression are more important, If it was me, I'd be trapped."" Away from social media, however, the woman was not showered with praise and encouragement. ""Wang"" said she has been threatened and has received text messages every day from people scolding her for her behavior. But her tactics and the resulting attention - in state media as well as online - worked. The customer confirmed Tuesday that she had reached a settlement with the dealership, which includes replacing the old car with a new one and refunding the ""financial services fee."" The timing could hardly have been worse for Mercedes-Benz. The Shanghai International Auto Industry Exhibition, one of the biggest car shows in China, opens on Thursday. As the German company was preparing for the show, it deployed security guards in white helmets to the Mercedes-Benz display, according to Chinese media. And people going to the car show told the Paper, an online news outlet, that after-sale service is important, so the incident would have a negative impact on the brand. Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, confirmed that an agreement was reached and said it has suspended the dealer's franchise in Xian. It also said it was investigating its customer service and business operations. Mercedes-Benz in China issued an apology on its official Weibo account . ""We are deeply sorry for the customer's experience; it has deviated from the principle that the Mercedes-Benz brand has adhered to,"" it said. Authorities in Shaanxi province and nationally also felt the heat of the media blaze. The market regulation bureau in Xian investigated the Mercedes-Benz reseller where the woman purchased the car. It had already urged the dealer to refund her money as soon as possible. The provincial Market Supervision Bureau also said it would launch a special campaign aimed at rectifying problems in the automobile field, according to a local Shaanxi news website. And the China Consumers' Association held a forum Wednesday about automobile consumer rights protection. So ""Wang"" got her settlement, and the authorities said they would work to fix the system that caused her so much grief in the first place. ""Nobody wants to sit on the hood if they have the proper way [to protect their consumer rights],"" she told a Chinese newspaper, adding that she was emotional when she staged the showroom protest. ""I did it because I was feeling helpless,"" she told the Southern Weekly. ""I hope there won't be helpless people in the future.""

"Sudan's Omar al-Bashir In Jail, Protesters Demand Civilian Government","Sudan's Omar al-Bashir In Jail, Protesters Demand Civilian Government",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sudans-omar-al-bashir-in-jail-protesters-demand-civilian-government-2024512,en,"Sudan's military rulers have transferred ousted president Omar al-Bashir to prison, a family source said Wednesday, as demonstrators keep up their sit-in outside the army complex calling for a swift transfer to civilian government. Following the dramatic end to Bashir's rule of three decades last week, he was moved late on Tuesday ""to Kober prison in Khartoum"", the source said without revealing his name for security reasons. Witnesses near the prison in north Khartoum said there was a heavy deployment of soldiers and members of a paramilitary group outside. The 75-year-old's whereabouts have been unknown since a military takeover on Thursday, when the country's new rulers said he was being held ""in a secure place"". The detention of Bashir has failed to pacify protesters, who launched anti-government demonstrations in December and have for days been camped out in front of Khartoum's army headquarters. Sudan's military rulers have made some concessions to protesters, including the sacking Tuesday of prosecutor general Omer Ahmed Mohamed, but demonstrators fear their uprising could be hijacked. ""We faced tear gas, many of us were jailed. We have been shot and many have died. All this because we said what we wanted to,"" protester Fadia Khalaf told news agency AFP. Officials say at least 65 people have been killed in protest-related violence since December, with some of those killed immortalised in a Khartoum mural. While there have been scenes of celebration - with demonstrators singing and waving their national flag - the protest site has grown more tense amid concerns the army will try to clear the sit-in with force. ""Now we fear that our revolution could be stolen, which is why we are keeping our ground here. We are staying here until our demands are met,"" said Khalaf. Earlier this week witnesses said several army vehicles had surrounded the area and that troops were removing the barricades which demonstrators had put up as a security measure. AU warns military rulers On taking power on Thursday the army said a military council would run the country for two years, sparking an immediate backlash from protest leaders who have issued a series of demands. Just a day later former defence minister General Awad Ibn Ouf stepped down as council chief, sparking jubilation on the streets of Khartoum. His successor General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan oversaw weekend talks with political parties, which failed to make headway. Sudan's foreign minister has said Burhan is ""committed to having a complete civilian government"" and has called on other nations to back the council. The military rulers dispatched an envoy to the African Union's headquarters in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, but the regional bloc threatened to suspend Sudan over the coup. The 55-member union has given the military council just 15 days to hand over to civilian rule, while the United Nations has appointed a new envoy to work with the AU on mediating an end to the crisis. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have thrown their support behind the military, whose troops are set to remain in an alliance led by the Gulf powerhouses in Yemen. Western powers which previously called on Bashir to heed protesters' demands have continued to back the demonstrators, pushing for a civilian administration in talks with military rulers.

Nearly 300 Arrested In Climate Change Protests In London,Nearly 300 Arrested In Climate Change Protests In London,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nearly-300-arrested-in-climate-change-protests-in-london-2024338,en,"Nearly 300 people have been arrested in ongoing climate change protests in London that brought parts of the British capital to a standstill, police said Tuesday. Demonstrators began blocking off a bridge and major central road junctions on Monday at the start of a civil disobedience campaign that also saw action in other parts of Europe. The protests were organised by the campaign group Extinction Rebellion, which was established last year in Britain by academics and has become one of the world's fastest-growing environmental movements. London's Metropolitan Police said that by Tuesday evening, 290 arrests had been made. ""We expect demonstrations to continue throughout the coming weeks,"" the police statement said. The arrest figure includes three men and two women who were detained at the UK offices of energy giant Royal Dutch Shell on suspicion of criminal damage. Campaigners daubed graffiti and smashed a window at the Shell Centre building. Protesters stand behind their banner blocking a road near Parliament Square in central London. (AFP) The majority arrested were seized for breaching public order laws and obstructing a highway. The protest saw more than a thousand people block off central London's Waterloo Bridge and lay trees in pots along its length. Later, people set up camps in Hyde Park in preparation for further demonstrations throughout the week. Police Restrictions The police have ordered the protesters to confine themselves to a zone within Marble Arch, a space at the junction of Hyde Park, the Oxford Street main shopping thoroughfare and the Park Lane street of plush hotels. ""We so far have 55 bus routes closed and 500,000 people affected as a result,"" the police said. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""extremely concerned"" about protesters' plans to disrupt the underground on Wednesday. ""Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change,"" he said in a statement. Campaigners want governments to declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and be led by new ""citizens' assemblies on climate and ecological justice"". Extinction Rebellion spokesman James Fox said the group had attempted to maintain a blockade overnight at four sites in central London before the police came to impose the new restriction. Protesters attached themselves to vehicles and to each other using bicycle locks, said the spokesman. ""We have no intention of leaving until the government listens to us,"" he said.

Ashok Gehlot's Caste Comment on President Kovind Draws BJP Protest,Ashok Gehlot's Caste Comment on President Kovind Draws BJP Protest,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ashok-gehlots-caste-comment-on-president-ram-nath-kovind-draws-bjp-wrath-2024445,en,"The Congress today landed in a huge controversy after its senior leader Ashok Gehlot said Ram Nath Kovind was made the President of India because of caste considerations. The BJP called the comment ""anti-Dalit, anti-poor and anti-constitutional"" and demanded an apology and strong action. At a press conference in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, who is also the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, told reporters that ahead of the 2017 assembly elections in Gujarat, the BJP was worried about its chances of forming government and the choice of Presidential candidate was made with votes in mind. ""People say that President Ram Nath Kovind, I read in an article... they got worried that they would not be able to form the government in Gujarat... then Amit Shah chose his weapon - make Kovind ji the President to keep the caste arithmetic correct... and Advaniji was out of the race... the nation had hoped that Mr Advani would get what he deserved,"" he said. ""A very low attack by the Congress against the highest constitutional functionary in this country,"" the BJP said at a press conference held in Delhi within hours. ""Is the Congress against a person who comes from a poor background and belongs to the Dalit community? President Kovind is a highly accomplished individual.  This is a condemnable statement. We expect apology and strong action,"" the BJP's GVL Narasimha Rao said. The Chief Minister's Office told NDTV that it was not Mr Gehlot's personal opinion, he was quoting from an article he had read. Later, Mr Gehlot tweeted: It is very unfortunate that my comments during PC have been misquoted by few media houses. I have the greatest regards for the President of India, and personally for Sh. Ramnath ji whom I have met in person and highly impressed with his simplicity and humbleness. Ram Nath Kovind had succeeded Pranab Mukherjee as the President of India in July 2017. He is the second Dalit president after KR Narayanan, who served from 1997 to 2002. When the former Governor of Bihar - a trained lawyer and a long-time member of the BJP - was chosen as the Presidential candidate, several opposition leaders indicated that they would find it tough to oppose him in view of his caste. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said it came as a surprise to most opposition leaders. ""I am not for a moment saying that the Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind is unfit to be the President... There are other big Dalit leaders in the country."" The opposition, however, fielded another Dalit candidate, former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar. But in the election, Mr Kovind won nearly 66 per cent of the votes cast by an electoral college of lawmakers from the Centre and the states.

"""Draupadi Of Rampur Being Disrobed"": Sushma Swaraj To Mulayam Yadav","""Draupadi Of Rampur Being Disrobed"": Sushma Swaraj To Mulayam Yadav",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/general-elections-2019-draupadi-of-rampur-being-disrobed-sushma-swaraj-to-mulayam-yadav-2023101,en,"Union Minister Sushma Swaraj, condemning a disgusting comment by Samajwadi Party's Rampur candidate Azam Khan allegedly against his BJP rival Jaya Prada, today urged the party's Mulayam Singh Yadav ""not to stay silent at the disrobing of the Draupadi of Rampur"". Azam Khan had, while attacking the actor-turned-politician at a rally on Sunday, said ""...the underwear beneath is khaki."" The comments were made in the presence of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav. In a tweet, Sushma Swaraj drew the attention of his father and Samajwadi patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav to Mr Khan's outrageous comment . ""Mulayam bhai , you are the patriarch of the Samajwadi Party. The Draupadi of Rampur is being disrobed in front of you. Don't make the mistake of staying silent like Bhishma,"" the Foreign Minister tweeted, tagging Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav and party leader Jaya Bachchan, another actor-turned-politician. The minister's analogy refers to an episode of the epic Mahabharata on the attempt to humiliate Pandava Queen Draupadi. On Sunday, Azam Khan had said: ""Many allegations were made against me by the current BJP candidate. I had to swear by my dead mother that they are false. I am not a coward. If I said it, I would have accepted it in front of you. I want to ask you, should one stoop so low in politics? This person who has sucked the blood of Rampur for 10 years - I had led that person to Rampur by the finger. I familiarised the person with the streets of Rampur. I didn't let anyone touch the person or even use filthy language. You made the person your representative for 10 years. But the difference between us, people of Rampur, people of Shahbad, people of India, is that you took 17 years to recognise the person, and I realised in just 17 days that the underwear the person wears is khaki."" Azam Khan has been charged in a First Information Report and the National Commission for Women also says it will take action. Jaya Prada said the Samajwadi Party leader's attacks on her were ""not new for me"". ""It isn't new for me. You might remember that I was a candidate from his party in 2009 when no one supported me after he made comments against me. I'm a woman and I can't even repeat what he said. I don't know what I did to him that he is saying such things,"" Jaya Prada told news agency ANI. The Samajwadi leader, a repeat offender, has since backtracked, denying that he used the words for Jaya Prada and vowing to opt out of the polls if anyone proves that he did. ""I will not contest the polls if proven guilty...I haven't named or insulted anyone and I know what I should say,"" Mr Khan told ANI. ""I was a nine-time MLA from Rampur and have been a minister. I know what to say."" Jaya Prada joined the BJP last month. She had represented Rampur twice in the Lok Sabha - in 2004 and 2009 - as a member of the Samajwadi Party. The 56-year-old actor joined politics in 1994 as a member of the Telugu Desam Party, which was headed by NT Rama Rao. But she left following differences with Chandrababu Naidu and joined the Samajwadi Party. But she was expelled from the Samajwadi Party, along with another leader Amar Singh, following differences with Mulayam Singh Yadav. Jaya Prada alleges she was harassed and abused by Azam Khan and received threats from him.

"""Why Can't You Call It Racism?"": Campus Police Pin Black Student Over ID","""Why Can't You Call It Racism?"": Campus Police Pin Black Student Over ID",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-campus-police-pin-black-student-mcnab-who-refused-to-show-id-2023050,en,"It was 11:30 p.m. Thursday, and the Columbia University senior had just left his late-night Afro-beats dance practice. He had work to do, and his anthropology thesis was looming, so the 23-year-old pulled out his phone to check a Facebook page where students can post and find the most universally reliable staple on American college campuses: free food. Other students had just deposited party leftovers in the nearby Barnard College library, where Columbia students are welcome to study. McNab headed that way. By the end of the night, he would find himself as the latest, forced subject of another viral video - the kind that has dominated the past decade by commanding outrage and reviving, all over again, the tense conversation communities are having nationwide about police use of force, racial profiling and the risks that come with being a person of color in America. On his quest for free food, McNab had an encounter with police, which included a disagreement about his student ID that led officers to forcefully pin him to a countertop. The altercation, filmed by two witnesses, inspired a weekend of unrest at the Columbia and Barnard campuses, where administrators have released statements and held listening sessions and students have called attention to what some consider a chronic problem within the public safety department. Barnard has issued two statements and hired an independent investigator. The officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave. McNab, who said all he wanted to do was work and study this weekend, has instead spent it fielding interviews, answering emails and explaining what it's like to be black. ""There's never a good time for this to happen,"" McNab told The Washington Post. ""But this weekend, I had all these things to do."" The night of the encounter, McNab said he set off into the night toward the free food, crossing the street dividing the Columbia and Barnard campuses and passing in front of a Barnard public safety van waiting to turn left. McNab said he sped up as he crossed, wanting to catch the light before it expired. He walked through the official gate to Barnard's campus, where he heard someone shout: ""Hello, sir! Hello, sir!"" He didn't look back - not this time. McNab thought about the two other occasions he had been stopped by Barnard officers and asked to show his ID, encounters he believes were a result of racial profiling. They once demanded to see his ID as he was leaving a two-hour dance practice. Another time, he left dance practice to run to the bathroom - barefoot - and he was stopped again because the officers thought he was homeless. It's campus policy to ask for student identification after 11 p.m., a rule McNab later said he was aware of but had not thought about in the moment. At the time, he said he believed the officers were only stopping him because of his skin color. McNab kept walking, into the library and toward the food. The female students greeted him, offered him a plate and told him to take as much as he wanted. He scooped up some rice and lamb. Then the officers walked in. There were two of them, then four, then more. They demanded to see McNab's student ID, he and witnesses say, and grabbed McNab's arms. The officers pushed him against the register counter at the coffee shop on the library's first floor. They forced him onto his back. That's when Caroline Cutlip, a Barnard junior who had posted about the free food in the first place, started filming. ""The moment I saw him pinned back on the table, it was so reminiscent of police brutality things I've seen online,"" Cutlip, the only white student watching, later said of her decision. She said she thought to herself: ""I need to say something. I feel like I am someone who can use my privilege to say something here."" ""But I had no clue what to say,"" Cutlip said. ""So I started filming."" In the first of two videos she recorded, McNab is surrounded by at least five public safety officers. ""Take your hands off me!"" McNab yelled as the officers immobilize him. They demanded to see his student ID card. One officer glanced over his shoulder toward the table of Barnard students where Cutlip was filming. The officer looked back at McNab, then again toward Cutlip's camera. He released his grip. ""OK, let's walk outside,"" the officer said. With his hands free, McNab pulled his wallet from the front pocket of his pants. ""You want to see my ID?"" he said, handing them his card. ""I am a Columbia University student. That's me. This is the third time Barnard Public Safety has chased me down."" An officer took McNab's ID card and began to walk outside, again commanding that McNab follow. McNab refused, explaining later to The Post that he wanted to stay near witnesses. He was afraid that leaving the building would jeopardize his safety. In the video, McNab is seen waiting by the Barnard students. He murmurs an apology, and a student firmly responds: ""No, don't be sorry."" The officer says he is going to confirm that McNab is an ""active student,"" and he returns with the student's ID card. Cutlip began filming a second video, this one showing the officers telling McNab that he ran into the building without showing his ID. McNab says he walked, not ran, and the Barnard students back him up. ""I got him running through the courtyard,"" the lead officer says. At the same time, a second officer begins arguing with the Barnard students, saying McNab ran in front of his van. McNab and the other students refute that narrative again, and the second officer raises his voice at a black female student. ""Do you have a gauge that you can measure how fast he was running?"" the officer asked her. ""Does it matter?"" she responded. ""Were you there?"" he said back, walking closer, pointing his finger and eventually telling her to ""relax."" In unison, the other Barnard students repeated the word ""relax"" with exasperation. ""I am relaxed,"" she said. ""Yeah, well I don't see that,"" the officer said. ""Right away, you're taking a . . ."" ""Please stop talking to me,"" she said. The officer walked away, the video cut off and eventually McNab and the Barnard students were alone again in the library, left to rehash what had happened. Several of the Barnard students were crying. ""It showed me that this wasn't just something I went through,"" McNab told The Post. ""They went through this, too."" McNab said another student suggested the incident was worthy of a complaint to Barnard's Title IX officer, so she sent one. Cutlip, a student government representative, had met that morning with the Title IX officer and later worked with her and other student government members to craft an official statement. In the afternoon, Cutlip posted her videos online. By Friday afternoon, Barnard's president, Sian Leah Beilock, released a statement to students and staffers about the ""unfortunate incident"" at the library, but it did not outline any details. ""We deeply regret that this incident occurred, and we are undertaking a thorough review of our public safety officers' actions, and will address our processes and procedures and how they are applied,"" the statement said. Beilock also announced a listening session for Friday evening with public safety officials and members of the Barnard administration. McNab watched as his peers scrutinized the language Barnard officials used to talk about the ""incident,"" listened to them call him ""the student"" and grew disappointed when the administration, in his eyes, didn't squarely confront the racial elements of his experience. He said at the event that he would ""appreciate an apology."" Several administrators repeated the language of the email - that they regret the incident - and used the phrase ""we apologize."" ""Why can't you call it racism?"" a student asked. What McNab said he was looking for, though, came from one Barnard administrator, Dean of Studies Natalie J. Friedman, who welcomed him to campus and thank him for speaking. ""I also apologize on behalf of the college,"" she said, ""for the racist incident that happened."" McNab walked up and shook her hand. ""To me, that was the most beautiful thing she could do,"" he later said. In the days since, administrators from Columbia have released their own statements and several of McNab's anthropology professors have reached out in support. ""I've been trying to figure out the right vocabulary to use,"" McNab said Sunday morning, as he prepared his to-do list. There was his job as a tutor, a paper for one class and a couple of articles for student publications. And there was protest spurred by his altercation. He wanted to go, he said, but ""I was supposed to finish my thesis this weekend.""

Himachal BJP Chief's Obscene Slur For Rahul Gandhi Draws Congress Protest,Himachal BJP Chief's Obscene Slur For Rahul Gandhi Draws Congress Protest,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/himachal-bjp-chief-targets-rahul-gandhi-with-expletive-congress-protests-2023007,en,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi was targeted with an expletive by Himachal Pradesh BJP chief Satpal Singh Satti at a public event in Baddi town of the Shimla Lok Sabha constituency today, provoking protests from the opposition party. Mr Satti said that if Mr Gandhi can call Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- who refers to himself as India's chowkidar (watchman) -- a thief, he is also free to abuse him. ""Rahul Gandhi is out on bail, his mother is out on bail, his brother-in-law is out on bail, and yet he calls the Prime Minister a thief. A Punjabi man asked me to convey this to you with a heavy heart, and that inspires me to tell you this. If PM Modi is a thief, then you are a m********,"" he was heard saying in a video widely circulated on social media. The state unit of the Congress sought an apology from Mr Satti, failing which they would file a complaint with the Election Commission. ""We are taking the opinion of our legal cell. Subsequently, we may just file that complaint,"" Naresh Chauhan, chief spokesperson for the Himachal Congress, said. State Congress chief Kuldeep Rathore said such abusive language was not expected from a senior politician. PM Modi has declared himself as the chowkidar who watches over the country's borders and wealth, and the same idea was used to shape the BJP campaign "" Main Bhi Chowkidar "" for the Lok Sabha elections across the country recently. However, the Congress countered his claim to allege that "" Chowkidar Chor Hain (the watchman is a thief)"", referring to the Rafale fighter jet deal with France in particular. The Congress has alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal, saying that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government when it was negotiating the deal. Incidentally, Mr Satti was not the only politician to make an unsavoury reference to a rival leader today. Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan was caught talking about ""khaki underwear"" on video while campaigning in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur against actress-turned-politician Jaya Prada, a former party colleague who has now joined the BJP. Disclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani's Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal.

""I would like to write to you to inform that since recent past there have been many instances of abuse/man-handling/physical assault of the Doctors and other health staff. The Govt. Doctors and other staff have been feeling highly insecure working at various government hospitals,"" Mr Burman wrote in the letter.

After the election body pointed out that a man who faces a case of theft of voting machines was in Mr Naidu's delegation to meet the poll chief, the party hit back at the poll body and said it is trying to ""avoid addressing the situation."" The rebuttal came ahead of today's meeting of opposition leaders to discuss the issue of voting machines. The Election Commission, in its letter, asked Mr Naidu's Telugu Desam Party why a man who faces a criminal case of theft in 2010 was part of his team to the poll body's office. The letter stated that it was decided that the man, Hari Prasad Vemuru, would get a detailed briefing from the technical team of the commission. ""When the discussions came to the issue of EVMs and their functioning, one of the delegates repeatedly raised various technical issues regarding functioning of EVM and said that he has the requisite technical expertise in the field... However, when this technical person came it turned out that he was Hari Prasad who was involved in a criminal case regarding alleged theft of EVM machine in 2010 in which FIR was filed in... Mumbai,"" the Election Commission said in its letter. The TDP, in its reply, said no chargesheet was filed against Hari Prasad Vemuru in the last nine years and claimed that he is the first Indian to be honoured with the US-based Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award nine years ago. The Election Commission said Hari Prasad was involved in a criminal case regarding alleged theft of EVM machine in 2010. The party hit back at the Election Commission and said, ""...instead of focusing on the issue, commission is trying to avoid addressing the situation."" The TDP said, the commission should, instead, ""comprehend, clarify and resolve the issues raised by Mr Hari Prasad Vemuru on our behalf"". The party said he has co-published a research paper on vulnerability of Indian voting machines. Further backing him, the TDP claimed former Election Commission chiefs SY Qureshi and VS Sampath had welcomed his ideas, which lead to the design of VVPATs or voter paper trail slips. Mr Naidu alleges that 30 to 40 per cent of voting machines in his state did not work properl y on Thursday, the first day of the national election. He has demanded a re-poll in nearly 150 polling and has accused the election body of working on the instructions of the government. Allegations of deleted or missing names on voters' lists were reported from various parts of the country on Thursday. Delhi Chief Minister  Arvind Kejriwal had alleged that votes had been deleted on an ""unprecedented scale"". This afternoon, opposition leaders, including Mr Naidu, Arvind Kejriwal, Congress's Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Nadimul Haque of the Trinamool, representatives from the Left and the Samajwadi Party met in the capital to discuss the the issue of voting machines and transparency in the polling process.

He has threatened a sit-in if there is no positive response from the election watchdog. Hours later, the EC wrote to the TDP asking why a man who faces a criminal case of EVM theft in 2010 was in Mr Naidu's delegation today. ""When the discussions came to the issue of EVMs and their functioning, one of the delegates repeatedly raised various technical issues regarding functioning of EVM and said that he has the requisite technical expertise in the field...

""...This is completely intriguing as to how a so called expert with these antecedents was allowed to be a part of the delegation being led by Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu... It was not found appropriate to have any interaction with Hari Prasad,"" the EC said in the letter. Mr Naidu, who demanded a re-poll in nearly 150 polling stations due to non-functioning of electronic voting machines (EVMs), accused the election body of working on the instructions of the government. ""The Election Commission is an autonomous body. At the same time, they are working on instructions of (PM) Modi and the government of India,"" he told reporters after the meeting. ""Election Commission is not cooperating with us,"" he said. The EC said Hari Prasad was involved in a criminal case regarding alleged theft of EVM machine in 2010 Mr Naidu was accompanied by lawmakers and senior leaders of his Telugu Desam Party (TDP). ""This is a very big farce. Disaster for the nation. I can say it is a big confusion, big mess, big farce,"" Mr Naidu said on Friday. He claimed that as per ""official information"" 4,583 EVMs got stuck in the state and said it was a ""major crisis. ""On the day of polling, Mr Naidu wrote to the Election Commission demanding re-polling. He had earlier claimed that even the voting machines at a polling booth where state Chief Electoral Officer Gopal Krishna Dwivedi went to cast his vote were not functioning. The Chief Minister also hit out at the Election Commission over the appointment of the state Chief Secretary, alleging that the latter was a ""co-accused with Jagan (Reddy)"" in the disproportionate assets case. The TDP chief, who faces a tough fight from Jagan Reddy, also said he would file a review petition in the Supreme Court over its order on counting of VVPAT slips. 25 parliamentary seats and 175 assembly seats in Andhra Pradesh voted in the first phase of the national election.

"Parents Protest Fee Hike In Delhi Private School, Allege Electricity Cut-Off","Parents Protest Fee Hike In Delhi Private School, Allege Electricity Cut-Off",https://www.ndtv.com/education/parents-protest-fee-hike-in-delhi-private-school-allege-electricity-cut-off-due-to-non-payment-2022155,en,"Parents of children of a private school in South Delhi Thursday staged a protest alleging that authorities had cut-off electricity supplies in classrooms after they refused to pay the increased fees. The 12 per cent fee hike, which the parents alleged was implemented by K R Manglam School in Greater Kailash, despite the high court's order not allowing the same. However, school principal Sangeeta Arora said the high court order on fee hike is not applicable to their school as it is built on a private land and not on Delhi Development Authority land. ""It is informed that the HC order referred in your mail pertains to schools that have come up on land allotted by DDA or other governmental agencies. Our school has come up on private land. The allegation of the school increasing the fees despite HC order is therefore not tenable,"" she said. The electricity blackout was not a deliberate attempt, but due to power failure, she said. Gautam Sharma, whose son studies in class 5, said, ""They have increased fee by 12 per cent despite the high court's order and they are forcing parents to pay the hiked fees. Due to non-payment of hiked fee, they have turned off AC and fans of the school and students are studying in such a hot temperature."" Another parent Preeti Kapoor, said, ""Height of shamelessness and irresponsibility has been seen in the K R Manglam School. Teachers left small kids alone and unsafe in the class against the protests, shocking to see that this can happen even in the world class school."" ""Fee hike in private schools is torturing both parents and children. When parents refused to pay increased fees, the school management switched off lights and AC inside classrooms to disturb the kids,"" Saranpreet Singh. Several parents also took to Twitter to post videos of protest outside the school and chaos inside classrooms. The school principal said the parents need to appreciate that school fees is the only source of income. The increasing cost of administration, particularly on account of implementation of seventh CPC or wage incremental factors like DA (twice a year), annual increment payable to staff, higher provision for gratuity on account of increase in salary and length of service do necessitate corresponding increase in fees.

The protests, however, soon turned violent when students allegedly threw stones at cops and police had to resort to use of force. Tear gas shells were fired by the police to clear the blocked road as the ITI students demanded better transportation facilities. In a video, shared by news agency ANI, cops can be seen hitting the students with batons. #WATCH Police baton charge on students while they were protesting over the death of a student in a road accident in Karnal. #Haryana pic.twitter.com/TUnFXUP4TS The protesters, including students and ITI staff, alleged the state-run buses do not stop buses at designated stops forcing them to chase buses. The ITI student, who was killed on Thursday, was allegedly run over by a state-run bus. Soon after his death, students blocked roads on Thursday near the institute but they were dispersed. The protesters claimed the student was hit by the bus but the driver did not immediately bring the vehicle to a halt and the student was crushed to death. A committee has been formed to look into the death of the student, Karnal police chief Surinder Singh Bhoria was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. ""A student died in an accident in Karnal.

Today marks 100 years of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that dates back to 1919 when British troops fired on thousands of unarmed people gathered for a peaceful protest in Amristar. At least 400 people were killed after some 50 British soldiers opened fire within the walled enclosure in Jallianwala Bagh, still pocketed with bullet marks from 100 years ago. The massacre was a symbol of colonial cruelty and was, earlier this week, condemned by British Prime Minister Theresa May in the parliament. She referred to the tragedy as ""shameful scar on British Indian history"". The Prime Minister however, did not issue a formal apology. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi visited the memorial and paid his respects. Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, is to later visit Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial to pay his tributes. Hundreds had held a candlelight march in Amristar on Friday evening to mark the tragic day.

"""I'll Be Back, As Will Citizenship Bill"": PM Modi Promise At Assam Rally","""I'll Be Back, As Will Citizenship Bill"": PM Modi Promise At Assam Rally",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modi-promises-at-assam-rally-ill-be-back-as-will-citizenship-bill-2021718,en,"The BJP will focus on passing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill once it returns to power after the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today, indicating that the party has no plans to back off on an issue that spurred intense protests in the Northeast for months. Addressing an election rally in Assam's Silchar, PM Modi said that the legislation - aimed at making it easier for non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries to obtain Indian citizenship - will be implemented after ""proper consultations with all sections of society"". He, however, assured the people of Assam that their language, culture and identity will be protected when the legislation is taken up for consideration again. Although the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on January 8, it could not be introduced in the upper house. Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who believes that the legislation is unabashedly communal, has vowed to prevent it from getting through the Rajya Sabha. The Prime Minister, in his address, shredded the allegation that the legislation is founded on religious discrimination. ""The Congress did not consider minorities in Pakistan while dividing the country during Independence. The fundamentalists tortured our brothers and sisters in Pakistan. Is Congress not responsible for this? People going to mandirs and gurudwaras in Bangladesh and Pakistan had to come to India,"" he said, adding that the ""sins of the Congress turned such people into foreigners in their own land"". PM Modi also promised to do everything in his power to safeguard Muslim women from the ""curse of triple talaq"". ""We will strongly try to pass the legislation after we come to power at the centre,"" he said. ""Even if the Congress and other opposition parties try, they will not be able to do anything (to stop the legislation). Our daughters will get justice."" Triple talaq, a much-criticised Islamic practice, allows a man to divorce his wife by uttering the word ""talaq"" three times. The Prime Minister quoted sources as saying that the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections witnessed a ""huge wave"" working in the BJP's favour. ""Now that the people have decided in our favour, it will be difficult for the opposition to survive. All the five seats in Assam (which went to the polls today) will be won by the BJP and NDA,"" he claimed. We will ensure implementation of NRC in the entire country. We will remove every single infiltrator from the country, except Buddha, Hindus and Sikhs: Shri @AmitShah #NaMoForNewIndia The BJP's Twitter handle quoted party president Amit Shah as expressing a similar sentiment on the National Register of Citizens (NRC), an initiative aimed at weeding out illegal immigrants. ""We will ensure implementation of the NRC in the entire country. We will remove every single infiltrator from the country, except Buddha, Hindus and Sikhs: Shri @AmitShah (sic),"" the tweet read.

Emmanuel Macron Signs Into Law Controversial French 'Anti-Rioters' Bill,Emmanuel Macron Signs Into Law Controversial French 'Anti-Rioters' Bill,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/french-president-emmanuel-macron-signs-into-law-controversial-french-anti-rioters-bill-2021740,en,"French President Emmanuel Macron has signed into law legislation giving security forces greater powers at demonstrations that opponents claim violates civil liberties, the official journal said Thursday. The bill, which was approved by lawmakers in February, aims to crack down on violence that has marred the ""yellow vest"" protest movement, which has rocked France since erupting in November . Interior minister Christophe Castaner on Thursday hailed the law as a ""text which protects the French in the face of insecurity and violence"". ""It's a text that protects our institutions and our liberties,"" he wrote on Twitter. But in a move indicative of the political trouble caused for Macron by the ""yellow vest"" movement, France's Constitutional Council, its highest constitutional authority, refused this month to give its green light to one of the most contentious parts of the legislation. It would have given the authorities the power to ban from demonstrations any individual ""posing a particularly serious threat to public order"". That article was accompanied by a file of named of people wanted by the police, which critics strongly denounced as violating citizens' freedom of assembly as protected in the constitution. But the council did approve two other key parts of the legislation, including giving the authorities the power to search bags and cars in and around demonstrations at the demand of a prosecutor. It also approved making it a criminal offence to conceal the face at a demonstration, punishable by a year in prison and 15,000 euros ($17,000) in fines. The French minister in charge of relations with parliament, Marc Fesneau, had indicated Wednesday that the government was not planning to go back to parliament to adapt the legislation in further debates. The yellow vest protests against social inequality have proved the biggest challenge to Macron since he came to power, taking much of the momentum out of his reformist agenda. He has since sought to fight back, touring France in town hall-style meetings to listen to people's grievances in a campaign analysts see as a qualified success. Macron is expected to address the nation in the coming days with new measures aimed at assuaging the protesters' anger, in particular over what Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Monday called an ""enormous exasperation"" over taxes. The official journal is France's gazette of record and the appearance of legislation in the publication means it has been enacted into law.

Earlier, Mr Naidu met CEO Gopal Krishna Dwivedi and submitted a memorandum to him, accusing the EC of acting ""on behalf of the YSR Congress under the guidance of the BJP"". The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief also wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner on the issue. He denounced the ""autocratic and partisan attitude"" of the EC in handling election-related matters pertaining to the state. ""It is surprising that the EC is taking partisan and hasty steps to harass and intimidate government officials with a view to trigger panic in their minds for carrying out legitimate responsibilities,"" Mr Naidu alleged, referring to the transfer of the state chief secretary, director general (DG) intelligence and three district superintendents of police (SPs). He also objected to the appointment of retired IPS officer KK Sharma as a special police observer for the Lok Sabha election in the state, alleging that he was a ""prejudiced person with an RSS background"". ""It is strange and surprising that whenever the opposition YSR Congress party made a complaint, the EC not only promptly responded, but also took action without verifying the facts and without giving an opportunity to the officers against whom the complaint was made,"" Naidu said in the memorandum. ""The commission should not fall prey to the baseless allegations of such a political party, the leader of which himself is involved in 31 criminal cases. The complaints filed by the TDP have not so far been attended to by the commission. ""This deliberate inaction on the part of the EC on the complaints filed by the TDP and prompt action on the complaints filed by the YSRC only strengthens the suspicion that the commission has been toeing the line of the Union government led by the BJP and also assisting the political parties which are in connivance with it,"" he alleged. Further, the chief minister noted that ever since the polls were announced and the Model Code of Conduct came into force, the Income Tax authorities had only been targeting TDP candidates, workers and sympathisers. ""This is, thus, creating an atmosphere of fear and terror and not only violating the Model Code of Conduct, but also disturbing the level-playing field,"" he said in the memorandum. None of the candidates belonging to other political parties had been targeted, projecting a message that the TDP candidates and sympathisers alone were the culprits, Mr Naidu added. ""This is encouraging the other parties in the state to make false complaints against the TDP,"" he lamented. ""Therefore, I strongly protest against such tyrannical and undemocratic attitude of the EC and I hope that it conducts its business by giving a level-playing field to all the contesting political parties in the state, upholds the democratic values and respects the Constitution of India,"" the TDP chief added.

The channel had mysteriously showed up on satellite TV networks late last month, drawing protests from the opposition. Stopping the release of the Vivek Oberoi-starrer "" PM Narendra Modi "" till the national elections are over, the Election Commission said that any film ""which has the potential to disturb the level playing field during the elections should not be displayed in the electronic media"", effectively banning the screening of the film, just a day before its release, coinciding with the start of elections. ""That any poster or publicity material concerning any such certified content, which either depicts a candidate (including prospective) for the furtherance (or purported to further) of electoral prospect, directly or indirectly, shall not be put to display in electronic media in the area where MCC (Model Code of Conduct) is in operation,"" the Election Commission's order had said. Sources in the poll body told NDTV that the directive also applies to content on channels like the NaMo TV. The opposition, which had complained to the Election Commission about the channel, welcomed the development. ""I'm glad the Election Commission has taken this stand. It was crude propaganda and a monumental shame for the country that the ruling party indulged in actions like this,"" Sanjay Jha of the Congress said. The BJP, however, maintained that the channel was not in violation of the election code. ""I don't think it is a setback for the government. I don't think the Election Commission found any illegality in the law. It was just showing the achievements of the government and the Prime Minister. It was a positive information initiative. We will be looking at alternatives,"" Vivek Reddy of the BJP said. Tagged officially as a marketing channel but also called a ""news service"" by some providers, NaMo TV is being beamed to all subscribers of most DTH (Direct-To-Home) platforms since March 28. The government said the channel, which borrows the PM's initials and his image for its logo, did not need a license . But Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) complained to the Election Commission against the channel saying it violated the model code of conduct that came into effect on March 10 after the Election Commission announced seven-phase elections from April 11 to May 19.

The government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised it would bring back the bill if voted to power. ""How should it (Citizenship Bill) affect our chances? It's only Congress's propaganda. We are rather taking more steps to protect the north-east. The Congress has damaged the north-east in terms of linguistic, cultural, political rights. Now we will protect the north-east,"" said Mr Rijiju, 47. The main opponents of the Union Minister of State for Home in today's elections are the Congress's Nabam Tuki, a former chief minister, and the National People's Party's Khyoda Apik. ""This is not a special election. For me, every election is as important as the other election,"" Mr Rijiju said. ""I won the elections earlier when BJP had no major base here. People love and affection were with me and this time also they are there. Every election, panchayat, assembly or Lok Sabha, all democratic processes are important..."" Analysts say the BJP may face an uphill task in winning back support of people in the north-east after the massive protests over the Citizenship Bill, which will grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who fled religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and entered India before December 31, 2014. Tribes in the north-east are wary of being run over by the returnees and losing their indigenous identities, despite the government's assurance that nothing of this sort would happen. ""There is no problem. We are already very clear about what we should do and how to protect out people. It's okay, we are already in a comfortable position because of our work and we will ensure that nothing that affects the people of north-east should be done, not only by BJP but by any political party. We are very clear about that,"" Mr Rijiju told NDTV.

Over 55% Polling In Jammu And Kashmir Amid EVM Malfunction Allegations,Over 55% Polling In Jammu And Kashmir Amid EVM Malfunction Allegations,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lok-sabha-elections-2019-13-per-cent-polling-in-jammu-lok-sabha-seat-till-9-am-2021376,en,"Jammu and Kashmir Thursday recorded an overall turnout of over 55 per cent in the Jammu and Baramulla constituencies in the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections, even as there were protests over defective EVMs in some areas. The two constituencies house over 33 lakh electorate. The overall turnout was 55-56 per cent, with the Jammu Lok Sabha constituency recording 72.19 per cent polling and Baramulla registering 35.01 per cent, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Electoral Officer Shaliendra Kumar told reporters in Jammu. Polling was largely peaceful, Mr Kumar said, adding that there was, however, one incident of firing in Palhalan of Baramulla and it was being looked into. To a question on the complaints of EVM malfunctions, the official said, ""We have rectified all of them."" Congress candidate from Jammu, Raman Bhalla, who cast his vote in Jammu, had alleged large scale EVM malfunction in Poonch and Mendhar belt of the constituency. He said people protested over the issue. Another Congress spokesman had claimed that in the EVMs, button number four of the Congress was not functioning and complaints were lodged with poll officials. Former minister and senior Congress leader Shabir Khan had told reporters in Rajouri during the day that defective EVMs had been sent to remote and rural areas of Rajouri and Poonch. But nothing has been done to repair the machines, he had alleged. While polling was underway, the National Conference and the PDP had alleged that uniformed personnel ""coerced"" had people to vote for the BJP. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti tweeted a video showing voters raising anti-BJP slogans after they were allegedly ""roughed up"" by BSF jawans for not voting for the BJP. ""A voter at polling booth in Jammu was manhandled by the BSF because he refused to cast his vote for BJP. Using armed forces at polling stations to coerce people to vote for the BJP shows their desperation & hunger to usurp power by hook or crook,"" she said in her tweet. To this, the chief electoral officer said a BSF assistant commandant and a few other personnel were replaced following the incident over dereliction of duty as they were unable to handle the situation. He, however, counselled politicians to verify facts before putting them in the public domain as he said BSF personnel were not involved in beating the people. Polling began amid tight security at 7 am in the Jammu constituency, with voters in Samba, Jammu, Rajouri and Poonch turning out early morning to exercise their franchise, officials said. While Jammu district recorded 72.19 per cent polling, Samba registered the highest turnout of 73.8 per cent, followed by Rajouri district with 65.7 per cent and Poonch with 68 percent, they said. In the Baramulla seat, Kupwara district registered the highest turnout of 47.7 per cent, followed by Bandipora (30.1 per cent), Baramulla (22.3 per cent), while Kashmiri migrants polled 45 per cent for Baramulla seat, they added. In Rajouri and Poonch border districts, people along the Line of Control came out in large numbers to exercise their franchise, the officials added. Union Minister Jitendra Singh, who cast his vote in Gandhinagar, said there was an enthusiasm among the electorate. The Jammu parliamentary constituency has the highest number of 24 candidates among all the seats. The constituency, spread over four districts of Jammu, Samba, Poonch and Rajouri and covering 20 assembly segments, was won by the BJP's Jugal Kishore in the 2014 general elections. He defeated veteran Congress leader and two-time MP Madan Lal Sharma by a margin of over 2.57 lakh votes. Jugal Kishore is facing a tough contest this time as the National Conference has extended support to the Congress candidate and former minister Raman Bhalla, while the PDP has decided not to field any candidate from the Jammu region to ensure that the secular votes are not divided. The Jammu parliamentary seat has the highest number of 20,05,730 lakh voters, including 9,64,834 women and 20 transgenders, officials said, adding 2,740 polling stations, including dozens near the LoC and the International Border (IB), were set up for the polling.

A former soldier, Colonel (retd) Kirori Singh Bainsla, has been spearheading the protests, demanding five per cent quota in educational institutions and government jobs for Gujjars across Rajasthan. Kirori Singh Bainsla plunged into giving the Gujjar Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti , his organisation, a direction soon after he retired from the forces. The Gujjar leader's father was in the British Indian Army and currently two of his sons are also in the army. Kirori Singh Bainsla had fought during the 1962 war against China and the 1965 war against Pakistan, when he was taken a prisoner of war. People close to him say, he has been able to lead the quota agitation in a focused manner because of his background in the army. Now in his eighties, Kirori Singh Bainsla, has yo-yoed between the Congress and the BJP and has never shied away from announcing that he will support anyone who would give five per cent quota to Gujjars and include the community as part of Scheduled Tribes. Kirori Singh Bainsla had contested the Lok Sabha polls in 2009 on a BJP ticket, but lost to the Congress candidate by a thin margin. In 2007 and 2008, the quota agitation led by the Gujjar leader went out of hand and over 70 people were killed. Vehicles were vandalised and set on fire, and hundreds of trains were stranded. The Gujjars are traditionally a nomadic community, who make up about nine per cent of Rajasthan's population, in around 21 districts of the state.

Mr Patnaik along with senior leaders of the ruling BJD met Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Surendra Kumar to vent their displeasure over the ECI's act. This is the first time that any Chief Minister of Odisha visited office of the CEO to lodge a complaint. Mr Patnaik said the ECI has stopped the fund disbursement under Kalia scheme in the name of Model Code of Conduct (MCC), but alleged that it allowed the the PM-KISAN to operate without any hindrance. ""It is unfortunate that they (ECI) have not stopped the agricultural scheme of the Central government,"" Mr Patnaik told reporters after meeting the CEO. ""I had come to see the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) about (lodging) a strong complaint of the election office of stopping our governments Kalia scheme for the farmers,"" Mr Patnaik said. Mr Patnaik justified his protest and said that the Kalia (Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation) scheme is important for farmers particularly during this season when they require those funds desperately. ""I am also very disappointed to see that BJP had complained to the EC about the Kalia scheme,"" Mr Patnaik said adding, ""the farmers will give them a befitting reply"". Earlier also, the BJD had submitted a memorandum with the CEO in Bhubaneswar and ECI in New Delhi alleging that the state governments direct transfer benefit scheme for agricultural sector was not allowed to be implemented due to the MCC, while no such restrictions were put on the Centres Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan). As per the practice, the financial assistance under the Kalia scheme should have been disbursed among farmers by March 31, 2019, but the CEO under pressure from BJP has stopped the release of the money citing model code of conduct, alleged BJD spokesman Sasmit Patra. While demanding revoke of restriction on the Kalia scheme, the BJD argued that the process of selection of beneficiaries had been completed on March 1, much before the MCC came into force.

In a video released today, he is seen asking leaders and workers from both sides to work unitedly towards securing politician-actor Nikhil Gowda's victory. ""Nikhil Gowda is contesting as the coalition candidate from the Mandya Lok Sabha constituency. I request both Congress leaders and workers and JD(S) leaders and workers to campaign unitedly to ensure Nikhil Gowda's victory,"" news agency PTI quoted the former Chief Minister as saying in the video.

Many have even declared their support for independent candidate Sumalatha Ambareesh, who is contesting the polls with the BJP's backing. Sumalatha is the wife of late actor Ambareesh , who was affiliated to the Congress at the time of his death in November last year. Siddaramaiah had recently called a meeting of Mandya Congress leaders and warned of the various problems that might arise if they do not support Nikhil Gowda. He cited the case of Mysore's Congress candidate Vijayshankar, who would need the regional party's support to win. The local leaders, for their part, said it was difficult to support the Janata Dal (Secular) when they happen to be their arch rival in the district. Today, Karnataka Congress leader Dinesh Gundu Rao also warned of stringent disciplinary action against local leaders who continue to revolt against the joint alliance's choice of candidate. ""If anyone goes against the party decision or does not abide by it, we will have no choice but to take action against them,"" PTI quoted Mr Rao as saying.

Omar Abdullah Protests Against Ban On Civilian Traffic Today,Omar Abdullah Protests Against Ban On Civilian Traffic Today,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/omar-abdullah-protested-against-the-ban-on-civilian-traffic-today-2020904,en,"Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah today protested against a ban on civilian traffic for two days a week on a highway in Jammu and Kashmir. Mr Abdullah sat on a dharna on the highway with his supporters, demanding immediate withdrawal of the ban on civilian traffic imposed by the state administration. Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti also protested against the ban, and reiterated her call to call off the restricted movement for civilians. The state government imposed the ban on civilian traffic for two days a week for smooth movement of security force convoys. The ban came into effect on April 7. It was imposed to prevent any attack similar to the suicide bombing on Jammu-Srinagar highway in February that killed 40 CRPF soldiers. ""...Instead of strengthening local police and improving security measure it shows forces are becoming over defensive,"" former Army chief General VP Malik (retired). The authorities have said the ban will not apply to medical emergencies, movement of lawyers, doctors, tourists, government employees, school buses and agriculturalists. Local traders dealing in perishable items like vegetables and meat, among others, argue that their goods perish on storage as they are unable to carry on normal business on Sunday and Wednesday at markets near the highway.

Over 400 Jammu And Kashmir Politicians Get Back Security After Complaints,Over 400 Jammu And Kashmir Politicians Get Back Security After Complaints,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/security-of-over-400-jammu-and-kashmir-politicians-revoked-following-pulwama-attack-restored-after-c-2019396,en,"The security cover of over 400 Jammu and Kashmir politicians, withdrawn after the Pulwama terror attack in February, has been restored. The decision taken by Chief Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam had triggered widespread protests from parties who highlighted the risk to mainstream politicians in the state. Governor Satya Pal Malik's decision came days after all the major political parties in the state complained to the Election Commission of India. The parties alleged that the withdrawal of security was a conspiracy to sabotage the election process and jeopardise the safety of political workers in the terrorism-hit state. Jammu and Kashmir, which is under governor's rule since last year, will vote for the Lok Sabha elections in five phases from April 11 to May 6 and results will be declared on May 23. In the days after the February 14 Pulwama terror attack that left 40 paramilitary soldiers dead, the governor's administration withdrew the police protection to large number of political workers and separatists. On Friday, the Union Home Ministry had said that the security cover of over 900 ""underserving"" people had been withdrawn in Jammu and Kashmir, freeing 2,768 police personnel. Sources said Governor Malik had expressed his displeasure over the chief secretary presiding over the security review meeting in which the decision to withdraw security to political workers was taken. The State Level Security Review committee is headed by the State Intelligence Chief and it has members from all intelligence agencies and top police officers. ""Never in the past this meeting was presided over by any civilian officer and it was for the first time chief secretary presided over it and took the decision of withdrawing security of hundreds of political workers,"" sources said. Speaking to NDTV, Mr Malik confirmed that he reviewed the decision on the withdrawal of security to political workers. He said the security of all deserving people will be restored immediately. ""A chain of command (of security officials) will review the security of political workers from time to time. In all circumstances, the decision should go through governor (sic),"" he said. ""It's a not a prestige issue for us. It only needs to be rationalised. We will never jeopardise anybody's security,"" the governor said. Mr Malik said he has already spoken to leaders of political parties including Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti and based on their suggestions, the government will address the security concerns of political workers.

"At Ground Zero Of Sabarimala, BJP Trying To Loosen Grip Of Left, Congress","At Ground Zero Of Sabarimala, BJP Trying To Loosen Grip Of Left, Congress",https://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/lok-sabha-elections-2019-at-ground-zero-of-sabarimala-bjp-trying-to-loosen-grip-of-left-congress-2018104,en,"The traditionally bipolar election to the Pathanamthitta Lok Sabha constituency, ground zero of the Sabarimala agitation, has gone triangular this time with the BJP hoping to win over voters who are opposed to implementation of the Supreme Court order on entry of women in the hill shrine. The BJP has fielded its state General Secretary K Surendran, who led the Sabarimala protests against changing temple traditions, while the ruling Left Democratic Front has nominated Veena George, its Aranmula assembly lawmaker, to take on two-time Congress-led UDF Lok Sabha lawmaker Anto Antony. The opposition to the Left government's decision to implement the September 28 Supreme Court order on allowing entry of women of all ages in the shrine of Lord Ayyappa snowballed into a huge agitation that grabbed national headlines. The protests, one of the most violent religious agitations in Kerala, was led by a section of devotees, right wing outfits and the BJP-RSS. During the protests, Mr Surendran was arrested and jailed on various charges, including attempt to murder and the use of criminal force to outrage the modesty of a woman. The constituency consists of assembly seats from Pathanamthitta and Kottayam district. UDF's Antony, who won from the constituency in 2014 and 2009, is leaving no stone unturned to continue his winning streak. He won 41 per cent of votes in the 2014 election and had a winning margin of 56,191 votes. ""He is banking on his developmental credentials. He had done so much for the constituency,"" said a local leader who is assisting Antony in the campaign. However, both Ms George and Mr Surendran are also confident of putting up a good fight to wrest the seat from the UDF. Mr Surendran has been busy visiting families and meeting prominent personalities in the constituency. ""We need to bring back Modi government. It's only the BJP that can promote Sabarimala as a world famous pilgrim centre. When Sabarimala develops, the Pathanamthitta district and constituency develops,"" he said. He alleged that no other political party was interested in developing the shrine. LDF candidate and former journalist Veena George expressed satisfaction over the response of the people during the campaign. ""LDF would register historic victory in the coming Lok Sabha polls. The number of participants in our poll campaign itself is a proof for the immense acceptance of the party,"" she said. Ms George said she will take up with the Centre the issues of Erumely airport and rejuvenation of Pamba river. Pathanamthitta is considered one of the best districts in the country with high human development indices matching most of the developed countries. The district boasts of the cleanest air in India as per a World Health Organisation (WHO) report. It is also one of the least poverty affected districts in the country with a literacy rate of 96.55 per cent. Out of the total population, 56.93 per cent belongs to Hindu community where as 38.12 per cent are from Christian community. The church is an influential body and has been a key player in every field of development including infrastructure for schools, colleges and hospitals. The Nair Service Society (NSS), which is a body representing the powerful Nair community and has been in the forefront of the Sabarimala protests, in a circular Tuesday made it clear that it will continue to maintain equi-distance towards all the three fronts. This would be music to the ears of the ruling Left as the NSS had been upset with the government over the handling of the Sabarimala issue, and the UDF and the BJP were hoping to woo Nair voters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had attacked the Left government over the Sabarimala issue, saying it was trying to disrespect Kerala's culture. The LDF government, which had incurred the wrath of a section of Hindu community by deciding to implement the top court verdict on Sabarimala, had set apart Rs 739 crore for overall development of the temple town in its budget and another Rs 100 crore to the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which administers the Ayyappa shrine. Jayalekshmi, an expert in ecology and environment and a staunch supporter of the Left movement in Kerala, said the political parties were exploiting the sentiments of the devotees. ""The ruling LDF could have shown some restraint in implementing the Supreme Court verdict. The BJP had used the situation. However, the matter is going to be a decisive one in this election,"" she said. The Pandalam royal family, associated with the Sabarimala temple and the agitation, had earlier told the media that they will not campaign for the BJP in the polls. As per the 2011 census, Pathanamthitta has a population of 1,197,412, of which male and female strength was 561,716 and 635,696 respectively. It was also a district which showed a negative growth in population, -2.97 per cent, as per 2001 census. Carved out of neighbouring Kollam, Idukki and Alappuzha districts in 1982, the district has two international airports within a distance of 100 km.

The women say the march is meant to claim their constitutional rights. Over the last decades, women voters have become a significant force in the elections in the country. In the last national elections of 2014 in which the BJP emerged as the single largest party, a record 65.3 per cent the country's 260 million women had voted. Over the last five years, the BJP has pushed through key welfare schemes women. The list includes the flagship "" Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (Save the girl child, educate her"" and the Ujjwala Scheme, that provides subsidised cooking gas to rural women. But the women want 33 per cent reservation in jobs and politics. Raising slogans of "" Azadi lekar rahenge "" they held 150 processions across 20 states. Rights activist Aruna Roy slammed the centre for its ""repressive"" policies. ""If we get this government back, women will lose two fundamental rights--right to freedom of expression and right to equality-- because they (centre) are threatening to change the Constitution,"" she was quoted as saying by news agency Press Trust of India. ""For me, it is absolutely important as a woman that this party does not come back. The last four years have seen the culture of politics change in this country. Violence has become the norm, hatred has become a value. How can I let my country go that way?"" the activist said. At the march in Delhi, Sumedha Bodh, a representative of the Rashtriya Dalit Mahila Andolan, said although women vote, their voices are rarely heard. ""Modiji speaks about '' vikas '' (development), but there is no vikas for women. Caste-based politics will not work. If women are not given their rights, we will find an alternative,"" she said. Kolkata saw over 2500 women join in a very colourful march. There was representation from cross-gender people as well.

Chirag Paswan is contesting in the first phase on April 11.

Pak Court Orders Probe Into Case Of Forced Conversion Of Hindu Girls,Pak Court Orders Probe Into Case Of Forced Conversion Of Hindu Girls,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pak-court-orders-probe-into-case-of-forced-conversion-of-hindu-girls-2016599,en,"The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday formed an independent five-member commission to probe the alleged abduction, forced conversion and marriage of two teenage Hindu girls in Sindh province that led to massive protests by the minority community in the country. A high court bench led by Chief Justice of IHC Athar Minallah heard the petition filed by the two sisters -- Reena, Raveena -- and their alleged spouses, Safdar Ali and Barkat Ali, to seek protection. In their plea, the girls claimed that they belong to a Hindu family of Ghotki, Sindh but converted willfully as they were impressed by Islamic teaching. The counsel for the girls' parents, however, asserted that the case pertained to forced conversion. Their father on Monday also filed a petition in the IHC for a medical board to determine the exact ages of the two sisters as well as to test the girls for Stockholm Syndrome, a state of mind when a victim develops trust or affection for kidnappers. Justice Minallah said the matter requires transparent inquiry and it is the government''s job to conduct probes not the judiciary's. The chief justice said the court had to ensure that there was no forced conversion. The bench formed a five-member commission to probe the matter. The commission includes Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan Chairperson Mehdi Hasan, National Commission on the Status of Women Chairperson Khawar Mumtaz, veteran human rights activist I A Rehman and renowned Islamic scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani. The federal government has been tasked to organise meeting of the commission. The incident came to light when a video surfaced online showing the teenagers'' father and brother claiming the girls were abducted and forcefully converted. It was followed by another video snippet in which the two girls claimed that they had converted to Islam. Amid the uproar, Prime Minister Imran Khan directed Sindh and Punjab to investigate the matter and recover the girls if the forceful conversion allegation was correct. Chief Justice Minallah also ordered that a medical board be constituted to determine the age of the girls. The court ordered the medical board to submit its report at the next hearing on April 11. Earlier, a medical report by Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences stated that the girls were not minors at the time of their marriages. The report was dismissed by the family of the girls as well as opposition lawmaker from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Darshan Punshi, who belongs to the Hindu community. Both the family and the lawmaker demanded an independent medical board to determine the age. The girls and their husbands had filed a petition for protection against threats to their lives. Already, the IHC on March 26 ordered state protection for the couples. The petition also stated that the two girls left their home on March 20 and two days later they willingly converted and entered into marriages. During the hearing, the chief justice noted the increasing number of forced conversion cases from Ghotki. He was irked at the governments'' failure to find a solution. ""Why are such incidents repeatedly being reported from one district of the Sindh province?"" He said the perception that minorities'' rights were not protected has to be changed. When speaking about the rights of minorities, Justice Minallah referenced the recent terror incident in New Zealand''s Christchurch that killed 50 Muslims and the Jessica Arden-led government''s response. The judge asked Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf lawmaker Ramesh Kumar Vankwani why the matter was not raised in the parliament. To which, Vankwani said he will bring the House''s attention to it. Until the inquiry is completed, the high court has ordered for the girls to remain in state custody. They are currently being housed at the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Crisis Centre in Islamabad. The high court summoned reports sought by the premier and adjourned the hearing till April 11. The Hindu community in Pakistan has carried out massive demonstrations calling for strict action to be taken against those responsible for forced conversion and marriages of Hindu girls, while reminding Prime Minister Khan of his promises to the minorities of the country. Last year, Khan during his election campaign had said his party's agenda was to uplift the various religious groups across Pakistan and said they would take effective measures to prevent forced marriages of Hindu girls. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj last month sought details from the Indian envoy in Pakistan into the alleged abduction of the two Hindu teenaged girls and their forcible conversion to Islam. Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan. According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. Majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province. According to media reports, approximately 25 forced marriages take place every month only in Umerkot district in Sindh province.

SSC CGL 2017 Final Result Still On Hold. Supreme Court Allows To Declare Re-Exam Result,SSC CGL 2017 Final Result Still On Hold. Supreme Court Allows To Declare Re-Exam Result,https://www.ndtv.com/jobs/ssc-cgl-2017-result-update-2016169,en,"The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Staff Selection Commission to declare the result of a re-examination of SSC Combined Graduate Level (CGL) 2017 held last year. A bench of Justices S A Bobde and S Abdul Nazeer said that injunction granted on August 31, last year on the declaration of result for SSC CGL, 2017, would not continue on a re-examination conducted on March 9, 2018. The top court said that lakhs of unemployed youths have suffered because someone from the organisation was corrupt. It also set up a high powered committee comprising Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder of tech giant Infosys, and renowned computer scientist Vijay P Bhatkar to suggest reforms for conducting of competitive examinations fairly by government bodies. The bench said that it will decide the terms of reference for the high powered committee at the later stage and posted the matter for further hearing on April 9. The examination papers of the SSC CGL 2017 were allegedly leaked, leading to huge protests from job seekers for several days. Amid the protests, the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) had recommended a CBI probe into the allegations of paper leak. On August 31, last year, the apex court had stayed the declaration of result of the SSC CGL and Combined Higher Secondary Level (CHSL) Examination held in 2017, in which lakhs of students had appeared, saying it seemed that the entire test and the system was ""tainted"". At the outset, the bench Monday asked the Centre to consider re-conducting the 2017 examination as several of the papers were alleged to be tainted. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre said that there was no need for re-examination of entire papers as the leak was ""extremely localised"" and those behind the leaks were identified and action was taken. He said that there was allegation with regard to one paper which was held on February 21, 2018 and the SSC has cancelled that paper and a re-examination was taken on March 9, which was not tainted. The hearing witnessed some heated exchange between advocate Prashant Bhushan and Tushar Mehta which led the court to ask both lawyers to not address each other. Mr Bhushan along with advocate Govind Jee alleged that SSC CGL and SSC Combined High Secondary Level (CHSL) examinations of 2017, were both tainted and fresh examination needs to be conducted. Mr Mehta on other hand contended that SSC HSL was not at all tainted but accepted that question paper was leaked at ""individual level"" for February 21, 2018 examination of SSC CGL, 2017. ""If there was no taint and if you are able to prove that then we will not hold the results and you can declare it,"" the bench said adding that issue requires detailed hearing. On January 10, the apex court had favoured setting up of a three-member high-powered committee comprising Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder of tech giant Infosys, and renowned computer scientist Vijay P Bhatkar to suggest reforms for conducting of competitive examinations. The top court had then ruled out vacating the stay on the declaration of result of SSC CGL and CHSL examinations held in 2017, in which lakhs of students had appeared. The apex court had earlier favoured cancelling the 2017 SSC examination, and holding it afresh by the National Testing Agency or the CBSE ""in the interest of students"". The SSC is a government body which conducts examinations to recruit staff at multiple levels in various ministries and departments. Several lakh students appear in the SSC examination each year and enter government services in Group C and D Categories of jobs once they qualify. The SSC Combined Graduate Level exam has a four-tier system, in which tier I and tier II are computer-based, while in tier III and IV, job applicants take up a descriptive paper and a computer proficiency test or skill test.

Hardik Patel Requests Supreme Court To Cancel Conviction To Contest Polls,Hardik Patel Requests Supreme Court To Cancel Conviction To Contest Polls,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congresss-hardik-patel-requests-supreme-court-to-cancel-his-conviction-in-rioting-case-so-he-can-con-2015951,en,"Patidar leader Hardik Patel moved the Supreme Court today, challenging the Gujarat High Court order, which declined to stay his conviction so that he can contest the Lok Sabha elections, scheduled to start in ten days. The lower court at Mehsana in Gujarat had sentenced him to two years' imprisonment last July, for rioting and arson in 2015, during the Patidar quota protests. The High Court in August 2018 had suspended Hardik Patel's sentence but not the conviction. On Friday, the court declined to cancel his conviction. Under the Representation of the People Act, a convict facing a jail term of two years or more cannot contest unless the conviction is stayed. ""My only fault is that I did not bow down before the BJP . This is the result of fighting the government,"" said the 25-year-old Patidar leader, who had led the quota stir. He said that he will campaign for the Congress - the party he joined earlier this month - across the country. ""We will not get scared. We will keep raising the concerns of the common man with truth, non-violence and honesty. We will ensure that the Congress forms a government. For the party, I will campaign in Gujarat and across the country,"" he said after the court setback last week. The Gujarat government on March 20 opposed stay on Hardik Patel's conviction and sought time to produce more documents related to his petition, seeking cancellation of his conviction. The court granted the government's counsel time till March 26 to submit the documents. After submitting the documents, the state government told the court that Hardik Pate l was a habitual offender and there are several cases against him in various police stations. The public prosecutor had requested for more time from the court to submit additional documents. The Congress leader's lawyer had opposed this and argued before the court that the Gujarat government was wasting time. It is a race against time for Hardik Patel as the last date for filing nominations is April 4.

"Four Palestinians Killed As Thousands Protest At Border, But Gaza-Israel Truce Holds","Four Palestinians Killed As Thousands Protest At Border, But Gaza-Israel Truce Holds",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/four-palestinians-killed-as-thousands-protest-at-border-but-gaza-israel-truce-holds-2015407,en,"Tens of thousands of Gazans gathered at the Israeli border Saturday to mark a year since protests and clashes erupted there, but fears of mass bloodshed were averted after late Egyptian-led negotiations. Four Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, one during an overnight demonstration and three 17-year-olds in clashes later Saturday, the health ministry in Gaza City said. Another 316 Gazans were wounded. But fears of a repeat of similar protests and clashes to those that saw more than 60 Palestinians killed on May 14, when the United States transferred its Israel embassy to Jerusalem, did not materialise. Israel deployed several thousand troops along the border, with the anniversary coming at a sensitive time ahead of its April 9 elections. Egypt tried to mediate between Israel and Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas to rein in violence. Hamas officials say an understanding was reached that would see Israel ease its crippling blockade of Gaza in exchange for the protests remaining calm. Tens of thousands gathered at five protest points along the frontier on Saturday, but the vast majority stayed away from the border fence. East of Gaza City, small groups of young men approached the fence and sought to break it multiple times but were forced back by Israeli tear gas and live fire. The protesters threw stones at the Israeli soldiers. Israeli military vehicles keeping position at border fence, as Palestinians, waving national flags, protest. (AFP) An Egyptian security delegation visited the protest site east of Gaza City, as did Hamas leaders Ismail Haniya and Yahya Sinwar. Israel's army said around 40,000 ""rioters and demonstrators"" had gathered in spots throughout the border. It said grenades and explosive devices were hurled at troops, who responded ""in accordance with standard operating procedures."" Negotiated Calm Protesters were marking the first anniversary of often violent weekly demonstrations in which around 200 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have been killed. At least 50 Palestinian children have been killed in Gaza since the protests began, charity Save the Children said. In the run-up to the anniversary, long-time mediator Egypt had shuttled back and forth in a bid to avoid major bloodshed. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim called Saturday's protest ""a very important message"" that thousands had gathered ""peacefully to raise their voice against aggression and the imposed siege on Gaza."" He confirmed that Egypt had made progress towards a deal that media reports said would see Israel allow more Qatari aid into the strip and ease some restrictions. In exchange Hamas would maintain calm at the border protests. Khalil al-Hayya, another senior figure in the Islamist movement, said they were expecting to receive a timetable from Israel on Sunday. There was no Israeli comment on the alleged agreement. Israel holds a keenly contested general election on April 9 in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces a stiff challenge from centrist former military chief Benny Gantz. He is widely seen as wanting to avoid a major escalation, but has faced accusations of being soft on Hamas, including from former Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who resigned in November the day after an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire was agreed. The anniversary came only days after another severe flare-up between Israel and Hamas, sparked by a rare long-range rocket strike from Gaza that struck north of Tel Aviv. An Egyptian-brokered ceasefire restored calm. The demonstrators are calling for Palestinians to be allowed to return to land their families fled or were expelled from during the 1948 war that accompanied Israel's creation. Israel says any such mass return would spell the end of a Jewish state and that its actions have been necessary to defend the border. Palestinians mark the first anniversary of the ""March of Return"" protests. It accuses Hamas of orchestrating violence, but its soldiers' use of live fire has come under heavy criticism. Last month, a United Nations probe said Israeli soldiers had intentionally fired on civilians in what could constitute war crimes. Two million Palestinians live in impoverished Gaza, crammed between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean. Analysts highlight desperate living conditions and lack of freedom of movement as driving forces behind the protests. Israel, which has fought three wars with Hamas, has blockaded the enclave for more than a decade, and Egypt often closes Gaza's only other gateway to the outside world. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by the United States, European Union and others. Many protesters over the past year have remained far back from the fence and demonstrated peacefully, but others have approached in numbers and clashed with soldiers. Small groups have attached incendiary devices to balloons to float them over the border in an attempt to set fire to nearby Israeli homes and farmland.

"""This Is Self-Goal"": Arun Jaitley On Congress-JDS Anti-Tax Raids Protest","""This Is Self-Goal"": Arun Jaitley On Congress-JDS Anti-Tax Raids Protest",https://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/this-is-self-goal-says-arun-jaitley-on-congress-janata-dal-secular-anti-tax-raids-protest-in-karnata-2015298,en,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today came down heavily on the Congress for protesting against the income tax department in Karnataka, amid allegations by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy that tax raids were unleashed by the centre on people linked to the Congress-Janata Dal Secular coalition in the southern state. Mr Jaitley in a Facebook post said the ""disproportionality"" of the reaction of the Congress and the JDS raised a needle of suspicion. ""If no politician has been searched, no minister has been searched, then why the protest? The Bengaluru case is a textbook method of the UPA on 2 fronts: use government money, round trip it through contractors and beneficiaries to enrich themselves and then lip sympathy for federalism destroying it whenever the opportunity arises. This is a very transparent self-goal,"" Mr Jaitley said in the post titled ""The UPA makes corruption a cause"". Led by Mr Kumaraswamy, Congress and JDS leaders protested in front of the income tax department in Bengaluru on Thursday as tax officers launched raids across Karnataka. Mr Jaitley said it was unprecedented that the chief minister of a state joined the street protest against income tax searches with a political motivation. ""...Was the minister's nephew a PWD (public works department) contractor to whom largesses have been given - a case of nepotism? The CM and the ministers who joined the protest need to answer these questions,"" Mr Jaitley said. Responding to Mr Jaitley, Mr Kumaraswamy today alleged the tax department was ""harassing"" Congress and JDS workers and sought ""immediate intervention"" of the Election Commission. ""A shameful attempt to threaten and generate fear among our workers. We request the Election Commission to immediately intervene and stop this harassment of our workers,"" the chief minister tweeted. The ruling alliance leaders had said the raids on Thursday were targeted at minor irrigation minister CS Puttaraju, his relatives, and associates of Mr Kumaraswamy's brother, PWD minister HD Revanna. The crackdown came a day after Mr Kumaraswamy claimed that pre-dawn tax raids had been planned on Thursday.

"Venezuela Blackout Enters Day 3, President Announces ""Load Management""","Venezuela Blackout Enters Day 3, President Announces ""Load Management""",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/venezuela-blackout-enters-day-3-president-nicolas-maduro-announces-load-management-2013955,en,"Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido on Wednesday called on supporters to take to the streets this weekend to protest a nationwide power outage, while President Nicolas Maduro announced a ""load management"" plan for the coming days. Residents scrambled to find food and water as businesses closed and school was canceled in the second major blackout this month. Power went out in much of the country on Monday afternoon, less than two weeks after electricity was restored following the worst blackout in Venezuela's history. ""The time has come to agitate in every state, in every community, to get water back, get electricity back, get gas back,"" said Guaido, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly. Guaido, who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing President Nicolas Maduro's May 2018 re-election was illegitimate, said the protest was scheduled for Saturday, without offering further details. In an appearance by telephone on state television on Wednesday night, Maduro blamed the more recent blackout on a ""terrorist attack"" on the country's Guri hydroelectric complex, which supplies power to most of the country, by the ""perverse right-wing."" ""Thanks to Corpoelec workers we will be guaranteeing service,"" Maduro said, referring to the state electricity company. ""But we will need to apply a load management plan in the coming days."" Maduro did not provide details of the plan. He said that school and work activities would be suspended on Thursday, and called on supporters to take to the streets on Saturday - the same day Guaido called a protest. Guaido and opposition critics have said the outages are the result of a decade of corruption and mismanagement. Power had returned to around half the country's 24 states on Tuesday night, but went out again at dawn on Wednesday. While blackouts have long been common in the OPEC member nation, particularly outside of capital Caracas, their increasing frequency and severity have left residents concerned that intermittent power may be the new normal. ""I think this is going to be worse than the first blackout,"" said Julio Barrios, 60, an accountant in Caracas who was looking for open stores to buy food or ice. ""A lot of people want to work but there's no transportation, and if there's nobody working the country will be paralyzed."" In the western agriculture-heavy state of Tachira, more than 100,000 liters (26,000 gallons) of milk spoiled after 40 hours without electricity for refrigeration, according to Leonardo Figueroa, the head of the state ranchers' association. Power had returned to around half the country's 24 states on Tuesday night, but went out again at dawn on Wednesday. ""Get out"" In Valencia, Venezuela's third-largest city, residents without electricity or gas in their homes cut wood off trees to cook food before it rotted. ""I am searching for wood because there is no gas in this oil-producing country, there are no public services,"" said Morris de Castro, a lawyer. ""It is impossible to live a normal life and we feel like we are falling backwards."" Guaido has been recognized as Venezuela's rightful leader by most Western and South American countries, and the United States has hit Maduro's government with sanctions meant to cripple the Socialist Party's sources of income. But Maduro has held on thanks to continued loyalty by top military commanders and diplomatic support from Russia and China, who accuse the United States of seeking a coup against him. Two Russian air force planes carrying nearly 100 troops landed outside Caracas on Saturday, escalating tensions. While hosting Guaido's wife, journalist Fabiana Rosales, in the White House on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said ""Russia has to get out"" and that ""all options are open"" as to how to make that happen. Russia has said the visit is part of a military technical cooperation agreement with Venezuela. The blackout has harmed the oil industry, the lifeblood of Venezuela's struggling economy. The country's main oil export port of Jose and four crude upgraders, needed to convert Venezuela's heavy oil into exportable grades, have been halted since Monday, industry sources said. ""Power came back at around 10 a.m., but we still were not in a condition to restart,"" a worker at one of the upgraders said, adding that workers would attempt to restart the facilities later on Wednesday. Julio Castro of non-profit organization Doctors for Health said an 81-year-old woman died on Tuesday in a hospital in the central state of Aragua because the elevators were not functioning and she could not get to the area where she could receive treatment. The group said 24 people died during the previous blackout in public hospitals due to problems caused by the lack of power.

"Sabarimala Will Help Make ""Big Gains"" In Kerala: BJP's Election Candidate","Sabarimala Will Help Make ""Big Gains"" In Kerala: BJP's Election Candidate",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sabarimala-will-help-make-big-gains-in-kerala-bjps-election-candidate-2014812,en,"The controversy over the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple will help the BJP make inroads into Kerala, says the party's candidate K Rajasekharan while stressing that the disconnect between the people and the governments of the Congress and Left is an ever widening one. Mr Rajasekharan recently resigned as governor of Mizoram to contest as the BJP's candidate from Thiruvananthapuram against Congress' Shashi Tharoor, a two-term sitting MP from the constituency. He said the people of Kerala have understood the BJP stands for the preservation of their culture and traditions and will never play with their sentiments. ""People from all religions in Kerala want to have the liberty to maintain their traditional customs. They want the liberty to observe, perform their customs and traditions, may it be temples, mosques or churches,"" Mr Rajasekharan told news agency PTI in an interview. The 66-year-old, who began his career as a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker in the 1970s, said only the BJP can preserve the state's diversity. The Sabarimala issue will feature prominently during the BJP's campaign in Kerala, he added. ""The BJP is for preservation of diversity of such issues and... we are highlighting the Sabarimala issue. People of Kerala know that we are for the protection of the state. ""The BJP will gain from the Sabarimala issue. There is a disconnect between Congress/Communist governments and the people over various issues, including the Sabarimala controversy,"" he added. The Sabarimala temple of Lord Ayyappa witnessed frenzied protests by devotees opposing implementation of the landmark September 28, 2018 Supreme Court verdict permitting women of all age groups to enter the hill shrine. The temple had a centuries-old ban on the entry of women of menstruating age in the sanctum sanctorum. The BJP voiced its protest against the Supreme Court verdict and asked the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in the state to file a review petition against the top court's decision. Mr Rajasekharan was president of the Kerala unit of the BJP between December 2015 and May 2018 following which he was appointed governor of the northeastern state of Mizoram. It was under Mr Rajasekharan's leadership that the BJP opened its account in Kerala by winning the Nemom seat in the 2016 assembly polls. The BJP stood second in several other assembly constituencies where it struggled to bag even a couple of hundred votes, party workers pointed out. Given his popularity in the state, BJP president Amit Shah asked him to resign as governor and contest the Lok Sabha elections from Thiruvananthapuram, they said. Mr Rajasekharan said the people were getting fed up of the coalition fronts such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led LDF and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) which have been ruling the state since late the 1970s. He claimed the people of the state wanted a government that would implement the Centre's schemes and not just make hollow promises. ""Kerala's people have already seen the UDF and LDF. They could not retain the respect from the public. They could not attend to the problems of the general public,"" he said. According to Mr Rajasekharan, Kerala continues to suffer the most basic lack of infrastructure even 63 years after attaining statehood. The lack of adequate highways, railway connectivity and employment avenues in villages are only some of the problems, he said, adding that the disconnect between governments and the people has long been widening. He also alleged that a sum of Rs 6,000 crore given to the Kerala government by the Centre for developmental work has neither been utilised nor been accounted for. ""The Narendra Modi-led government gave nearly 6,000 crore in the last five years but the state government did not implement any of the works, making it a major issue. The projects were mostly given for national highways and roads in rural areas. However, the state government can't even give proper records on where was it used,"" he said. Talking about the Thiruvananthapuram parliamentary constituency, Mr Rajasekharan said the existing parliamentarian was not even listening to the woes of people. ""The Thiruvananthapuram representative does not even have time for his own people,"" he said without naming Shashi Tharoor. ""Under this Congress parliamentarian, even the city metro rail project has seen many hurdles. What is he for if he cannot stand for the welfare of the people and his constituency,"" he added. ""The last 10 years were honeymoon years for him (Shashi Tharoor) but this time he will be thrown out as the people have realised the need for a BJP candidate from Thiruvananthapuram,"" Mr Rajasekharan added.

Announcing the opposition alliance's seat pact for Bihar and the RJD's (Rashtriya Janata Dal) candidates on Friday, Tejashwi Yadav said party leader Chandrika Rai would contest from Saran. Chandrika Rai is the estranged father-in-law of Tej Pratap Yadav, who filed for divorce in November from the senior leader's daughter Aishwarya. Yesterday, the 30-year-old tweeted that he had quit as the RJD's student wing leader with a cryptic message: ""Naive are those who think I am naive. I know exactly who stands where."" Reports suggest Tej Pratap could contest the national election in Bihar against his father-in-law. Tejashwi, asked today about his brother Tej Pratap's tweet, replied with another question: ""Didn't you see his statement that he's my Krishna and I'm his Arjun?"" RJD sources said Tej Pratap had been stewing over the decision of his brother to field his father-in-law from Saran, a seat which their father Lalu Yadav has won four times. Tej Pratap felt ""insulted and humiliated"" and will contest the polls against him as an independent candidate, news agency IANS quoted a party leader as saying. Tej Pratap Yadav is yet to make an official announcement. He has been adamant on going through with the divorce despite his family urging him to reconsider. Tej Pratap and Tejashwi have not been on the best of terms in the past year. Tej Pratap's resentment has grown in proportion to his younger brother's rise in politics since their father was sentenced to a jail term for corruption. Tejashwi, the leader of opposition in Bihar, is seen by many as Lalu Yadav's political heir. In contrast, Tej Pratap has acquired the reputation of being impulsive, short-tempered and attention-seeking. Whenever he has gone public with his grievances, the family has tried to project unity with a photo-op soon after.

JNU Vice-Chancellor said he will not file a police complaint against the students who ""barged "" into his house on Monday, but strict disciplinary action will be taken against them as per the varsity rules.

Sushma Swaraj Has A Twitter Spat With Pak Minister Over Minorities,Sushma Swaraj Has A Twitter Spat With Pak Minister Over Minorities,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sushma-swaraj-has-a-twitter-spat-with-pakistan-minister-over-minorities-fawad-hussain-2012056,en,"Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj's tweet regarding the alleged abduction and conversion of two Hindu girls in Pakistan, has drawn a sharp response from its minister Fawad Hussain. The matter, Mr Hussain said, was an ""internal issue"" of Pakistan. Ms Swaraj immediately shot back that her tweet, asking the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad for a report, was making the Pakistan minister ""jittery"". Last year, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had taken a swipe at India after actor Naseeruddin Shah's comment on mob violence over cow vigilantism. Mr Khan had said he would show India ""how to treat minorities"". Over the last month, there has been a huge face-off between New Delhi and Islamabad over Jaish-e Mohammad suicide bombing in Jammu ad Kashmir's Pulwama that killed 40 CRPF personnel. Days later, Indian Air Force held air strikes on a Jaish-e Mohammad camp in Pakistan's Balakot, which was followed by an aerial dogfight. Today, tagging a media report on the alleged abduction, Ms Swaraj tweeted: "" I have asked Indian High Commissioner in Pakistan to send a report on this. @IndiainPakistan. Two Hindu girls abducted on Holi eve in Pakistan's Sindh"". Fawad Hussain, the information minister in the government of Imran Khan, tweeted: Mam its Pakistin internal issue and rest assure its not Modi's India where minorities are subjugated its Imran Khan's Naya Pak where white color of our flag is equally dearer to us.I hope you ll act with same diligence when it comes to rights of Indian Minorities https://t.co/MQC1AnnmGR Ms Swaraj responded: Mr.Minister @fawadchaudhry - I only asked for a report from Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad about the kidnapping and forced conversion of two minor Hindu girls to Islam. This was enough to make you jittery. This only shows your guilty conscience. @IndiainPakistan That drew another response from the Pakistan Minister: Madam Minister I am happy that in the Indian administration we have people who care for minority rights in other countries. I sincerely hope that your conscience will allow you to stand up for minorities at home as well. Gujarat and Jammu must weigh heavily on your soul. https://t.co/7D0vMiUI42 According to a report in the Times of India , two Hindu girls were allegedly abducted and forcibly converted to Islam in Pakistan's Sindh province on the eve of Holi. The report said the local Hindu community had staged protests and demanded action against the perpetrators. India has repeatedly flagged the plight of minorities in Pakistan, particularly the Hindu community. In one of its key initiatives, the government has undertaken to provide citizenship to illegal migrants from the minority communities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, who have stayed in India for six years. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, but has been stalled in the Rajya Sabha by the opposition.

The 31-year-old suspect, John Murphy, from Barnet in the north of the city, was charged with assault by beating in a pro-Brexit protest. Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot told Westminster Magistrates' Court that she had taken into account the ""current climate"" in jailing the man, calling it ""an attack on our democratic process"". Corbyn was not hurt in the incident, which occurred during a visit to the Finsbury Park Mosque in his Islington constituency in north London. Corbyn said he was ""shocked and surprised"" by the attack, in a statement read to court. ""I feel these kind of attacks drive a wedge between elected representatives and those who elect them in the first place. We are now reviewing and increasing my security protection."" The mosque was the scene of an anti-Muslim attack in June 2017, when a man drove a van into worshippers leaving late-night prayers.

The circular dated March 13 reads: ""All the Heads of the Department are hereby directed to convene the meeting of faculties and to prepare a shelf of projects to be taken for research study pertaining to their subject considering national priorities. The student can opt from the shelf of projects."" It also states ""...discourage research in irrelevant areas. When fellows are being admitted for PhDs, the topic for PhDs should be in accordance to national priorities. Allotting privilege topics to students should be dispensed with."" ""I was absolutely shocked when I read this circular. How can a circular like this be passed to all departments, and remain unnoticed. The only thing I could do is resign from board. I thought it was a very insignificant act on my behalf, but the only thing I could do. Who decides what are national priorities? And why should research be restricted to just that?"" Professor Pillai, who resigned from the Board of Studies of English and Comparative Literature, told NDTV. Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday took a jab at Education Minister Prakash Javadekar over the circular on research topics in PhD. Mr Gandhi shared a report on Facebook about the HRD ministry's order on PhDs. ""Now, self-attested wise minister (Javadekar) of a very wise Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) will tell the intellectuals of the country how they should do their work. It has been rightly said that 'a little knowledge is a dangerous thing',"" he posted in Hindi. Congress member of parliament from Thiruvananthpuram Shashi Tharoor on Twitter asked people to join her protest: ""Disgraceful HRD instruction that researchers can pursue PhDs only on topics of 'national interest' prompts Kerala professor to quit. The rest of us can join her protest by voting the  troglodytes out!"" he tweeted. The Central University of Kerala comes under the Ministry of Human Resource Development but it's not clear on whose direction the circular was issued. The circular was signed by the university registrar. However, after the professor's resignation, the university issued a clarification saying: ""It came to the notice of the Central University of Kerala administration that a circular issued by the University dated 13.03.2019 is highly misinterpreted in some of the media."" The usage of ""National Priority"" in the circular pertains to the topics that would benefit the economic, social and technological advancement of the nation and society, the university said. The research areas may include latest developments in nano technology, nano medicine, artificial intelligence, space research, nuclear science, sustainable development, climate change, organic farming among others, it added.

HD Deve Gowda To Contest Lok Sabha Polls From Karnataka's Tumakuru: Party,HD Deve Gowda To Contest Lok Sabha Polls From Karnataka's Tumakuru: Party,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hd-deve-gowda-tumkur-to-contest-lok-sabha-elections-2019-from-karnatakas-tumakuru-2011795,en,"After weeks of suspense, the announcement was finally made on Saturday. Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda will contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the Tumakuru constituency in Karnataka as the candidate for the Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) and Congress alliance, his party said. Last week, Mr Deve Gowda had handed over his seat - Hassan in southern Karnataka - to grandson Prajwal Revanna at a public event in the parliamentary constituency in a moment that had leaders from the three generations of the JD-S in tears . Mandya, the other seat which is right now represented by the JD-S in parliament, too was given to another grandson of Mr Deve Gowda - Nikhil Kumaraswamy, son of Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy. This had raised the question about where HD Deve Gowda would choose to contest from. With the announcement of Mr Deve Gowda's candidacy by his party, three of the eight seats the JD-S managed to wrest from coalition partner Congress will go to the Gowda family. After long-drawn negotiations, the Congress and the JD-S had come to a 20-8 seat sharing agreement last week . However, Saturday's decision immediately triggered a protest from the Congress lawmaker who represents Tumakuru. ""I'm a sitting MP from here and I have delivered at the floor of the house. Why have you denied me the ticket? It is not correct,"" SP Muddahanumegowda said. ""Elected representatives and all local leaders want me to contest. That's why on Monday we will start a procession from BGS Circle to DC Office and I'll file the nomination with the support of all our leaders as the Congress candidate for Tumakuru,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Voting for the 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka will be held in two phases on April 18 and 23. Results will be declared on May 23.

Hundreds Of Thousands Protest In London To Demand New Brexit Vote,Hundreds Of Thousands Protest In London To Demand New Brexit Vote,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hundreds-of-thousands-protest-in-london-to-demand-new-brexit-referendum-2011931,en,"Hundreds of thousands of protesters swamped London on Saturday demanding another referendum on EU membership amid political paralysis over Brexit, in one of the country's biggest protests in decades. Organisers said about a million people opposed to Britain leaving the European Union joined what they called the ""Put it to the People"" march, descending on the capital by road and rail from across the country. Wielding an array of anti-Brexit signs and EU flags, they first gathered at Hyde Park before walking the approximately two-mile route to Westminster -- whistling, cheering and chanting. ""It's terrible,"" protester Emma Sword told AFP of the current political gridlock. ""We need to revoke Article 50 and if we can't do that, then we need the people's vote,"" she said, referring to the EU legal mechanism Britain invoked for Brexit. At the endpoint of the march outside parliament, speakers including Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and opposition Labour deputy leader Tom Watson rallied the crowds through the afternoon. ""We've seen how the government has ignored our warnings time and time again,"" said Khan. ""It's time to say loud and clear: enough is enough."" A host of other political figures also joined the demonstration, including Independent Group MPs who quit Britain's two mainstream parties -- the Conservatives and Labour -- earlier this year in protest at their Brexit policies. ""This cause is actually bigger than any political party, it is bigger than any tribalism, and it is what unites us,"" said Anna Soubry, one of the breakaway lawmakers. But with the protest coming just days after EU leaders granted a delay to Brexit, people are increasingly hopeful they could still force a public vote. ""The message is clear"" A majority of MPs voted against holding another referendum on the issue earlier this month, and it remains a longshot bid by Remainers. But with the protest coming just days after EU leaders granted a delay to Brexit, people are increasingly hopeful they could still force a public vote. ""The message is clear: stop Brexit,"" said the leader of the Liberal Democrats Vince Cable, who led the march as it set off at lunchtime. ""We are now a Remain country. Nearly 90 percent of young voters who weren't allowed to vote in 2016 would vote to remain,"" he added. Science student Calypso Latham, 19, echoed the point. ""I was too young to vote in the last referendum,"" she told the BBC. ""It's going to affect my career with research grants so I definitely wanted to come and protest."" This week's agreed delay to Brexit, which was set for March 29, has prompted Prime Minister Theresa May to make a renewed bid to win MPs' backing for her divorce deal. If she succeeds, Britain will depart on May 22 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement the prime minister struck with Brussels last year. But if lawmakers defeat the accord again, as expected, London must outline a new plan or face a no-deal Brexit as early as April 12 -- unless it decides to request another extension and hold European Parliament elections in May. Organisers said about a million people opposed to Britain leaving the European Union joined what they called the ""Put it to the People"" march, descending on the capital by road and rail from across the country. ""Final say"" Called by the People's Vote pressure group, Saturday's protest follows a similar demonstration in October that drew an estimated half a million people. Organisers arranged hundreds of coaches and even chartered a train to bring protesters from all corners of the country to the capital. Stephen Goodall, a 96-year-old World War II veteran, travelled 200 miles (300 kilometres) by train from southwest England alongside four generations of his family including his great-granddaughter. ""I am an old man and the outcome won't affect me -- but it will affect my family and many people that I know for years to come,"" he said. May has repeatedly ruled out holding another poll on the issue, claiming it would renege on promises to honour the 2016 referendum result. Meanwhile the main opposition Labour Party appears divided on the issue, with some MPs in favour while others representing Leave-supporting areas in central and northern England are bitterly opposed. Watson, the deputy leader, said he had now decided to campaign for a referendum ""reluctantly"" and would only back May's deal if it was also put to the people. ""It can only begin to bring the country back together again if we all have a final say -- and then live with the result,"" he said. ""I trust the people I represent.

More Than 100 Tamil Nadu Farmers To Fight Polls Against PM From Varanasi,More Than 100 Tamil Nadu Farmers To Fight Polls Against PM From Varanasi,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lok-sabha-elections-2019-more-than-100-farmers-to-fight-polls-against-pm-narendra-modi-in-varanasi-2011770,en,"After taking their protests to the national capital to highlight their demands, Tamil Nadu's farmers are gearing up for an electoral battle and will file 111 nominations from the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is contesting. Tamil Nadu farmers' leader P Ayyakannu said Saturday that 111 farmers from the state will contest against PM Modi from Varanasi. Mr Ayyakannu, who is also president of the National South Indian Rivers Inter-Linking Farmers Association, said the decision to contest the polls from Uttar Pradesh was to urge the BJP to include in their manifesto their demands, including ""profitable prices for farm produce,"" would be fulfilled. Speaking to PTI, the leader, who spearheaded agitations in Delhi in 2017 for over 100 days, said the ""moment they assure in their manifesto that our demands will be fulfilled, we will drop our decision to contest against Modi."" In the event of that not happening, he said they would go ahead and contest against PM Modi. The decision to contest polls has the support of farmers everywhere and the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Mr Ayyakannu said. Asked why they were raising the demand with BJP alone and not other parties like the Congress to include it in their manifestos, he said the BJP was still the ruling party and PM Modi the Prime Minister. Parties like the DMK and the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam have assured full loan waiver, which is also one of the farmers'' demands, in their manifestos, he said. ""We are not against the BJP or our PM Modi. Before assuming power, Modi ji promised fulfilling our demands and assured to double our income. Even today he is our Prime Minister and the BJP is the ruling party and that is why we are making this demand to them."" The leader wondered as to what stopped the party from giving an assurance. Already, he said, he has booked train tickets for 300 farmers to go to Varanasi. Farmers from districts, including Tiruvannamalai and Tiruchirappalli, will reach Varanasi, he said. The BJP-led government at the centre had promised to fulfill their demands including profitable prices for farm produce, loan waiver from all banks including nationalised, and cooperative and Rs 5,000 pension for farmers over 60, Ayyakannu said. ""At the least, let the lone BJP MP from Tamil Nadu Pon Radhakrishnan commit that our promises will be honoured in the manifesto, we may think about reconsidering our decision,"" he said. In November 2018, farmers led by Ayyakannu had gone to Delhi with two ""skulls,"" to take part in a kisan rally, saying it belonged to their colleagues who had allegedly committed suicide over debt.

The agitators who had come from across the state claimed that a large number of teachers' posts were lying vacant but the authorities were not calling them for interview though they have the requisite qualifications. They said hundreds of candidates have passed the School Service Commission (SSC) recruitment examinations and found their names in the wait list for the past few years. Continuing the dharna on Mayo Road since February 28 under the banner of the SSC Yuva-Chhatra Adhikar Manch, many had fallen sick, affected by dengue and blood dysentery, said Tania Seth, one of the agitators. ""However, our movement will not stop till the vacant posts are filled,"" she asserted. Arpita Das of Raiganj and Subodh Halder of Birbhum had to be taken to hospital from the sit-in venue on Wednesday, a spokesman of the agitating organisation the SSC Yuva-Chhatra Adhikar Manch said Thursday. The Manch organised a mass convention on Wednesday near the venue where film maker Anik Dutta, actor Badshah Maitra criticised the state government for delay in recruitment of teachers. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the students' wing of the RSS, also slammed the authorities for doing precious little to end the impasse. Education Minister Partha Chatterjee had met the agitating students earlier this month and appealed to them to withdraw the stir but they refused to budge before getting specific assurances. Chatterjee had later said none of the eligible candidates would be deprived.

"Italy Bus Hijacker ""Heard Voices"" Of Drowned Migrant Children: Report","Italy Bus Hijacker ""Heard Voices"" Of Drowned Migrant Children: Report",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/italy-bus-hijacker-heard-voices-of-drowned-migrant-children-report-2011576,en,"The driver of a school bus who torched the vehicle to protest Mediterranean migrant deaths claimed on Friday he acted after hearing the voices of drowned children urging him on, media reports said. Insisting again that he did not want to hurt anyone, the 47-year-old of Senegalese origin, reportedly told investigators: ""I heard the voices of the children in the sea who were telling me 'do something spectacular for us without hurting the children'."" Earlier Friday other reports quoted Sy as saying he planned to use his young passengers as human shields and escape to Africa. ""I wanted to get to the runway at (Milan's) Linate airport using the children as human shields and from there head to Africa by plane,"" Corriere della Sera daily quoted Ousseynou Sy as telling investigators. Sy on Wednesday hijacked a bus while taking 12-13 year-olds from a gym to school in Crema, east of Milan. Armed with two petrol canisters and a cigarette lighter, he threatened the youngsters, took their telephones and told the adults to tie them up with electric cable. Their 40-minute ordeal ended when police managed to smash windows open and get those onboard out just as Sy set fire to the vehicle. He now faces having his Italian citizenship, obtained through marriage in 2004, revoked. According to the Corriere della Sera, Sy has told investigators he hates white people for having ""invaded and colonised"" Africa, forcing Africans to emigrate and ""die in the Mediterranean"". ""Africa rise up"" Alberto Nobili, head of Milan's counter terrorism police, said Sy had posted a video on Youtube with the message: ""Africa, rise up."" Media reports quoted him as saying he had no regrets as ""it was something I had to do and would do again, 100 times. Why did I do it? To send a signal to Africa"". He reportedly told investigators that Italy's impounding Tuesday of migrant rescue ship ""Mare Jonio"" off the Italian island of Lampedusa with 48 people aboard had been a tipping point for him. Quoting three students on the bus, Messagero daily reported Sy had first attempted a hijack on Monday, two days earlier. ""He tried to change the route but a teacher intervened and said 'what are you doing? Stick to the right route'."" That day, the trio said, Sy appeared very nervous, shouting insults at one child. The government, in the shape of deputy prime minister, Luigi di Maio, and far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, say Rome could now revoke Sy's passport. The debate has become increasingly heated in a country where Salvini's tough anti-immigration stance is popular with conservatives. In February last year, Italy was similarly rocked when far-right militant Luca Traini fired on a dozen African migrants in the central town of Macerata, injuring six. The attack was an apparent response to the killing of a young Italian woman, allegedly by a Nigerian drug dealer. Brenton Tarrant, accused of last week's Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, had scrawled Traini's name on one of his weapons. Anti-mafia state prosecutor Cafiero de Raho warned La Stampa daily the time had come to ""tone down"" the rhetoric, citing the danger of people further feeding on existing extremism and racial hatred.

Paris Police Ban 'Yellow Vest' Protests On Champs-Elysees On Saturday,Paris Police Ban 'Yellow Vest' Protests On Champs-Elysees On Saturday,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-police-ban-yellow-vest-protests-on-champs-elysees-on-saturday-2011466,en,"Paris police said Friday that ""yellow vest"" protests would be banned on the Champs-Elysees on Saturday, a week after hundreds of anti-government demonstrators rioted and looted shops on the iconic Paris avenue. Protesters will also be stopped from entering streets surrounding the Arc de Triomphe, at the top of the avenue, as well as several nearby areas, including the presidential Elysee Palace and the National Assembly, the Paris prefect's office said. ""There are serious reasons to believe that violence and damages are likely during the scheduled demonstrations,"" the office said. Similar bans were planned in other major cities, including Toulouse, in southwestern France, where officials said the main city square will be out of bounds for demonstrators. Protests will also be outlawed in much of the southern city of Nice, where Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Sunday. The Paris prefect's office said anyone defying the bans would face fines, part of tough new measures vowed by the government to prevent another flare-up of violence. In other areas of Paris, ""the right to demonstrate, which is a fundamental freedom, will be allowed"", but ""any riotous groups will be immediately dispersed,"" police warned. Last Saturday, police appeared to hang back as hundreds of violent protesters rampaged along the Champs-Elysees , burning and looting more than 100 businesses in unrest that cost the Paris police chief his job. Addressing the new Paris police chief Didier Lallement on Thursday, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner demanded a ""zero tolerance"" approach towards violent demonstrators. ""Black blocs belong in prison, not on the Champs-Elysees,"" he said, referring to the black-clad anarchists that overran the Champs-Elysees on Saturday. The weekly Saturday protests began on November 17 over fuel tax increases and quickly ballooned into an anti-government rebellion against Macron's policies , seen by the protesters as geared towards the rich. Although several of the initial protests ended in rioting, the clashes with police had eased as participation dwindled in recent weeks. Destruction of property is estimated to have cost 200 million euros ($227 million) so far over the 18 weeks of protests, according to Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire.

"Driver Hijacks, Sets School Bus On Fire In Italy, Children Escape Unhurt","Driver Hijacks, Sets School Bus On Fire In Italy, Children Escape Unhurt",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/driver-in-italy-sets-school-bus-full-of-children-on-fire-2010570,en,"A bus full of schoolchildren was hijacked and set on fire by its own driver on Wednesday in an apparent protest against migrant drownings in the Mediterranean, Italian authorities said. All 51 children managed to escape unhurt before the bus was engulfed in flames on the outskirts of Milan, Italy's business capital. Police named the driver as Ousseynou Sy, a 47-year-old Italian citizen of Senegalese origin. ""He shouted, 'Stop the deaths at sea, I'll carry out a massacre',"" police spokesman Marco Palmieri quoted Sy as telling police after his arrest. A video posted on Italian news sites showed the driver ramming the bus into cars on a provincial highway before the fire took hold. Children can be seen running away from the vehicle screaming and shouting ""escape"". One of the children told reporters that the driver had threatened to pour petrol over them and set them alight. One of group managed to call the police, who rushed to the scene and broke the bus windows to get everyone to safety. Palmieri said some children were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure because they had bruises or were in a state of shock, but none suffered serious injuries. A teacher who was with the middle school children was quoted by Ansa news agency as saying that the driver had said he wanted to get to the runway at Milan's Linate airport. An unnamed girl was also quoted as saying that Sy blamed deputy prime ministers Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio for the deaths of African migrants at sea. The United Nations estimates that some 2,297 migrants drowned or went missing in the Mediterranean in 2018 as they tried to reach Europe. A Libyan security official said on Tuesday that at least 10 migrants died when their boat sank off the Libyan coast near the western town of Sabratha. The Italian government has closed its ports to charity rescue ships that pick up migrants off the Libyan coast. Salvini says this has helped reduce deaths because far fewer people are now putting to sea. Human rights groups say deaths might have increased with hardly any boats now searching for the would-be refugees.

When the Bulgarian police tried to disperse them by using pepper spray, however, something quite unexpected happened - they managed to pepper spray themselves instead. Footage that has racked up millions of views on Twitter shows a police officer spraying directly into the air, failing to take into account the direction of the wind. As protestors remain largely unharmed, the pepper spray blows back into the faces of the police officers. Many cops were seen rinsing their eyes out with water in the viral clip. According to local reports , the incident took place outside the parliament in Sofia after protestors tried to block the streets. ""Bulgaria is a peaceful country, where protests very rarely go more violent than a bit of pushing. This explains the inexperience of the police with things like pepper spray,"" explained Jasper Neve, who shared the clip on Twitter. Watch the incident unfold below: Bulgarian police used pepper spray against protesters in front of parliament, but didn't take the wind direction into account pic.twitter.com/B8b7uQyIEG Since being shared online, the video has collected over 2.95 million views and thousands of reactions.

J&K Teacher Arrested For Alleged Links With Terrorists Dies In Custody,J&K Teacher Arrested For Alleged Links With Terrorists Dies In Custody,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-teacher-arrested-for-alleged-links-with-terrorists-dies-in-custody-2009816,en,"A teacher who was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir police in connection with a terror case died in custody. The incident has triggered protests in many parts of the state. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered to find out the cause and circumstances leading to his death. Rizwan Asad, a resident of Awantipore, Pulwama was a terror suspect, the police said. He was a arrested from his house. He died during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, the police added. The incident triggered massive protests and clashes in Awantipore as hundreds of students took to streets demanding action against those responsible for his death. The family of the victim said Rizwan Asad had no links with any terror group and they were being harassed just because they are supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami, an organisation banned by the government last month. Reacting to the incident, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah has demanded an exemplary punishment for the ""killers"" of the man. ""I had hoped custodial deaths were a thing of our dark past. This is an unacceptable development and must be investigated in a transparent, time bound manner. Exemplary punishment must be handed out to the killers of this young man,"" he tweeted. Midnight raids, crackdowns, rampant arrests, custodial murders, denial of democratic right to choose a government. Kashmir continues to suffer the fallout of the disastrous PDP-BJP alliance and from the Modi government's muscular approach to J&K. PDP leader Naeem Akhtar has also asked Governor Satya Pal Malik's administration to come clean on the incident. ""Disturbing reports of custodial death of youth from Awantipora in Srinagar's Cargo Camp. As per media he was picked up by NIA few days ago and was lodged in CARGO camp of (SOG). @jandkgovernor administration should come clean on this,"" Mr Akhtar, a former minister, wrote on Twitter.

Paris Police Chief Sacked After Champs-Elysees Rioting,Paris Police Chief Sacked After Champs-Elysees Rioting,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-police-michel-delpuech-chief-sacked-after-champs-elysees-rioting-2009577,en,"The French government sacked the top police official in Paris on Monday following another weekend of rioting in the capital during ""yellow vest"" protests which have put President Emmanuel Macron on the defensive. The police's failure to keep the Paris protests from spiralling out of control over the weekend again cast a harsh spotlight on their tactics. About 5,000 police were deployed in the capital on Saturday, far outnumbering the several hundred black-clad rioters who caused havoc in front of groups of often passive policemen for more than seven hours on the famed Champs-Elysees. Business owners were left fuming Monday, as Macron cut short his skiing holiday to meet top ministers to discuss the 18th consecutive Saturday of ""yellow vest"" demonstrations . ""The events of last Saturday, in particular on the Champs-Elysees, were unacceptable and the president asked the government to provide a response that was up to the needs of the situation,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a televised statement. After criticising ""inappropriate"" instructions on the use of rubber bullets given to security forces, he announced that the head of Paris police, 66-year-old Michel Delpuech, had been fired and would be replaced on Wednesday. He said French authorities would ban rallies on the Champs-Elysees and elsewhere if hooligans were detected there, adding that fines would be increased from 38 to 135 euros for people attending unauthorised protests. While the public's safety remains a priority, ""the outburst of violence justifies a firm (police) response,"" Philippe told France 2 television on Monday evening. Numbers down More than 100 businesses were damaged at the weekend in Paris including dozens of luxury shops and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees. Since the end of December, the number of ""yellow vest"" protesters has fallen, but each Saturday thousands still take to the streets, including far-right and far-left groups as well as anarchists who are responsible for much of the violence. A hard core of protesters have already vowed to cause havoc again next Saturday. ""Every Sunday large cities across France wake up to the same old story: smouldering barricades and a strident declaration from Christophe Castaner,"" leftwing daily Liberation wrote Monday. Some have called for French police to be far more active in tackling troublemakers. ""You have to take responsibility and engage, with the possibility that people will get hurt,"" said Frederic Lagache of the Alliance police union on Monday. For decades, French authorities have usually preferred the opposite, controlling mass protests with tear gas and rubber bullets while avoiding physical confrontation between police and large groups, experts say. Although some protesters have been injured by the rubber bullets, so far nobody has been killed in clashes with police, but officials say the risk would increase if officers charged the hostile crowds. ""They would rather see a building damaged, with insurance companies footing the bill, than risk direct contact between police and demonstrators that might cause serious injuries or death,"" said Olivier Cahn at France's Cesdip law enforcement research institute. 'Less reactive' But critics say the government needs to drastically rethink its approach for stamping out the rioting. ""There are techniques and strategies for separating violent demonstrators from the others,"" Cahn said. ""Germany has strategies for de-escalating the tensions and separating protesters that are quite effective."" Junior Interior Minister Laurent Nunez admitted on RTL radio on Monday that police ""were less aggressive, less reactive than usual"" over the weekend, promising a review of the instructions given to officers and their deployment. Castaner, a long-time ally of Macron who had no law-and-order experience before becoming interior minister in October, is also facing renewed scrutiny of his record amid calls for his resignation from some in the opposition Republicans party. While seen as too lax on Saturday, French authorities have been accused on other weekends of being too heavy-handed, highlighting the government's difficulty of managing the crisis. The UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet called for a ""full investigation"" into the possible use of excessive force by French police during the protests in an address on March 6. Since the demonstrations began on November 17, some 1,900 people have been hurt, including dozens who have suffered serious injuries from stun grenades or rubber bullets fired by police. Rights groups have tried to have the heavy rubber bullets used by the French police banned, noting that France is one of only a handful of Western countries to use them.

India Lodges Strong Protest With Pak Over Harassment Of Diplomats,India Lodges Strong Protest With Pak Over Harassment Of Diplomats,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-lodges-strong-protest-with-pak-over-harassment-of-high-commission-officials-2009545,en,"India has lodged a strong protest with Pakistan over several incidents of alleged harassment of Indian High Commission officials in Islamabad between March 8 and 11, and demanded an immediate investigation into them, official sources said on Monday. The Indian High Commission issued a ""note verbale"" to Pakistan Foreign Ministry on March 13, giving a detailed account of the incidents including tailing of India's Deputy High Commissioner, Naval Adviser and a first secretary on multiple occasions, they said. The sources said the deputy high commissioner was aggressively tailed by Pakistani security personnel on March 9 and 10 while the first secretary faced similar harassment on March 8. The Naval Adviser in the mission was subjected to aggressive tailing by Pakistani security personnel on March 8, 9, 10 and 11, they said. One Pakistani agency personnel was observed keeping surveillance outside the residence of the Indian Deputy High Commissioner on March 9 and 10. Sources said two Pakistani security agency personnel have been following the High Commissioner on a daily basis. In the note verbale, which is a diplomatic communication, the Indian High Commission has sought an urgent investigation into the incidents, saying such cases of harassment are violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. India's strong protest over the incidents came in the midst of severe strain in bilateral ties between the two neighbours. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after Indian Air Force fighter jets bombed terror group JeM training camp near Balakot deep inside Pakistan on February 26. Pakistan retaliated by attempting to target Indian military installations the next day. However, the IAF thwarted their plans. The Indian strike on the JeM camp came 12 days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which 40 soldiers were killed.

""We have good relations with Giriraj-ji. I got to know through the media that he is a little upset. I will call to ask if this is so, and if he is actually upset, I will try and resolve the issue,"" he said at a press conference here. However, Mr Paswan claimed that it was too late in the day to make any changes in the seat-sharing agreement. ""I do not wish to cause Giriraj-ji any grief, but I think we have gone too far now to revisit the decision,"" he said. The BJP had given Bihar's Nawada to the LJP on Sunday, offering the Begusarai seat to Mr Singh instead. The Union Minister, however, seemed far from happy. ""Why should I contest from Begusarai and not Araria?"" news agency IANS quoted him as saying earlier today. Many saw this as an indication that Mr Singh may not contest from Begusarai. According to IANS, the Union Minister had even announced last week that he wouldn't mind sitting out the elections if Nawada was not allotted to him. The state BJP, however, downplayed his protests. ""Giriraj Singh will abide by the party's decision... The LJP is likely to field Veena Devi, the sitting Munger parliamentarian, from Nawada,"" IANS quoted a party leader as saying on the condition of anonymity. The LJP will announce candidates for the six seats it will contest from Bihar by Wednesday. ""We are saddened by the demise of former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. It is a big loss to politics. As the nation is mourning his death, we are not going to announce the names of our candidates today,"" the news agency quoted him as saying at the press conference. According to news agency PTI, he also said that while the ruling alliance has already divided seats among its partners amicably, the grand alliance of opposition parties is nowhere near doing so. ""The so-called grand alliance has turned out to be an illusion,"" he said, asserting that the NDA will win over 350 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha in the upcoming elections. Under the National Democratic Alliance's seat-sharing arrangement in Bihar , the BJP and the Janata Dal-United will contest 17 seats each while the LJP fields candidates from six. The state has 40 seats in the Lok Sabha. (With inputs from Agencies) Get the latest election news , live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

Sister Anupama also expressed disappointment over the delay in filing the charge-sheet against Bishop Mulakkal. ""We witnesses are in extreme fear.

Policeman Among 2 Dead In Clashes At Vedanta's Odisha Aluminium Plant,Policeman Among 2 Dead In Clashes At Vedanta's Odisha Aluminium Plant,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/1-dead-as-police-clash-with-protesters-at-vedantas-odisha-aluminium-plant-2009431,en,"A protester and a policeman died in clashes outside Vedanta Ltd's alumina refinery in Odisha, a police official said on Monday, less than a year after police killed 13 anti-Vedanta protesters in Tamil Nadu. The incident in Odisha happened 10 months after police opened fire on demonstrators protesting against Vedanta's copper smelter in Tamil Nadu, killing 13 people. ""Two people have died - one of our Odisha industrial security force personnel and another one from the public,"" Gupteswar Bhoi, a senior police officer, told Reuters. Maheswar Pati, a protester, told Reuters the state's industrial security force personnel attacked the people without provocation. ""They physically assaulted us with sticks,"" Pati said. The state police-controlled Odisha Industrial Security Force said its staff were attacked by stone-throwing protesters. Pati said the demonstrators included people from three neighbouring villages who had surrendered land to Vedanta and hoped to secure jobs for locals in the company. Vedanta says 85 percent of the 3,000 employees at its Lanjigarh plant were from the state of Odisha. Ajay Dixit, Chief Executive of Vedanta's aluminium business, told Reuters that protesters disrupted production at the 1.9 million tonnes per annum refinery by blocking railway lines supplying bauxite and burning the front gate and other parts of the premises. ""As soon as the bauxite supply resumes, we will be able to operate at a normal capacity,"" Dixit said, without specifying a time frame for resumption of operations. The company, which plans to expand its refining capacity to 6 million tonnes per annum in India, expects to end the fiscal year 2018/19 with production of 1.5 million tonnes, compared with 1.1 million tonnes the previous year, he said. The protests, involving over a hundred people, were also sparked by the retrenchment of a local employee, a senior police official told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to media. Dixit said the employee was not fired, and had voluntarily resigned after the company initiated an investigation over compliance-related issues. The dead protester was a labourer who worked for one of Vedanta's contractors, Dixit said. Vedanta did not comment on what the demands of the protesters were, but said they wanted to resolve the situation through discussions. Dixit said the company was not intending to follow up on plans to mine bauxite in the contentious jungle-clad Niyamgiri hills of eastern Odisha, which tribes consider sacred. ""We are not dependent on Niyamgiri, we are not following up Niyamgiri,"" he said.

Indian-Americans Protest Against Pakistan For ''Sponsoring Terrorism'',Indian-Americans Protest Against Pakistan For ''Sponsoring Terrorism'',https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indian-americans-protest-against-pakistan-for-sponsoring-terrorism-2008856,en,"Hundreds of Indian-Americans protested against Pakistan over the Pulwama terror attack and urged the global community to hold Islamabad accountable for ""atrocities on minorities"" and ""sponsoring terrorism"". Around 300 Indian-origin people, highlighting the plight of lakhs of Kashmiri Pandits and accusing Pakistan of providing safe havens to terrorist groups, protested at the prime locations of Houston on Saturday noon. They termed the February 14 attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, in which 40 CRPF soldiers were killed, as an attack on India's sovereignty. Protestors carried banners like - ''Global Terrorist State - Pakistan'', ''Pakistan - Stop using terrorism as your State Policy'', ''Kashmir is Integral part of India - stop meddling'', ''Down with Pakistan'', ''Pakistan an architect of genocide and ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus and Sikhs'', ''Pakistan - take care of your minorities''. There was heavy sloganeering against Pakistan which protesters termed as a ""terror hub"". Earlier a press conference was held by Dr Veena Ambardar on behalf of Houston Chapter of Friends of India Society International and Houston Chapter of Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora, emphasising that India has suffered for the last 30 years a constant barrage of terror manufactured in Pakistan and unloaded on Indian soil, killing thousands of Indians. He said in front of local media that Pakistan is a terror state that has made business out of terror and has become a threat to the world peace. Addressing the press conference, Achalesh Amar, Coordinator of Houston Chapter of Friends of India Society International, highlighted the international ramifications of terror and role of Pakistan in exporting terror to the world and threatening the world civil society. He highlighted the role of Pakistan providing shelter to al-Qaeda leaders and providing safe haven and sanctuaries for dreaded terrorists to regroup and export terror machinery in other parts of the globe after the fall of Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. Amar stated how Osama bin Laden, an architect of 9/11, was found well protected in the garrison city of Pakistan. He said that the London bombings and shooting at San Bernardino, California had Pakistan connection. Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora members talked about the proxy war unleashed by Pakistan on India under Zia Doctrine in 1988 under the code word ''Operation Tupac''. They highlighted the operation''s salient features which encouraged cross border terrorism, guerilla warfare in India fully supported and led by Pakistan''s spy agency ISI and Army regulars. They made reference to Kargil where the nexus between Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, ISI and its army was exposed at the international level. The members said that this proxy war has costed India more than 6,000 of its security personnel besides heavy collateral damage. They accused Pakistan for the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus and Sikhs. ""More than 400,000 members were ethnically cleansed and are forced to live as refugees in India,"" they said. They urged the global community to hold Pakistan accountable for ""atrocities on minorities"" and ""sponsoring terrorism"". The events were organised by Achalesh Amar, Houston Coordinator of Friends of India Society International, USA and Dr Surinder Kaul, Global coordinator of Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora. Recently, tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir''s Pulwama district in February 14. In the wake of the Pulwama terror attack, India launched a major diplomatic offensive against Pakistan, holding briefing for envoys of 25 countries, including those from the five permanent UNSC members -- the US, China, Russia, the UK and France -- to highlight Islamabad''s role in using terrorism as an instrument of state policy.

Former IAS Officer Shah Faesal Launches New Party In Kashmir,Former IAS Officer Shah Faesal Launches New Party In Kashmir,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/shah-faesal-jammu-and-kashmir-peoples-movement-launched-by-former-ias-officer-2008903,en,"Former Kashmir bureaucrat Shah Faesal launched his political outfit -- the Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (JKPM) -- at an event in Srinagar on Sunday, two months after he quit government service in protest against ""unabated killings in Kashmir"". The party launch event took place at Gindun Park in Rajbagh area, which was festooned with banners and white flags carrying Mr Faesal's picture. In his address to the gathering, mostly comprising youth, the civil services topper-turned-politician admitted that he had initially arrived at an incorrect diagnosis of the Kashmir situation. ""When I joined the civil services 10 years ago, I believed that we can change the lives of people by providing roads, electricity and safe drinking water. But I have understood that as long as the youth in Kashmir live in a state of constant fear, and as long as our mothers and sisters face the prospect of losing their dignity and dear ones, nothing will work here,"" news agency IANS quoted him as saying. Mr Faesal, a self-confessed admirer of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it is natural for people to "" discredit a new idea or understate a revolution"" that's still in the making. ""Some say we are agents of the army. I'm ready to face all criticism, but our pursuit to usher in a new tomorrow will continue undeterred,"" he said. The objectives of JKPM were ""to work towards establishing an inclusive and pluralistic society with adequate political representation for under-privileged communities; promoting sustainable development strategies; building a progressive, gender-sensitive political institution with traditional values and modern sensibilities; uplifting marginalised communities; and establishing transparent, corruption-free politics in Jammu and Kashmir"", IANS quoted him as saying. In a Facebook post put up on the day of his resignation in January, Mr Faesal claimed that ""Muslims had been reduced to second-class citizens"" in the country. He also hit out against the centre, accusing it of subverting public institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the National Investigation Agency to fulfill its political needs. Since then, the former bureaucrat has been building up a support base among the Jammu and Kashmir youth and gathering public support for his initiative towards ensuring ""corruption-free, clean and transparent"" politics in the state. Although National Conference chief Omar Abdullah had sent feelers to him back then , Mr Faesal clarified that he does not intend to join any of the mainstream political parties in the state.

But a petition against it has gathered more than one lakh signatures - as many citizens say it would not be worth the loss of thousands of trees, the expense and the disruption. They suggest more focus on public transport like buses and the suburban railway.

We are saying we still don't know what the project is. You can't call a tender to build a house when you still don't have a proper plan. We found out that the tender has been ready for two years.

They have gone in a pole-vault from - somebody gave an idea to a tender. Even the DPR and feasibility report has not been released in public. It has not been approved by the cabinet."" Actor Arundhati Nag was also at the protest and she said, ""It is haphazard. We have to think ahead. We have to plan it. We can't just connect one side of the city to the other. Improve public transport - then people will stop using their private vehicles. Tax vehicles more."" The state government has been trying different methods to improve travel through the city - but mega-projects have often become controversial. A plan for a steel flyover on the route to the airport that would have involved cutting many trees was vigorously opposed and later scrapped. It is estimated that the Elevated Corridor project would involve the loss of at least 3000 trees.

"Paris Luxury Stores Looted, Burned In ""Yellow Vest"" Riots","Paris Luxury Stores Looted, Burned In ""Yellow Vest"" Riots",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-luxury-stores-looted-burned-in-yellow-vest-riots-2008739,en,"Rioters looted and torched shops and businesses on the famed Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris on Saturday, on the 18th weekend of French ""yellow vest"" protests, characterised by a sharp increase in violence after weeks of dwindling turnout. President Emmanuel Macron cut short a skiing trip in the Pyrenees to return to Paris for a crisis meeting, as hooded protesters went on the rampage in Paris, leaving a trail of destruction in the touristic heart of the city. The police appeared overrun as protesters swarmed the Champs-Elysees, vandalising and later setting fire to Fouquet's brasserie, a favourite hangout of the rich and famous for the past century -- as well as luxury handbag store Longchamp, a bank, another restaurant and several news stands. The rioters also looted several clothing stores and set fire to barricades in scenes reminiscent of the worst yellow-vest riots in Paris in December. French anti-riot policemen stand outside the restaurant ""Le Fouquet's"" which was partially burnt down on the Champs-Elysees in Paris ""Like the vast majority of French people, I feel very angry today,"" tweeted French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who visited the scene. ""Today's actions are not the work of protesters, but of looters, arsonists and criminals. No cause justifies this violence,"" he added. In a statement, the national police denounced the ""mindless violence, cowardly attacks"" and stressed their determination to guarantee public order against ""provocateurs and vandals"". Bank blaze Saturday's turnout was seen a test of the ongoing strength of the movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes and quickly ballooned into a rebellion against Macron's policies, seen by the protesters as geared towards the rich. In recent weeks, the protests have dwindled in size. But the interior ministry estimated the turnout in Paris Saturday at 10,000, out of around 32,300 nationwide. That is a fraction of the 282,000 people they said took part in the inaugural demonstrations across France on November 17, but more than the previous weekend. Saturday's protests were markedly more violent than in recent weeks. Police said close to 240 people were arrested, while prosecutors said more than 100 had been taken into custody. Jewellery that was partially destroyed and looted during clashes between Yellow Vest protesters and riot police forces on the Champs-Elysees in Paris The bank set alight was on the ground floor of an apartment building, and fire firefighters had to quickly evacuate the residents, including a nine-month-old baby. Eleven people suffered minor injuries in the bank blaze, the fire service told AFP. The violence left 17 members of the police injured, and 42 protesters, said police. 'Ultra-violent' minority Macron was due to hold an emergency meeting at the interior ministry on Saturday evening, his office said. The rally coincides with the end of the public debates called by the president to try take the heat out of the protests and give voters a forum to propose policy changes. Around half a million people turned out at townhall-style meetings held around the country over the past two months. But many ""yellow vests"" dismissed the consultation exercise as a smoke-screen. Outside the restaurant ""Le Fouquet's"" set on fire during clashes with riot police forces on the Champs-Elysees in Paris On Saturday, the police used tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon to try repel protesters who gathered at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe war memorial, which was sacked by protesters on December 1. But for seven hours they continued to be pelted with paving stones by mostly black-clad demonstrators. ""There are a number of people who have come just to smash things,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said, estimating that some 1,500 ""ultra-violent"" activists had infiltrated the crowd. ""We have been too nice, that's why it's violent today. I'm not in favour (of violence) but we are ruled by corrupt people who dare to lecture us,"" Jean-Francois Bernard, a landscape gardener who was among the protesters, told AFP. The presidency later announced that Macron was returning home from La Mongie ski resort where he and his wife Brigitte arrived Thursday to spend the weekend. A statement from his office said he would attend a crisis meeting on the violence at the interior ministry later Saturday. 'We want results' Protesters streamed into the capital by train and car for a rally they called an ""ultimatum"" to the president. Over 5,000 police were deployed, along with several armoured police vehicles. Macron was caught off guard when grassroots protesters began occupying traffic roundabouts in November over fuel taxes. He has loosened the state's purse strings to the tune of 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) to try defuse the protests. Destroyed Hugo Boss shop window on the Champs-Elysees in Paris But the measures failed to quell the anger of the demonstrators, who accuse the former investment banker of being elitist and favouring the rich. The Paris protest was one of several in the capital on Saturday, where tens of thousands of climate campaigners also held a demonstration to demand that the French government uphold its commitments on reducing emissions. Yellow vest protests also took place several other French cities. At Bordeaux, in the southwest, police clashed with protesters and a bank was damaged.

Vedanta's Sterlite Copper Appoints New CEO Amid Battle To Reopen Smelter,Vedanta's Sterlite Copper Appoints New CEO Amid Battle To Reopen Smelter,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vedantas-sterlite-copper-appoints-new-ceo-amid-battle-to-reopen-smelter-2008368,en,"Vedanta Ltd on Friday named metals industry veteran Pankaj Kumar as Sterlite Copper chief executive, amid struggles to reopen its smelter in Tamil Nadu that was shut last May after police killed 13 demonstrators protesting against the plant. Sterlite Copper, which operates a 400,000-tonne-per-year smelter in Thoothukudi, was forced to shut its plant by Tamil Nadu in May 2017, and is estimated to have lost more than $200 million since. Mr Kumar replaces P Ramnath, who led Sterlite for eight years. Under Mr Ramnath, the smelter was ordered shut at least twice, including for an alleged gas leak in 2013. Local residents and environmental activists have staged protests against the plant over allegations of pollution as well as the earlier gas leak. Vedanta says the claims of pollution are false, without any factual basis. It also denied being the source of the gas leak. The chief executive replacement comes amid a drawn-out legal battle over the smelter that could be complicated further by the national elections that start on April 11. The two main political parties in Tamil Nadu are against reopening the smelter, increasing the likelihood that the shutdown will continue. Vedanta won a judgment in December from the National Green Tribunal that would have cleared the way to reopen the smelter, but the Supreme Court ruled in February that the environmental court did not have jurisdiction over the smelter. ""My tenure as the CEO has been an eventful journey, and as is the case with any journey, there have been numerous ups and downs,"" Mr Ramnath, who will continue as an advisor to the company, said in a statement. Mr Kumar, who will also oversee operations at Vedanta's Malco Energy Limited and Fujairah Gold, has worked at Hindustan Zinc, Tata Steel and Adani Ports, in a career stretching over 29 years. Mr Kumar was also chief operating officer at Sterlite Copper in the past, the company said.

A Boss menswear store and the upscale Fouquet's restaurant -- a brasserie popular with politicians and film stars - were among the premises to have their windows smashed by groups of hooded demonstrators in scenes reminiscent of the worst ""yellow vest"" riots in Paris in December. The demonstrators also set fire to a bank situated on the ground floor of an apartment building, which was engulfed by flames. The fire service evacuated the residents and extinguished the blaze. Eleven people, including two fire fighters, suffered minor injuries, according to BFM news channel. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner in a tweet accused the arsonists of being ""neither demonstrators, nor trouble-makers"" but ""murderers."" The protests came a day after President Emmanuel Macron arrived in the southwestern Pyrenees mountains with his wife Brigitte for a short ski break, an AFP photographer reported. ""I'm going to spend two to three days here to rest and rediscover landscapes and faces that are dear to me,"" Macron told La Depeche du Midi newspaper. 'Ultra-violent' minority Saturday's turnout is a test for the ""yellow vest"" movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes and quickly ballooned into a anti-government rebellion but has struggled lately to mobilise large numbers of protesters. Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17. The rally coincides with the end of the public debates called by President Emmanuel Macron to try take the heat out of the protests and give voters a forum to propose policy changes. Around half a million people turned out at townhall-style meetings held around the country over the past two months, But many ""yellow vests"" dismissed the consultation as a smoke-screen. The police on Saturday used tear gas and water cannon to repel protesters who gathered at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe war memorial, which was sacked by protesters on December 1 in scenes that drew international condemnation. A newsstand also went up in smoke as groups of mostly black-clad demonstrators pelted the security forces with stones and erected barricades. ""There are a number of people who have come just to smash things,"" Castaner said, estimating that some 1,500 ""ultra violent"" activists had infiltrated the crowd of ""between 7,000 and 8,000"". On social media, ""yellow vest"" leaders had hinted at the arrival of sympathisers from Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and even Poland. ""Macron, we're coming to get you at home,"" some of the protesters chanted, referring to the presidential palace situated near the Champs-Elysees. Forty-four people had been arrested by the early afternoon, the police said. 'We want results' From early morning protesters began pouring into the capital by train and car from around the country for what they called an ""ultimatum"" to Macron. Over 5,000 police were deployed, along with several armoured police vehicles, and several metro stations were closed. Macron, who was caught off guard when grassroots protesters began occupying traffic roundabouts in November over fuel taxes, has loosened the state's purse strings to the tune of 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) to try defuse the protests. He also travelled the length and breadth of the country, engaging in marathon debates with local politicians and voters. But the measures failed to quell the anger of the demonstrators, who accuse the former investment banker, of being in the pocket of the rich. Laurent Casanova, an engineer who was among the protesters on Saturday, told AFP he wanted to mark the end of the debates. ""We have been patient but now we want results,"" he said. The protest was one of several planned in Paris on Saturday, where climate campaigners also gathered in their thousands to demand Macron go further on greening the economy.

She had earlier been issued two warning letters. In its notice, the Franciscan Clarist Congregation accused Sister Lucy of leading a life which was against the ""principles of religious life"" and the rules of the congregation. She has been asked to give an explanation to the Superior General Sister at Generalate of the Congregation before April 16, news agency PTI reported. Sister Lucy said she is saddened by the church's accusations. ""I joined the church when I was 17. I have lived a life following all the principles of religious life. I don't have any other life. My reply to the second warning letter earlier was very clear. I have explained my stand,"" she was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. The nun had received two warning letters from her superiors in the Catholic Church in January. In the first warning letter, she had been asked to explain why she had acquired material possessions and belittled Catholic faith. The congregation has termed as ""grave violations"", Sister Lucy's obtaining a driving license, buying a car and publishing a book without permission and knowledge of her superiors. It also objected to her participation in TV discussions and writing of articles for non-Christian newspapers. Bishop Mulakkal is accused of raping a nun on 14 occasions from 2014 to 2016.

Poll Panel Will Keep Delhi Police Out Of Probe Over Misleading Calls: AAP,Poll Panel Will Keep Delhi Police Out Of Probe Over Misleading Calls: AAP,https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/election-commission-ec-will-keep-delhi-police-out-of-probe-over-misleading-calls-aap-2008589,en,"The AAP Friday claimed the Election Commission agreed to its demand of keeping the Delhi Police out of a probe into BJP allegations that the ruling party hired call centres for making ""misleading"" calls to voters. A joint meeting between an AAP delegation, Delhi Police and EC was held after a party workers'' protest outside the poll panel office. AAP members, led by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, alleged that ""politically motivated and illegal"" raids were being conducted on call centres hired by the party to make people aware that their names had been deleted from voters' lists. After over three hours of protest, Mr Sisodia and AAP's Lok Sabha poll candidates Atishi and Raghav Chadha were called by the EC for the joint meeting. Emerging from the EC premises after three rounds of meeting, Mr Sisodia told reporters the commission ""seriously"" listened to AAP's complaints on the raids. ""The raids were conducted to harass call centre employees, including women who were made to stand,"" he alleged. ""The EC has agreed to hold a probe into the call centre issue without the involvement of the police, which was our demand earlier,"" Mr Sisodia told reporters. However, there was no immediate response from the EC. During the meeting, the AAP delegation said the successive raids gave an indication ""it was (a ploy) to help the BJP,"" Mr Sisodia alleged. The AAP has been alleging ""deletion"" of names of 30 lakh voters, particularly those from Purvanchali, Muslims and Bania communities, since the 2015 assembly election in Delhi and attacking the BJP claiming it was behind it. Mr Sisodia said they also informed the poll panel that the police take action on reports of such calls, but when voters raise issues about their names missing from the electoral list, no action is taken. In Delhi, the polls are scheduled to be held on May 12. ""We are responsible for making those calls to tell the public about their name deletion. Telling people about their right is not a crime,"" Mr Sisodia said after the meeting. He alleged that a raid on a call centre was conducted barely an hour after he met Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora Friday. His delegation met the CEC to lodge a complaint against the Delhi police which, he claimed, was acting on the behest of the BJP to harass call centre employees. Satish Golcha, special commissioner of police (Crime and EOW), said an FIR following complaints regarding the ""bogus calls"" was registered and investigation is underway. ""As far as the allegations against us (Delhi Police) are concerned, we have already responded to the EC about them. Moreover, no call centre owners have filed a complaint regarding harassment by our team,"" he said. ""Relevant facts of the matter are being ascertained. The investigation is being conducted strictly in accordance with the law. Nobody has been arrested in the case so far. We are ascertaining facts from the call centres from where such calls have been made,"" he added. Sources said call centre employees are being questioned to ascertain who gave them the work of making the calls, how did they procure data of the people and on what basis were they making claims about deletion of their names. A BJP team had earlier met Mr Arora and alleged the AAP was making these ""misleading"" phone calls. The EC had directed the police to take ""necessary action"" against people making such calls. The AAP leaders asserted as they hired the call centres, the police should question them not the workers. During an earlier meeting with Mr Arora, Mr Sisodia had urged the EC to direct Delhi Police to stop the ""harassment"" of the call centre employees. Mr Sisodia alleged the Delhi Police raids were ""politically motivated and illegal"". Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal also questioned the CEC. ""Why is CEC raiding our call centres and asking for our data? What is our crime? Pl tell our crime at least,"" he said in a tweet. Meanwhile, AAP volunteers led by respective MLAs and Lok Sabha candidates on Friday burnt copies of the BJP's 2014 Lok Sabha manifesto for Delhi in all 70 assembly seats. AAP Delhi convenor Gopal Rai said Friday's action has shown that people of Delhi are no longer ready to bear the injustice being meted out to them since last seven decades. Mr Rai said if AAP wins all seven parliamentary seats in the upcoming elections then it will ensure that Delhi is granted full statehood. AAP volunteers now plan to take the statehood movement to the next level by burning the BJP manifesto in all 272 wards of Delhi on Sunday, he said.

After sitting for over three hours outside the Election Commission in protest, Mr Sisodia and Lok Sabha candidates Atishi and Raghav Chadha were called by the Election Commission to hold a joint meeting with police officials. After the meeting, Mr Sisodia said, ""We are responsible for making these calls to tell the public about their vote deletion. Telling people about their rights is not a crime."" Mr Sisodia has alleged that a fourth raid on the call centre, hired by the AAP, was conducted barely an hour after he met Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora on Friday. His delegation met the CEC to lodge a complaint against the Delhi police which, he claimed, was acting at the BJP's behest to harass call centre employees. ""After our meeting with the CEC, we were assured that he will look into the matter but within an hour we see that a fourth raid is conducted on the call centre,"" he said. Special Commissioner of Police (Crime and EOW) Satish Golcha said an FIR was filed following complaints regarding bogus calls about the Delhi's electoral rolls and investigations are underway.

An FIR was also filed in this matter. The AAP leaders asserted that they were responsible for hiring the call centre employees to make people aware that names had been deleted from voters' lists and the police should question the leaders instead of the workers. The AAP alleged that BJP got more than 30 lakh voters' names deleted in Delhi. When the Aam Aadmi Party started talking about this issue and hired a call centre to inform voters about it, the BJP got rattled and ordered the Delhi police to harass the call centre employees, the party alleged. During the earlier meeting with the chief election commissioner, Mr Sisodia urged the poll panel to direct Delhi police to stop the harassment of the call centre employees. ""The Delhi police is working like goons. We urged the EC to stop the Delhi police from doing it. They (Delhi police) are pressuring and harassing the call centre employees,"" Mr Sisodia said. He alleged that these raids by the Delhi police are politically motivated and illegal conducted at the behest of the BJP. He said this is the fourth raid on the call centre in four consecutive days.

""Climate change is worse than Voldemort,"" read a handmade sign carried by one student in Wellington, referring to the evil wizard in the hugely popular Harry Potter books and films. ""The oceans are rising, so are we,"" read another in Sydney. Student protests in capitals and cities from Wellington to Melbourne and Sydney drew tens of thousands of people, with more demonstrations planned later in the day in Asia, Europe and the United States. The worldwide student strike movement started in August 2018, when 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg began protesting outside her parliament on school days. She has since been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. ""If we don't do something, it'll be our lives affected, not the 60-year-old politicians,"" said Sydney student Callum Frith, 15, who was wearing his school uniform. ""We need action."" Elsewhere in Asia, about 60 students protested at government house in the Thai capital of Bangkok, holding cardboard signs to campaign against plastic. Thailand is one of the world's top marine plastic polluters. ""As youths who will inherit the land, we gather here to demand that the government work with us to solve these problems,"" said 17-year-old Thiti Usanakul, of student-led group Grin Green International. The group was later invited to meet officials at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in two weeks. In the South Korean capital of Seoul, more than 100 students held recycled cardboard signs with slogans such as ""Too Warm 4 School,"" and ""Don't deny climate change"". ""I think environmental education should be mandatory from elementary school,"" said 15-year-old high school student Bang Tae-ryung. ""Although we learn, we should know more about why it's happening and how we can resolve the problem."" In the wealthy city state of Singapore, where strict laws regulate public assembly, young people planned a virtual campaign on social media. ""The government just needs to change some things, which is why, if we go on strike on a school day, then they'll notice and they might actually do something,"" said 14-year-old New Zealand student Inese, who did not want her full name used. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has pledged NZ$100 million ($68 million) to cut greenhouse gas emissions, supports the strikes, saying teenagers should not wait for voting age to use their voices. That contrasts with politicians in Australia and Britain who have rebuked them for cutting class. ""For action on issues that they think is important, they should do that after school or on weekends,"" Dan Tehan, Australia's education minister, told reporters ahead of protests in Melbourne. Wellington parent Alex, who marched beside his 11-year-old son, disagreed. ""It's a much better day of education,"" he said. ""This is the greatest issue of our time."" Scientists say fossil fuel use releases greenhouse gases that trap heat and lift global temperatures, bringing more floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels. The 2015 Paris climate conference pledge to limit the rise to 2 degrees C (35 F) requires a radical cutback in use of coal and fossil fuels.

Mr Naidu's son Lokesh too will be fighting his first electoral battle from Mangalagiri constituency in the Amravati capital region.

The Election Commission had asked Delhi Police to take ""necessary action"" against those making ""misleading"" phone calls to people about the city's electoral rolls, following which an FIR was registered. A BJP delegation met the Chief Election Commissioner and alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party was making such phone calls. The AAP leaders have been alleging that police have been harassing the call centre employees in the matter for which Atishi and Chadha met Delhi Police officials to lodge their protest over the matter. Mr Chadha, while addressing the media outside the police headquarters, alleged that ""the BJP in the past four years has been trying to destroy the AAP"". A senior police official said they are probing the matter and are questioning the call centre employees to ascertain the nature of calls allegedly made by them to voters. ""The people who fund AAP are being harassed by authorities and they are being probed because they support AAP. The agency which AAP uses for ensuring fair elections is being harassed too. This is because BJP is scared about it,"" Mr Chadha said. Atishi, in a series of tweets, lashed out at Delhi Police and the BJP. ""BJP got more than 30 lakh votes deleted in Delhi and when Aam Aadmi Party started talking about this issue in the media the Election Commission removed this list from their website!,"" she said in a tweet. ""Aam Aadmi Party went door-to-door to check this list and found wrongful voter deletions on a very large scale. We then hired a call centre to inform voters about their names being deleted from voter list,"" she said. Alleging that voter deletion is a strategy being used by the BJP for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Atishi said this is what happened in Telangana too. ""Voter deletion is a strategy that is used by the BJP in elections! This is exactly what happened in Telangana, where it was brought to light by badminton player Jwala Gutta, whose name was wrongfully deleted from voter list,"" she tweeted. ""The BJP is now worried that their strategy is being exposed! So they are now using Delhi Police to intimidate the call centres that have been hired by Aam Aadmi Party to inform voters about voter deletion. Call centres hired by Aam Aadmi Party are being harassed and intimidated by Delhi Police; they are being called everyday to the Crime Branch for questioning. They are now being taken for questioning to police headquarters,"" she alleged. ""Since BJP's strategy of voter deletion has been exposed, they are now trying to use Delhi Police to harass call centres! When Aam Aadmi Party is saying openly that we have hired the call centres to inform voters, then why are call centres being called for questioning?"" Atishi said in another tweet. ""BJP knows that they are going to lose in the upcoming general elections, so now they are trying to intimidate call centres who are working with opposition party,"" she said. ""If BJP and Delhi Police think that anything illegal has been done, then why don''t they question Aam Aadmi Party? Why are they trying to intimidate call centres working with Aam Aadmi Party? Is it so that call centres get scared of working with opposition parties,"" she said in another tweet. Sanjay Singh, a senior AAP leader, has urged Delhi Police to take action against these police officials ""harassing"" the call centre employees.

Hundreds March In Paris As Childminders Join 'Yellow Vest' Protests,Hundreds March In Paris As Childminders Join 'Yellow Vest' Protests,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hundreds-march-in-paris-as-childminders-join-yellow-vest-protests-2005476,en,"Hundreds of ""yellow vest"" protesters began marches in Paris on Saturday, marking the 17th straight weekend of anti-government demonstrations despite attempts by French President Emmanuel Macron to quell discontent with a nationwide series of debates. Protesters wearing the neon high-visibility vests that have come to symbolise the movement were joined by others donning pink tops, as child-care workers turned out against a reform of their unemployment subsidies. Other gatherings were planned on Saturday in several French cities such as Bordeaux and Toulouse as well as smaller towns such as southerly Puy-en-Velay. Some demonstrators staged a ""flashmob"" at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, waving French flags and dancing in one of the terminals, television footage on BFM TV showed. What started out last November as a backlash against Macron's plan to hike fuel taxes -- part of his bid to push a cleaner energy model -- has morphed into a broader movement decrying the government as out of touch with the hardships faced by some households and low-income workers. Some demonstrators staged a ""flashmob"" at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, waving French flags and dancing in one of the terminals Turnout has dwindled since nearly 300,000 people took part in road blockades and marches across France on November 17, coming in at 39,300 last Saturday according to the interior ministry. But protesters have carried on nonetheless, with few signs of a halt in demonstrations any time soon. The latest turnout figures were not yet available. Mr Macron, who dropped the fuel tax increase and budgeted an extra 10 billion euros ($11.24 billion) to help the poorest workers, has also sought to defuse the unrest with a series of town hall-like meetings across France. Consultations with local representatives are due to draw to a close next weekend, coinciding with calls by some 'yellow vest' campaigners to up the pressure on the government throughout March. The movement has no single leader. After protests descended into riots in December, recent demonstrations been largely peaceful. Some 54 per cent of French people backed or had sympathy with the 'yellow vests', an Ifop poll taken on March 7 and 8 for online news site Atlantico showed on Saturday. That was up from 50 per cent in mid-February but down from a peak of 72 percent. Mr Macron's popularity has also improved in recent weeks. An Ipsos poll released on March 6 showed his ratings improved by 8 percentage points since December of 2018, to a 28 per cent approval level.

Ernest Quintana received the news last Monday in a hospital in Fremont when a doctor appeared on-screen and told him. He passed away the following day. ""That Robot Dr. May be ok for some situations but not to tell a Man he is going to Die,"" a family friend wrote in a Facebook post that included a screenshot of a video taken by the patient's granddaughter, Annalisia Wilharm. Wilharm was alone with her grandfather when the doctor remotely told Quintana that his lungs were failing and he would not be going home. ""We knew that it was coming and that he was very sick, but I don't think somebody should get that news delivered that way. It should've been a human being come in,"" Wilharm told local TV station KTVU. As her grandfather had a hearing problem, she had to relay the news, KTVU reported. The Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, where Quintana was being treated, responded in a statement carried by US media in which it offered condolences to the family but disputed the characterization that the news was delivered by ""robot."" ""The use of the term 'robot' is inaccurate and inappropriate. This secure video technology is a live conversation with a physician using tele-video technology, and always with a nurse or other physician in the room,"" Kaiser Permanente said.

""If we stop, the world stops."" Armed with this slogan, Spain's largest unions CCOO and UGT organised a two-hour work stoppage -- the first starting at midday -- while smaller unions have called for a 24-hour strike. Madrid Mayor Manuela Carmena, prominent journalists, nuns and company employees are among hundreds of women who have pledged to take part in a strike that seeks to recreate an unprecedented two-hour work stoppage that took place on the same day in 2018. It was as yet unclear how many women were participating. International Women's Day is being celebrated around the world today, with marches and other actions expected. Hundreds of protests and gatherings are planned across Spain. In Barcelona, demonstrators blocked a major thoroughfare, some wearing purple wigs -- the colour long associated with gender equality. Unions, feminist associations and left-wing parties are hoping to draw hundreds of thousands of people in big marches later in the day in Madrid and Barcelona. As snap general elections near on April 28, women's rights has become a crux theme of left and right-wing parties' election campaigns, with all pledging to do their bit for inequalities. Protesters shout slogans while holding signs during a demonstration in Madrid. (AFP) The gender pay gap stands at 14.2 percent according to the latest EU statistics, two points below the EU average. And gender violence continues to take its toll on women, with 47 killed by their partners or ex-partners last year and at least 975 dead since 2003, according to government figures. ""Us women need to be seen, because there is still a lot of work to do,"" Ana Pastor, the conservative parliament speaker, told Spanish television. ""Women don't have real power."" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has made women's rights one of the central themes of his campaign, tweeted that he wanted ""a feminist Spain."" ""Only with feminism will we end violence against women and achieve real equality,"" he said. Spanish media is awash with stories about women's rights and gender inequality. On Thursday, the national police force announced it was working on a ""non-sexist language guide for its agents."" Dissenting Voices But there are increasing dissenting voices against what some conservative groups believe has gone too far. The conservative Popular Party won't take part in the Madrid protest, considering the manifesto that called the demonstration ""unacceptable."" This calls on people to mobilise ""in the face of the right and far-right that have placed us women and migrants as a priority target of their ultra-liberal, racist and patriarchal offensive."" Centre-right party Ciudadanos, meanwhile, has lashed out at what it considers an attempt by the left to appropriate feminism to get more votes on April 28 general elections. Student protesters shout slogans during a demonstration in Barcelona. (AFP) The ""Women of the World Global Platform,"" a Spanish initiative that groups together conservative associations from around the world, has also called for a counter-protest in central Madrid on March 10. International Women's Day ""has converted into a day for those who reject femininity as well as masculinity, complementarity, maternity and dedication to the family,"" spokeswoman Leonor Tamayo said in a statement. Small far-right party Vox, which opposes a law against gender violence that it feels is ""ideological"" and ""discriminatory"" towards men, has also been gaining ground. Pastor, though, retorted that ""this is not about parties."" ""There are thousands of women in Spain who don't vote, who don't identify with parties...

The tribals are protesting a Supreme Court order evicting more than 10 lakh tribal families and other forest-dwellers from forest lands across 16 states. The Bharat Bandh has also been called against University Grants Commission's new 13-point roster system that will reduce jobs for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes. The Bharat Bandh is being supported by several teachers' association across India and various political leaders. Samajwadi Chief Akhilesh Yadav, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav and Gujarat independent MLA and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani tweeted their support for Bharat Bandh.    जो आरक्षण को हाथ लगाएगा, वो ज़िंदा जल जाएगा। #BharatBandh Bharat Bandh Impact In Bihar: Hundreds of Dalits, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and tribal outfits stopped rail and road traffic across Bihar on Tuesday as part of Bharat Bandh. The protesters stopped over a dozen long-route trains in Ara, Jehanabad, Patna, Darbganga, Bhagalpur, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, and Begusarai railway stations. Various important arterial roads were also blocked. The shutdown is supported by the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, Rashtriya Lok Samta Party, Hindustani Awam Morcha, Left parties and other opposition members. ""The state administration has made elaborate security arrangements in view of the shutdown,"" said a senior government official. Bharat Bandh Impact In Other States In Delhi, the protesters are set to march from Mandi House to Parliament Street. Tribals in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other states will also join the Bharat Bandh. The Supreme Court had last month ordered eviction of the families that have not been able to prove their rights over the land they lived in, and had been tagged as illegal residents by the state governments. The order was part of an ongoing case, where the petitioners, mostly wildlife activists, wanted illegal forest dwellers out of forest land to reduce man-animal conflict and restore equilibrium. After uproar and Centre's intervention, the top court has put a freeze on its order.

Three policemen were soaked through with it,"" Rudy Manna from the Alliance police trade union in the southern port city of Marseille told AFP. One policeman also suffered an elbow injury when hit by ""a poop-filled projectile"", Marseille police headquarters said. Similar incidents took place in the southern city of Montpellier, police trade union representatives said.

Saturday marked the 16th straight weekend of ""yellow vest"" demonstrations in France since November, which have often seen security forces targeted with stones and other projectiles.

Egyptian Photojournalist Released After More Than 5 years in prison,Egyptian Photojournalist Released After More Than 5 years in prison,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/egyptian-photojournalist-released-after-more-than-5-years-in-prison-2002480,en,"An award-winning Egyptian photojournalist was freed on Monday after serving more than five years in prison on charges of attending an Islamist protest in 2013. Mahmoud Abu Zeid, also known as Shawkan, had been in custody since August 14, 2013, when he was arrested while covering the Muslim Brotherhood sit-in at Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya Square, reports Efe bews. ""Shawkan is free,"" according to a post on the Freedom for Shawkan Facebook page. Mr Shawkan also posted an image celebrating his release on his Twitter account. The photojournalist's lawyer Taher Abu al-Nasr told Efe that Shawkan was released at around 6 a.m. from a police station in the district of al-Haram, Giza. Mr Shawkan won the 2018 Unesco/Guillermo Cano Press Freedom Prize, which was announced in Ghana on World Press Freedom Day on May 2, 2018. His lawyer told Efe that the photojournalist would be placed on probation for another five years, meaning he will need to report to a police station each night after sunset, although those restrictions could still be adjusted by the Ministry of Interior. Several human rights organisations such as Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International have condemned Shawkan's arrest. Hundreds of people were killed during the 2013 sit-in, which came after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.

Indian-Americans Protest Outside UN Headquarters Against Pulwama Attack,Indian-Americans Protest Outside UN Headquarters Against Pulwama Attack,https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indian-americans-protest-outside-un-headquarters-against-pulwama-attack-2002317,en,"Indian-Americans held a protest in front of the United Nations headquarters in US' New York against the Pulwama attack and demanded that Pakistan take action against terror groups operating on its soil. On February 14, a terrorist of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a bus in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district, killing 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel. The protesters from across New York gathered at the UN headquarters on Sunday, holding placards and raising slogans against the terror machinery operating on Pakistani soil and demanded swift action against the JeM and its leader Masood Azhar. Jagdish Sewhani, President of The American India Public Affairs Committee and one of the organisers of the event, told news agency PTI that Indian-Americans, including professionals and students, were expressing their anger at the ""continued state sponsorship of terrorism by Pakistan across the world"". The protestors raised slogans against all major terrorist attacks originating from Pakistan such as the 2008 Mumbai 26/11 attack, the Uri attack and the 2001 Parliament attack among others. The message to Pakistan is that ""enough is enough. This time we will not forgive and we will not forget,"" Mr Sewhani said. Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party-USA President Krishna Reddy Anugula said the Indian community in the US strongly condemns the ""dastardly"" attacks. ""We are demanding that the perpetrators of the attack should be brought to justice and the terror infrastructure based in Pakistan has to be dismantled,"" he said, adding that JeM chief Azhar should be handed over to India to face a trial. ""We are protesting Pakistan's cross-border terrorism in India and Afghanistan and sponsorship of global terrorism that has affected many countries around the world,"" Mr Anugula said. Several people from other South Asian nations such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal also joined the protest. Richard Benkin, a Jewish-American at the protest, said the international community stood in solidarity with India, noting that Pakistan's support for terrorism will not go unquestioned any longer. The crowd raised slogans and held placards with messages reading 'Handover Masood Azhar-Global Terrorist', 'Pakistan Stop Harbouring Terrorists' and 'Pakistan Export Goods not Terrorism'. Protestors also spoke about the high casualties resulting from terrorism supported and launched from the Pakistani soil. They demanded that the UN make Pakistan accountable for the Pulwama, Mumbai and other terror attacks. They also demanded that Kulbhushan Jadhav be set free. The protesting organisations also plan to send a memorandum of their demands to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Pramod Bhagat, President of India World Foundation USA, said that there was a need to reach out to the US lawmakers.

"France's ""Yellow Vest"" Protests March For 16th Straight Week","France's ""Yellow Vest"" Protests March For 16th Straight Week",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/frances-yellow-vest-protests-march-for-16th-straight-week-2001815,en,"""Yellow vest"" protesters marched in cities across France for a 16th straight week on Saturday in a bid to keep up pressure on French President Emmanuel Macron in demonstrations again marred by vandalism and violence. In Paris, a man was reportedly hit in the face by a rubber bullet fired by a controversial riot control weapon, while in the southwestern city of Bordeaux an MP accused police of assaulting him. About 39,300 people protested nationwide, including 4,000 in Paris, according to the interior ministry -- down on the 46,600 turnout announced the previous weekend. The official figures are regularly disputed by protest organisers, who argue the government is trying to portray the movement as losing support. But at least one demonstrator in the capital appeared to acknowledge their numbers were falling. ""We are less numerous than usual, but we are there anyway and that's essential,"" said pensioner Murielle, adding: ""We won't give up because the situation is not going to improve, that's for sure."" Regarding the possible police shooting of a man with a so-called defence ball launcher, known by the French abbreviation LBDs, Paris police chief Michel Delpuech said ""an internal administrative investigation has been opened"". The weapons fire 40-millimetre rubber projectiles, considered non-lethal, but have been blamed for serious injuries to a number of demonstrators. Macron last week rejected a call from rights watchdog the Council of Europe to suspend their use. The 'Hard Core' Elsewhere in the country, in Bordeaux, an MP from the far-left France Unbowed party, Loic Prud'homme, said police had assaulted him with batons on the edges of a march and that he had filed a formal complaint. The local regional governor insisted police had intervened to stop protesters taking an unauthorised route and had done their job correctly. In the western city of Nantes, police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon to disperse demonstrators, some of whom hurled projectiles including petrol bombs and bottles containing acid. ""There has been a lot of damage... bus shelters, a bank branch, a travel agency, a business,"" said Claude d'Harcourt, a regional governor for the Nantes area. There was also trouble in Nice, Strasbourg and Lille, where protesters marched carrying signs and banners, including ""Macron accomplice of the worst scum, finance"" and ""stop capitalist militias"". Police used teargas elsewhere in the country, including at protests in Bordeaux, Morlaix, Arles and Lyon. ""Those who are still in the street today will never give up, it's the hard core,"" said one demonstrator at the Lyon protest, a farmer from the region. 'We Are Still Here' On Friday, Macron had repeated a call for calm after weeks of ""unacceptable"" outbreaks of violence. The protests have also seen spates of vandalism with monuments defaced, businesses damaged and cars set alight. Macron has pledged 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) in response to anger over the high cost of living, including tax cuts for some pensioners and measures to boost low wages. He has also spearheaded a ""grand national debate"" by way of the internet and town hall meetings to gather opinions on how the country could be reformed. This week's demonstrations had been billed by organisers as a prelude to a ""big month"" of protests to mark four months of the ""yellow vest"" movement and the end of the debates championed by Macron. Many yellow vest activists dismissed the debates as a platform for Macron rather than a forum for real discussion. The protests, which have no organised leadership and are named after the fluorescent vests that French drivers must keep in vehicles, began on November 17 over increasing fuel taxes -- later reversed by the government. They quickly grew into a broader anti-government rebellion over anger towards Macron. Eleven people have died in events linked to the protests since they began. The number of those attending the weekly rallies has dropped since 282,000 turned out on November 17.

""What I said in my speech was I criticized Modi and I will continue to do so. If that's a crime, I am ready to go to jail,"" Mr Balakrishnan told the media. The BJP's Kerala unit on Wednesday demanded the arrest of Mr Balakrishnan for his alleged anti-national remarks. Mr Balakrishnan said on Tuesday that the aerial attack conducted by India was a ploy by the BJP-RSS combine to derail the general election process. He added that the Modi government, instead of resolving the Kashmir issue, was trying to make the people of Jammu and Kashmir ""enemies"". ""When I was speaking that day, TV news channels were present and everyone can check the video of my speech,"" added Mr Balakrishnan. He added that the statement of Karnataka BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa that the aerial attack on the JeM terror camp in Pakistan would help the party win more seats showed how the BJP politicizes things. ""The attack (by IAF) is not a credit for the BJP. The entire credit should go for the brave Indian forces and not to one individual. The entire nation stands with the forces,"" he said.

The protest comes just weeks after 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed in a suicide attack on a convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14. Several others have been killed since then in encounters with terrorists. ""If an Army man dies, his family gets his salary till the time he would have ideally served and his full pension also after that.

Earlier today, a CRPF soldier died due to injuries that he suffered in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's Kupwara . On Saturday, two CRPF soldiers were killed in shelling across the Line of Control in the Poonch district. ""We leave our families, our parents and work in all corners of the country.

Hurling flags and banners, the ex-servicemen also demanded that soldiers posted in tense areas be given special allowances. Their other demands include wider access to government healthcare services and access to subsidised canteen services like the Army.

Once one of Pope Francis' closest advisors, Pell is facing up to 25 years in prison for five charges of sexual and indecent assault on two choirboys in 1996-97, and is expected to be remanded in custody after the pre-sentencing submissions in court. His lawyer plans to apply for bail later in the day before the Court of Appeal. A large crowd greeted the cleric outside the County Court of Victoria in Melbourne, with supporters of other abuse survivors jostling the 77-year-old and yelling: ""You're a maggot, Pell, you rot in hell."" ""You're the devil. You're evil... You're a paedophile. You're a criminal. You're a monster. May you rot in hell,"" one protester shouted. Shortly before Wednesday's hearing, Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti announced on Twitter that Pell had been removed from his position as chief of Vatican finances, the third-most powerful position in the Church. Pell was convicted in December of assaulting the two choirboys in the sacristy of Melbourne's Saint Patrick's Cathedral, but the verdict was only revealed Tuesday after a second trial against him was abandoned by prosecutors, allowing a gag order to be lifted. Pell has already appealed the verdict. He is expected to be sentenced in the next two weeks. The Court of Appeal process, which could last up to a year, will see a bench usually made up of three judges review the same evidence that the jurors were presented with in the earlier trial. Criminal law expert Jeremy Gans of the University of Melbourne told AFP the judges could question the jury's conclusions based on the fact that the case was based on only one person's -- the surviving victim's -- testimony. The other choirboy, who died of a drug overdose in 2014, had never told his parents he was abused. The Catholic Church meanwhile could face a civil suit from the father of the deceased victim, who said via his lawyer Tuesday that the cleric had ""blood on his hands"". He said his son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, turned to drugs as a teenager to cope with the trauma and also suffered from PTSD. ""We are looking at what knowledge the Church might have had in relation to what was happening,"" the lawyer, Leanne McDonald, told AFP.

The minister also claimed he wasn't aware of deployment of additional companies of the ITBP and the CRPF in the state capital, fuelling speculations of a rift within the Pema Khandu-led government. ""I am deeply shocked to learn about the death of three youths, but none of them was killed in police firing. I had directed DGP SBK Singh and SP (Itanagar) M Harsh Vardhan to arrest trouble mongers,"" Mr Waii said. Protests had broken out in Itanagar and Naharlagun town on Saturday after the ruling BJP government announced that it was considering issuing permanent resident certificate (PRC) to six non-Arunachalee communities, prompting the administration to clamp curfew and suspend internet services. The agitation, which raged on for three days despite the curfew, subsided after Chief Minister Pema Khandu announced Monday that his government wouldn't pursue the issue any longer. An official said the curfew was lifted Tuesday morning but the internet services continued to remain suspended for the fourth consecutive day. Mr Waii said people should cooperate with the police to ensure their safety and security. He added that it wasn't possible to pin blame on any particular group or community for the protests. Asked about Chief Minister Pema Khandu's decision to constitute a peace committee, Mr Waii said he would follow instructions as and when he was asked to. The Home Minister added that he had sent messages to the Chief Minister, requesting him to call a cabinet meeting. He said he wasn't officially informed about the meeting.

Deaf Protesters End Stir In Pune After Government Concedes To Demands,Deaf Protesters End Stir In Pune After Government Concedes To Demands,https://www.ndtv.com/pune-news/deaf-protesters-end-stir-in-pune-after-government-concedes-to-demands-1999804,en,"The State Level Association of the Deaf (SLAD), which had been spearheading a protest in Pune since Monday over issues related to hearing impaired youths, today called off the agitation after the Maharashtra government accepted some of its key demands. Maharashtra Minister of State for Social Justice Dilip Kamble today met the agitators in Pune, and told them that the state government has decided to accept their key demands pertaining to education and jobs. Several hearing-impaired youths, who were staging a demonstration on Monday outside the Social Welfare Commissionerate in Pune for their pending demands, including the right to quality education and provision of trained interpreters for deaf students, were injured after police lathi-charged them. After the lathi-charge, the protesters continued with their protest outside the Social Welfare Commissionerate. Talking to reporters after the meeting, Dilip Kamble said, ""Chief Minister Devandra Fadnavis said in the (legislative) assembly today that a decision on the key demands will be taken immediately and on February 28, a meeting in the presence of CM will be held in which all the officials from Social Welfare Ministry and departments will participate."" SLAD secretary Pradip More announced that the agitation has been called off and the next course of action will be decided after a meeting with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on February 28. ""We are partially happy, but need to see how things unfold in the coming days. We are hopeful that our all the demands will be accepted by the government,"" he said. SLAD president Manoj Patwari said they were told that Mr Fadnavis would hold a meeting with them on Thursday. ""If all the demands are not met during that meeting, we will not back off...we will boycott voting in the coming elections,"" he said. ""We need to see whether the assurance given by the government is going to be implemented or not,"" Mr Patwari added. Mr Kamble said, ""Majority of their demands, such as getting a driving licence, appointment of sign language interpreters in various departments, setting up special education institutes from Class I to Class XII in Nashik and Latur and preferences to specially-abled people, including the deaf, in jobs, have been accepted."" Mr Kamble also said that an inquiry committee has been formed to probe the lathi-charge incident. ""After receiving the inquiry report, a decision will be taken...There is a fear among the youth that cases will be registered against them, but I would like to assure that no such cases will be registered against them,"" he said. The agitators had alleged that police baton-charged them despite their peaceful protest, while the police claimed they used only mild force as protesters blocked roads and disrupted traffic for immediate resolution of their demands. Earlier today, the Maharashtra government expressed regret in the state Legislative Council over the police baton-charge on the hearing impaired students. Replying to a demand by Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council Dhananjay Munde to suspend the errant policemen, Revenue Minister Chandarakant Patil said an inquiry had been instituted into the incident. The Shiv Sena, a constituent of the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, demanded a judicial probe. Chandarakant Patil, who is the leader of the Upper House, said, ""The demands of the students are being discussed. We are positive about fulfilling them. Arrangements are being made to bring the students here. Action would be taken against those responsible (for the lathi-charge)."" NCP leader Dhananjay Munde said if demands of the students were fulfilled at the district level itself, the protest need not have happened. He alleged that the government was busy issuing advertisements, while the youth were demanding jobs. Shiv Sena MLC Neelam Gorhe demanded a judicial probe into the incident, claiming that the police would suspend some of its personnel who would then approach the MAT (Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal) and resume office.

Scores of farmers, under the banner of ''Kisan Astitva Bachao Andolan'', have been protesting outside the authority office in Sector 6 since February 12. Some farmers launched the indefinite fast on Monday. ""They have not shown any seriousness towards resolving our issues. The ethics have died. That is why we resorted to indefinite strike,"" Sukhveer Singh, convenor of the Andolan, told PTI. Eight farmers, including Singh, are on the indefinite fast. Singh said throughout Tuesday there has been no communication between the protestors and the officials over the issue. ""It''s already been 36 hours and we are outside the authority office. There has been no correspondence of any kind. They don''t care about our issues,"" he claimed. There was no response by the Noida Authority to telephone calls and text messages by PTI. The farmers are demanding residential plots 10 per cent the size of the total land that was acquired from them by the authority post 2002. They are also demanding an increased monetary compensation for the acquired land. Among other demands, the protestors, including those from Behlolpur, Sarfabad, Hoshiarpur and other villages of Noida, want a college and a play field to be developed in Sector 123.

Thousands had gathered outside the social welfare commissioner's office, stressing ""deaf community in Maharashtra has had enough."" Police began to disperse these people, hit them with batons when they tried to take out a rally, Pradip More, Secretary, State Level Association of the Deaf (SLAD), the NGO that organised the protest, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He claimed some of the protesters were injured, while several others were detained. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has now sought a report in the matter from Pune Police Commissioner K Venkatesham. In a Facebook post, the Metro South Asian Deaf Association, an organisation of deaf people from South Asian countries, sharing a video of the protest, said ""deaf community in Maharashtra has had enough"". ""It is high time, the government provides accessibility and quality education to deaf people,"" the post read. The protesters also sought setting up of government schools and colleges for the specially-abled. Over 18 lakh deaf youth in the state have decided not to vote in the forthcoming general elections unless they get an assurance from the state authorities, Mr More was quoted as saying by news agency PTI A first information report or FIR has been filed against over 2,000 protesters under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including rioting.

At least 13 people were killed in the operation in Thoothukudi. The non-lethal bullets were ""too less to have been effective"", the report accessed by NDTV through a Right to Information or RTI request, said. Twelve of the 13 protesters killed when police opened fire on May 22, 2018 were hit by bullets in the head or chest, and half of those were shot from behind, autopsy reports had said earlier. Based on media reports, the National Human Rights Commission or NHRC had ordered a probe into the alleged use of excessive force by Tamil Nadu Police. Based on Delhi High Court's direction, the NHRC also sent their investigation team to Thoothukudi to probe the allegations. The NHRC team conducted submitted its report to the commission last year. The NHRC probe team found that ""non-lethal bullets used were too less to have been effective"" and also called for a ""detailed investigation on quantum of force used to control the crowd at individual places."" Despite this, the NHRC decided to close the case saying the Tamil Nadu government-constituted ""Judicial Commission is already looking into the allegation of excessive use of police force, hence no further intervention needed."" ""The location of injury on the head and vital organs on upper part of the body of the deceased / injured does appear to give some credence to the allegation of excessive and indiscriminate use of firepower,"" the NHRC report said. But the report also said, ""The situation could have become worse and led to loss of human lives if force had not been used."" Though 1,182 police personnel, including the Inspector General of Police Southern Sector, were put in place to deal with the situation, the NHRC team found that the ""administration underestimated the turn out of the people and the extent they might go"". In total, 26 tear gas shells, 18 rubber bullets and 25 plastic bullets were used before 69 rounds of live ammunition, by the police over one hour and fifteen minutes, the report added. Thirteen people were killed and more than 100 were injured including 30 with gunshot injuries, it said. Police rules in India allow the use of live ammunition to counter civil unrest, but say that the response should be proportionate and officers should not shoot to kill. Police Standing Orders for Tamil Nadu say that, when using firearms, ""aim should be kept low, preferably well below the waist level, and directed against the most threatening part of the mob"". The firing in Thoothukudi was the deadliest at an environmental protest in India in a decade. A working group of United Nations' human rights experts in May condemned the ""apparent excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force by police"". The Central Bureau of Investigation or CBI is investigating the shootings, which took place as protesters were marching to the local government headquarters in the port city, demanding that the Sterlite copper smelter controlled by London-headquartered Vedanta Resources be shut for allegedly polluting the environment. No police officers have been arrested or charged in connection with the killings. In a statement following the incident the Tamil Nadu state government, which is responsible for the police, said: ""Due to unavoidable circumstances, we had to take action to bring the situation under control.""

Mr Khandu sought cooperation of all organisations for restoring peace in the state capital. He said there is food shortage, and people in need of medical care are being deprived; businesses, schools and colleges are shut. He asked the groups to help create a good atmosphere in the city for normal life to resume. Expressing pain at the loss of three lives, he expressed condolences and said their families will be adequately compensated, including the injured. He announced Rs 20 lakh and a government job for the family members of those who died in the violence, and up to Rs 10 lakh for those injured.

In remarks made in Nagpur earlier this month, Mr Rao described the RSS as one of the most secular and inclusive organisations and said it has always respected the right of individuals to practice their own faith. Expressing displeasure over the remarks, opposition members stayed away from the Central Hall where the governor delivered his address to the joint sitting of both the Houses on the first day of the budget session. Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Dhananjay Munde said they decided to boycott the address because they ""were doubtful if it will be the governor's address or that of a RSS person"". ""A governor's post is constitutional. We had doubts whether his speech was going to be in the interest of the state or the RSS. Hence, we decided to boycott it,"" he added. NCP's group leader in the Assembly Jayant Patil told reporters outside the House that the opposition had taken the decision to protest Mr Rao's support to the RSS, ""which sows the seeds of divisiveness"". ""A governor's post is constitutional and his remarks were unwarranted. The governor supports the RSS. The promises made by the governor have remained unfulfilled, so we have decided to boycott his speech,"" Mr Patil said. Before the governor could begin his speech, opposition parties staged a protest against Mr Rao's remarks at the steps of the Vidhan Bhavan. Some opposition members also raised slogans against the BJP-led state government. On Sunday, opposition parties boycotted the customary tea party hosted by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on the eve of the interim budget session. They said the state government should not announce any ""populist"" or policy decisions during the six-day session. The vote-on-account, which will have budget provisions till July 31, will be tabled on February 27.

Mr Rijiju also said the Pema Khandu-led BJP government in the state should take all possible steps, including initiating dialogue with the civil society, to bring normalcy as early as possible, as there was confusion on the issue of granting Permanent Residence Certificate (PRC) to six communities. ""There is no question of imposition of President's rule. The state government should immediately work for restoring peace and bringing back normalcy. The protests took place as the state government could not communicate properly to the people on the issue of PRC,"" he told reporters here. Mr Rijiju also denied that there was any move to replace Chief Minister Pema Khandu by the ruling BJP. The Congress has demanded the chief minister's resignation and the imposition of President's rule in the state. At least three people died during violent protests over granting the PRC to six non-Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe (APSTs) communities living in Namsai and Changlang districts -- Deoris, Sonowal-Kacharis, Morans, Adivasis and Mishings -- and to the Gorkhas living in Vijaynagar. Most of these communities are recognised as Scheduled Tribes in neighbouring Assam. Mr Rijiju, who is from Arunachal Pradesh, said the state government should give compensation to those who were killed and those who received injuries. ""The Home Minister (Rajnath Singh) and I have spoken to the Governor and the Chief Minister and told them that peace must be prevailed and adequate compensation should be given to the victims of police firing,"" he said. The union minister of state for home also blamed the Congress for ""politicising"" the PRC issue and said the Narendra Modi-led central government has done tremendous work for the development of Arunachal Pradesh as well for the entire Northeastern region and all such initiatives should not go in vain due to protests and violence. ""Arunachal Pradesh is a peaceful state and its people are peace loving. The state government should talk to all concerned people and organisations so that peace and harmony come back. I am told the situation is now under fully control,"" he said. Army patrolled the streets of Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar Monday as people gathered on streets defying curfew despite the chief minister's assurance that grant of PRC to six non-native communities in the state was a ""closed issue"". Curfew that was clamped in Itanagar and adjoining Naharlagun town on Saturday, but it did not deter protesters from venturing into the troubled streets that were scene of pitched battles with security forces over the last three days that left three people dead, including two in police firing on Sunday. No major incident of violence has been reported from anywhere since Monday morning as Arunachal Scouts, an infantry regiment of the Army trained in mountain warfare, marched through the streets of the two towns to instill confidence among people and ward off possible violence, officials said.

Internet continues to remain suspended in Itanagar and Naharlagun amid the indefinite curfew. Arunachal Pradesh witnessed massive violence for three days from Friday over the Joint High Power Committee (JHPC) recommendation granting permanent resident certificates (PRC) to six communities who are not natives of the state but have been living in Namsai and Changlang districts for decades. Arunachal Pradesh Chief Secretary Satya Gopal issued a statement on Sunday that said: ""Considering the present situation pertaining to grant of PRCs to non-APST (Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribes) of Namsai and Changlang districts, the state government has decided that no further action will be taken in grant of PRCs ."" There was no report of violence from anywhere in the state on Monday but shops and market establishments in Itanagar and Naharlagun were closed, police said, adding that central paramilitary forces sent to help the state administration in maintaining law and order have reached Itanagar. Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said the state government has decided to not accept the recommendations of a high-level committee to grant permanent resident certificates to six communities, and blamed the Congress for ""instigating"" a section of the people. In separate tweets, Mr Rijiju said the Arunachal Pradesh government has passed an order to not accept the recommendations of the Joint High-Powered Committee to grant PRC to six communities living in Namsai and Changlang districts. On Sunday, two people were killed and three injured when protesters tried to attack the private home of Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu at the ESS sector in Itanagar in the afternoon. Mr Khandu had called an all-party meeting yesterday to take stock of the situation and decide on the future course of action, but none of the parties, including the opposition Congress, NPP and the PPA, turned up. Sources in the chief minister's office said the meeting has been rescheduled on Monday. The agitators have been demanding a permanent resolution to the PRC issue, immediate resignation of the chief minister, unconditional release of protesters (numbering around 40) and immediate transfer of the chief secretary, among others. Protesters allegedly set on fire the private home of Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein and vandalised the office of the deputy commissioner here on Sunday, police said.

As many as 60,000 acres of the protected forested area is likely to become available for construction purposes soon, with the Haryana government all set to table an amendment to this effect in the ongoing assembly session. People of all ages, from teenagers to senior citizens, gathered at Khushbu Chowk with placards and banners before taking out a two-kilometre march against the planned legislative move. ""If they want real estate development, there are lots of other places for it. You have to know which areas to protect and which places to build structures. We are not saying no to development, but it should not come at the cost of destroying the Aravallis. It will lead to the destruction of both air and water quality in the area,"" Vineeta Singh, one of the protesters, said. A study of the Aravalli hills in southern Haryana by the Wildlife Institute of India a few years ago identified it as India's most ""degraded"" forest range . The study, conducted between January and April 2016, found that ""most of its indigenous plant species have disappeared... and the most serious threat to wildlife and forests is development activities, which are gradually destroying its remnants"". The protesters said that development should not come at the cost of the country's precious resources. However, the Haryana government is now likely to bring an amendment to the Punjab Land Preservation Act-1900, which protects large portions of the Aravalli foothills. Once passed, it will be possible for realtors to take up construction activities on 60,000 acres of the forest land - affecting large areas of Gurugram and Faridabad. The forest cover in Haryana comes up to just 3.59%, the lowest in the country. Participants of the march also highlighted the effect such an action would have on people's health. ""Pollution levels are already high, even with the Aravallis intact. Things will get much worse if it is destroyed. People tell me not to live in Gurugram, but that can't be the solution. What we need is a sustainable development approach,"" said Sameexa Sud, a Class 12 student. Fitness enthusiasts in Gurugram stand to lose an irreplaceable venue for trail runs and bicycling events if the Manohar Lal Khattar government goes ahead with the amendment. ""I come here twice a week with my friends to cover a distance of 30-40 km on bicycle. This attempt to allot 60,000 acres for construction purposes poses a big threat to the very concept of healthy living. There will be no space to jog and cycle, and pollutants in the air will only multiply,"" said Ali Masudi, another resident, adding that 90% of the people cannot afford PM2.5 masks. The protesters claimed that they met Haryana Forest Minister Rao Narbir Singh, who assured them that their objections will be taken into account.

Violence had erupted during a 48-hour shutdown declared by student and civil society bodies to protest against the Pema Khandu government's decision to table a Joint High Power Committee (JHPC) report on giving permanent residential certificates to non-native scheduled tribe communities of Namsai and Changlang district in the state assembly. Police resorted to firing in order to quell the protests against the move, with agitators pelting stones at government vehicles and offices. A man who tried to enter the civil secretariat here was killed in the police action, and another suffered a bullet injury in his leg. Several security personnel and agitators were also injured in clashes that broke out in Naharlagun. Congress president Rahul Gandhi condoled the man's death in a late-night tweet. ""I'm sorry to hear about the death of an innocent youth in police firing, in Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh, in which many others have also been injured. My condolences to the family of the young man. I pray that the injured make a speedy recovery & that peace returns to Arunachal,"" he posted. Public gatherings have been restricted in the region to prevent further violence, and the government has decided against tabling the report for now in view of the volatile situation. The government has also suspended Internet services in the region for the next 24 hours with immediate effect to prevent the spread of rumours on social media platforms. The Army has been called in to conduct a flag march. Eighteen student bodies and civil society groups had organised the shutdown to mount pressure on the state government to scrap the decision of granting permanent residential certificates to non-Arunachal scheduled tribe communities of Namsai and Changlang districts. The agitating groups allege that the JHPC -- headed by Environment and Forest Minister Nabam Rebia -- has submitted its report without verifying the facts properly, and it should be rectified before being tabled in the assembly.

The All India Kisan Sabha or AIKS, backed by the CPI(M) or Communist Party of India (Marxist), announced suspension of the 180-km march from Nashik to Mumbai after a three-and-a-half hour meeting of its representatives with state ministers Girish Mahajan and Jaykumar Rawal. The farmers had embarked on the march on Thursday morning, but it was called off later. ""The meeting (held on Thursday) yielded positive results. We will suspend the march now,"" AIKS president Ashok Dhawale told news agency Press Trust of India after the meeting between the two sides at Ambebahula village in Nashik. This is the second time in the last one year that farmers were on the roads to protest against their alleged ""betrayal"" by the governments at the centre and the state. Earlier, they had planned to launch the march on Wednesday but it was deferred by a day allegedly after the state police stopped scores of farmers approaching Nashik from districts like Thane, Palghar and Ahmednagar. This is the second time in one year that farmers were on the roads to protest In a late night meeting on Wednesday, the AIKS had asked the government to give its assurances in writing, a demand Mahajan agreed to. Girish Mahajan had held parleys on behalf of the Devendra Fadnavis dispensation. The AIKS, however, had decided to proceed with its march from Nashik till the government kept its word. Accordingly, the third round of meeting was held Thursday. AIKS representatives had held the first meeting with the government on February 17 ahead of the launch of the long march. According to AIKS president Ashok Dhawale, around 50,000 farmers from Nashik, Thane, Palghar, Ahmednagar and other districts of Maharashtra had taken part in the march. Mr Dhawale said the farmers will again launch the protest in case the government failed to keep promises made in writing. The meeting was also attended by CPI(M) legislator JP Gavit. Mr Dhawale said the government has given in writing that the ministers and AIKS representatives will take stock of the implementation of assurances every two months. ""Such meetings did not happen over the past year. Now, they have given it in writing that these meetings will be held to review progress of implementation,"" Mr Dhawale added. Besides accepting the demands raised by the farmers, the AIKS said the government has assured that water flowing in Maharashtra's rivers like Nar, Par, Damanganga and Pinjal will be transferred to the Godavari basin through lift irrigation and used in drought-hit areas of the state. ""The meeting went for three-and-a-half hour. The concerns raised by the AIKS representatives were conveyed to the chief minister. ""The meeting was positive.

The UNSC, comprising 15 permanent and non-permanent members including China, said in the statement that it ""condemns in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly suicide bombing in Jammu and Kashmir, which resulted in over 40 Indian paramilitary forces dead and dozens wounded on February 14, 2019, for which Jaish-e-Mohammed has claimed responsibility. It also said that ""all states must, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, cooperate actively with the Government of India and all other relevant authorities in this regard."" Sources say these bits of the text, which India proposed through its partner countries, were opposed vehemently by China as it repeatedly tried to block the statement for 6 days. China, say sources, did not want a reference to Jaish-e-Mohammed and insisted on including ""India-administered Kashmir"" in the text.

After the Pulwama attack, Beijing had taken a day to express ""deep sympathies"" to the families of the 40 CRPF men. In its condolence message, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi had said his country ""resolutely opposes and strongly condemns all forms of terrorism"", but avoided any reference to Pakistan. The resolution adopted unanimously by the UNSC including China reaffirmed that ""terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice."" It also reiterated that ""any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed."" Over 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14. India has launched a diplomatic offensive to isolate Pakistan in the international community for its support to terror groups and cross border terrorism. In a major boost to New Delhi's efforts to get Jaish chief Masood Azhar on the list of global terrorists, France is expected to soon move a proposal in the Sanctions Committee. It will be the fourth such attempt at the UN in past 10 years. China has always blocked it.

"Clashes Break Out On Venezuela Border, Police Fire Tear Gas","Clashes Break Out On Venezuela Border, Police Fire Tear Gas",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/clashes-break-out-on-venezuela-border-police-fire-tear-gas-1998296,en,"Venezuelan troops fired tear gas at angry protesters unable to cross into Colombia on Saturday after President Nicolas Maduro closed the border to stop the opposition bringing U.S. humanitarian aid into the South American nation. Demonstrators set up barricades and burned tires in the Venezuelan border town of Urena, as attention turned to whether National Guard troops stationed at the border crossing would fulfill Maduro's orders to block humanitarian aid from reaching a sick and hungry population. Four National Guard troops at the frontier disavowed Maduro's socialist government on Saturday, following an appeal from Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to let aid through. A social media video showed the troops driving armored vehicles across a bridge linking the two countries, knocking over metal barricades in the process, and then jumping out of the vehicles and running to the Colombian side. ""Among the troops, whether they are in the army, air force, navy or National Guard, many people disagree (with what is happening),"" one of the troops, an officer whose uniform carried the name Linarez, told reporters after entering Colombia, according to another video on social media. ""You can't say anything against the government. It's treason."" Colombia's migration authority confirmed the defection of the four Venezuelan soldiers. Leaders of Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party call the aid effort a veiled invasion backed by Washington, and insist that the United States should instead help Venezuela by lifting crippling financial and oil sector sanctions. Venezuela's opposition says that while the need for basic food and medicines is desperate, the aid operation is also meant to embarrass military officers who continue to support Maduro's increasingly isolated government. Demonstrators in Urena who blocked roads and burned tires also threw rocks at security forces who responded with volleys of tear gas. The troops had earlier blocked people from crossing the border into Cucuta, where many Venezuelans now work, shop or send their children to school amid Venezuela's continued economic collapse. ""We were all going to work. We want to work: the people attempted to force their way through,"" said Viviana Meza, 29, who works in a Cucuta restaurant. Guaido, recognized by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate head of state, defied court orders not to leave the country when he traveled on Friday to Cucuta, where aid from the U.S. and Colombian governments is stockpiled in warehouses. Guaido was due to hold a news conference with the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay in Cucuta on Saturday morning before escorting the aid toward the border on foot. A line of heavy trucks packed with aid supplies waited to attempt the crossing, in front of rows of television cameras. CONCERNS ABOUT VIOLENCE U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton canceled plans to travel to South Korea to prepare for a summit addressing North Korea's nuclear program in order to focus instead on events unfolding in Venezuela, his spokesman said on Friday. ""To Maduro's military cronies attacking civilians at the Brazilian border - the world is watching and the perpetrators will face justice,"" Bolton wrote on Twitter. ""The Venezuelan military should protect civilians, not shoot them. Guaido, 35, head of the opposition-run Congress, has provided few details on the transport plan. Trucks are expected to be driven by Venezuelan volunteers and some opposition figures have suggested forming human chains. Maduro blames the country's dire situation on U.S. sanctions that have blocked the country from obtaining financing and have hobbled the OPEC nation's oil industry. Concerns about the potential for violence flared on Friday when the Venezuelan army opened fire in an village near the Brazilian border after indigenous leaders attempted to prevent them from advancing, killing a woman and her husband. The U.S. government condemned the killings. The U.S. envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, who traveled to Cucuta on Friday, called them ""a crime and a disgrace"", while the U.S. State Department said ""egregious violation of human rights by Maduro and those who are following his orders will not go unpunished."" Venezuelan troops on Saturday morning had blocked the Brazilian border despite protests by villagers in the nearby town of Santa Elena de Uairen who burned a bus, a truck and a National Guard office overnight. ""The situation is critical and we should be all united to allow the aid to pass,"" said shopkeeper Jeremy Ortega, 21. Brazil sent two small trucks with food and medicine to the border on Saturday, after the border closure foiled its plan to have more Venezuelans drive vehicles to pick up the 200 tonnes of aid it has stockpiled in the northern city of Boa Vista. Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo urged Venezuela's military to let the trucks in. Nearly 200,000 people attended a benefit concert in Cucuta on Friday featuring Latin pop stars, including Luis Fonsi of ""Despacito"" fame, many of whom called on Maduro to step down. A rival concert held by the ruling Socialist Party on the Venezuelan side was sparsely attended.

"""Can Protest At PM House To Demand Statehood For Delhi"": Arvind Kejriwal","""Can Protest At PM House To Demand Statehood For Delhi"": Arvind Kejriwal",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/can-protest-at-pm-modis-house-to-demand-statehood-for-delhi-arvind-kejriwal-1996730,en,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that he was not above entering the premises of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's residence to stage a sit-in protest to demand full statehood for the national capital. ""The coming (Lok Sabha) election promises to be very interesting. Delhi's seven seats can either form a government or spoil the chances of government formation. If we get these seats, we will ensure that Delhi gets full statehood,"" Mr Kejriwal said at an event organised by the Bar Council of Delhi at the Tis Hazari Courts. Recalling his nine-day sit-in protest at the Delhi Lieutenant Governor's residence in June last year, Mr Kejriwal said: ""This time, if need be, we will enter the Prime Minister's house to stage a dharna to push for our statehood demand."" Hitting out at the BJP on Wednesday, Mr Kejriwal alleged that ""a party with only three legislators"" in the 70-member assembly had been given the authority to run the national capital. The Chief Minister said that in the absence of full statehood, the government was facing hurdles in ensuring optimum governance for the people of Delhi. ""Why don't we get full statehood? Are we not patriotic enough, or do we not pay taxes?"" Mr Kejriwal asked at the function held to mark the allocation of Rs 50 crore to lawyers under the 'Social Security Scheme'. He said while his predecessor - Sheila Dikshit - had powers to transfer and post officials, they were taken away once he came to the helm. ""The real power is with those who got three seats out of 70. How will we run the government if this is how things are? I can't even transfer a peon,"" he claimed. Yesterday, Mr Kejriwal had reacted to PM Modi's greetings to Arunachal Pradesh on its statehood day with a tweet on his government's behalf. ""Sir, Delhi is also waiting for its statehood day. U had promised to the people of Delhi that you wud grant full statehood to Delhi. Kindly do it sir. People of Delhi have faced injustice for 70 years now (sic),"" he tweeted. A statement from the Bar Council said that the government has promised a grant of Rs 50 crore to lawyers, which would be enhanced as and when needed. ""This demand for social security has been going on for many years. In case of the sudden demise of a lawyer, his family is forced to lead a hand-to-mouth existence. There is no system in place for medical help,"" it said. ""We need schemes like insurance, medical aid, health cover, payment of lump sum amount in case of sudden demise, pension, schemes for young lawyers including stipend, housing and adequate infrastructural facilities in various courts,"" the statement added.

The Kisan Long March-2 -- expected to take over nine days to complete -- is being organised by the CPI(M)'s All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS). Farmers from 23 districts across Maharashtra have joined the march, flagged off from Nashik on Wednesday to mark the fourth death anniversary of Communist ideologue Govind Pansare . It will end at Mumbai on February 27, a day when the country celebrates the 88th death anniversary of freedom fighter Chandrashekhar Azad. AIKS has accused the Devendra Fadnavis government of not fulfilling the promises it made to farmers after their last movement in March 2018 . The farmers are demanding immediate relief in view of the drought-like situation; issues of irrigation; land rights; minimum support price; and a crop insurance scheme. ""A year has passed, but the state government is yet to fulfil its promises. Hence, the long march is being taken out to protest the betrayal of farmers by the BJP-led state and central governments,"" AIKS member Ajit Navale said. Meanwhile, organisers of the Kisan Long March-2 accused the government of trying to ""crush"" the peaceful march through force. ""For several hours, police kept detaining groups of farmers coming to join the procession without assigning any reason. Cases are being lodged against our office-bearers,"" AIKS spokesperson PS Prasad told IANS. Police, however, denied the allegation. ""We are just taking their names and addresses for formality's sake,"" said Thane Additional Superintendent of Police Sanjay Patil. Around 35,000 farmers had undertaken a gruelling march from Nashik to Mumbai last March, and it was called off only after the Maharashtra government ""accepted"" a majority of their demands. They now claim that none of those promises were eventually fulfilled.

The women prepared a ritualistic offering for Attukal Devi in front of the Secretariat in Thiruvanathapuram where they have been protesting for nearly a month against their abrupt termination. Speaking to news agency ANI, Sandhya, a woman employee who was terminated said the women have been protesting for 31 days, yet no relief has been granted by the state government. ""We were working on a meagre salary of Rs 480 per day, yet we did not complain. Two months ago, around 3,861 employees were terminated without any prior notice or reason,' she said. ""Only we know how we are making ends meet. We have been protesting here for 31 days now, yet our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Today, we are participating in this festival, pleading to the almighty for our pleas to be heard by the government,"" she added. Attukal Pongala is a 10-day festival celebrated at the Attukal Temple during which there is a huge gathering of millions of women on the ninth day. Women prepare divine food made of rice, jaggery and banana in earthen pots and offer it to the Goddess of the Temple - Attukal Devi. Attukal temple is also popularly kown as women's Sabarimala - where only women are allowed to take part in the rituals.

"3 UK Lawmakers Quit Party In Protest Over ""Disastrous Brexit""","3 UK Lawmakers Quit Party In Protest Over ""Disastrous Brexit""",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/three-uk-conservatives-quit-party-in-protest-over-disastrous-brexit-1996625,en,"Three pro-EU lawmakers from Britain's governing Conservatives quit over the ""disastrous handling of Brexit"" on Wednesday, in a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May's attempts to unite her party around plans to leave the European Union. The lawmakers, long critical of May's Brexit strategy to leave the EU which they believe is being driven by Conservative eurosceptics, said in a statement they would join a new group in parliament set up by seven former opposition Labour politicians. The resignations put May in an even weaker position in parliament, where her Brexit deal was crushed by lawmakers last month when eurosceptics and EU supporters voted against an agreement that both sides say offers the worst of all worlds. They could also undermine May's negotiating position in Brussels, where she is going later on Wednesday for talks with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to try to secure an opening for further technical work on revising the agreement. With only 37 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit are redrawing the political landscape. The resignations threaten a decades-old two-party system. ""The final straw for us has been this government's disastrous handling of Brexit,"" the three lawmakers, Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston, said in a statement. ""We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP,"" they said, referring to a group of Conservative pro-Brexit lawmakers and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which props up the government in parliament. Earlier this week, seven former Labour lawmakers announced a new movement, the Independent Group, after quitting their party over increasing frustration with their leader Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit strategy and a row over anti-Semitism. Another former Labour lawmaker joined their ranks late on Tuesday, and several politicians from both the main opposition party and Conservatives said they expected more to follow from both sides of parliament. For May's Brexit plan, the resignations are yet another blow to more than two years of talks to leave the EU, which have been punctuated by defeats in parliament, rows over policy and a confidence vote, which she ultimately won.

They were arrested outside the Uttaranchal College of Science and Technology on Sahastradhara Road on Monday after they shouted slogans demanding expulsion of Kashmiri students, Dehradun's Senior Superintendent of Police or SSP Nivedita Kukreti said. The protesters were later released on bail. There have been a series of protests against Kashmiri students in Dehradun after the Pulwama terror attack, with even the authorities in Jammu and Kashmir expressing concerns over their safety. The managements of two city colleges even announced they will not admit Kashmiri students in the future following the protests. However, Anil Saini, Chairman of Alpine College of Management and Technology, one of the two colleges, told news agency Press Trust of India that they were forced to make the announcement under pressure, but have taken no such decisions. Baba Farid Institute of Technology, which was the other city-based institution to give a similar commitment in writing, also admitted that it did so under severe pressure from a mob. Authorities in Dehradun have assured full safety and security of the students from Jammu and Kashmir. The Inspector-General of Police or IG of Garhwal range, Ajay Rautela, said that the Kashmiri students are completely safe and they should not worry. Police patrolling in Premnagar area, where most of the Kashmiri students live, has been stepped up. He also appealed to people to maintain calm. The police said they have also taken action in a few cases. A Kashmiri student of Sridev Suman Subharti University was arrested for sending a WhatsApp message to his friends exulting over the terrorist attack on CRPF soldiers. A case was also registered against activist from JNU, Shehla Rashid, after she claimed on Twitter that some girl students were ""trapped"" by a mob shouting slogans outside their hostel in the city. Police confirmed that there has not been a single incident on Tuesday with no complaints or distress calls received from anywhere. The Jammu and Kashmir government has also set up a helpline for students with designated officers appointed to take care of those in the city. ""There have been numerous calls from students of different colleges including Baba Farid Institute of Tech, Alpine Institute, Dolphin Institute, SBS Medical College and so on so forth,"" a Jammu and Kashmir government spokesman said on Monday. Some of the students from Dehradun have reached Delhi and have been accommodated at J&K House in Chanakyapuri, he said. He also said that around 100 students from Sailakui have gathered in Rampur.

The services department comes under Lt Governor Anil Baijal in the national capital. The Budget Session of the Delhi Assembly is beginning today. Mr Sisodia wrote to Chief Secretary Vijay Kumar Dev and asked him to implement the Sahai Committee's recommendations or Cabinet decisions. Earlier in the day, Mr Sisodia met protesting employees of his government who are demanding restructuring of the DASS and steno cadre. Three members of the Delhi Government Employees Welfare Association (DGEWA) have been sitting on a hunger-strike outside the Delhi Secretariat for the last four days in favour of their demands. ""It seems services department is completely insensitive to the plight of employees of government of Delhi and deliberately trying to hamper the functioning of the government by compelling the employees at such a crucial time when the budget session is in the offing and also the financial year closing,"" Mr Sisodia said in the letter. Umesh Batra, the general secretary of the DGEWA, said there are around 12,000 employees pertaining to DASS, steno and clerk cadre. According to a government statement, Mr Sisodia expressed solidarity with the protesting employees. Addressing hundreds of protestors, the deputy chief minister rued that services do not come under the AAP government, adding that he was ""pained"" to see the DASS cadre continuously subjected to ""injustice"". ""Since May 2015, we are fighting to retain the services with the Delhi government. This is not a personal fight, but a fight against the repressive system,"" a government statement quoted Mr Sisodia as saying. He appealed to the employees to call off their hunger strike as it affects the health of those sitting on the protest, the statement stated. Mr Sisodia also conveyed the assurance from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal that the elected government is committed towards the interests of employees working for the Delhi government.

The temporary truce followed a five-hour meeting on the sixth day of the chief minister's protest outside the Raj Niwas demanding the governor's recall. He accuses Kiran Bedi of acting as a ""BJP agent"" and blocking his government's welfare schemes. Mr Narayanasamy claimed that Kiran Bedi had agreed to his demands including delegating financial powers to him and his ministers. ""Most of the important issues, including payment of monthly assistance to 10,000 new applicants under old age and widow pension, and auctioning of the cooperative sugar mill to raise funds to pay farmers and workers were discussed, and the Lt Governor accorded her approval to these schemes,"" the chief minister said. After the talks, the chief minister said he and his cabinet colleagues met and decided ""unanimously"" that ""the agitations including jail bharo and a fast on Wednesday and Thursday are suspended"". The breakthrough came on a day Kiran Bedi's fellow anti-corruption campaigner-turned-critic Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, arrived to meet his Puducherry counterpart and express solidarity with him. Thanking Mr Kejriwal, Mr Narayanasamy said: ""He supported the cause of democracy and it's significant"". Mr Kejriwal had said: ""Instead of fighting for petty things, we would fight together for statehood for Delhi and Puducherry."" While showing support for the Congress leader, Mr Kejriwal was non-committal on the question of a tie-up with the party for the national election. ""I am here not as an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader but as the Delhi chief minister meeting the Puducherry chief minister,"" he said. Kiran Bedi tweeted ""The meet helped clarify and consolidate issues. I am happy Puducherry government will return to work."" The Congress government in Puducherry has been in almost constant conflict with Kiran Bedi, a former Indian Police Service officer who is known to give instructions to the police, review government projects and even cracked down on irregularities in private medical admission. The latest flashpoint came when she implemented a mandatory helmet rule,  which Mr Narayanasamy wanted done in phases. The tug-of-war has certainly affected governance in Puducherry.

Two people were killed in police firing in Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura areas in Faridkot district in October 2015. The Special Investigation Team, set up to probe the incidents, last month arrested former Moga district SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma, the first person held after the SIT was formed last year. He was leading a police team that allegedly opened fire at protesters in Behbal Kalan. ""I can confirm that Paramraj Singh Umranangal has been arrested from Chandigarh on the basis of sufficient evidence we have against him,"" SIT member Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh said. ""We have questioned a number of people, including police officials, as part of our investigation. He was questioned twice. We have got sufficient evidence that...the procedure adopted (to open fire) was not correct,"" Mr Singh said. ""It was proved that protesters were sitting peacefully and there was no provocation by them. It was also proved that firing was opened deliberately,"" he said. The SIT member said Mr Umranangal was posted as Ludhiana Police Commissioner when the incident happened. ""During investigation, it came to light that he was commanding everything and force in strength had gone there (the spot where protesters were sitting) from Ludhiana. He was managing everything,"" said the official. Asked who ordered the firing, Mr Singh replied, ""As the investigation will progress, more things will come to light. For now, it is sufficient to say we have enough evidence, sufficient base for arresting him"". Mr Umranangal will be produced before a court in Faridkot on Tuesday, he said. Replying to another question, the official said the SIT will question more people if required. ""It is a transparent investigation, and things are being made available in public domain."" Mr Umranangal was previously questioned by the SIT last November. Punjab government last year added the names of a few police officials, including former SSP Sharma, in an FIR registered in connection with the firing incident at Behbal Kalan.

Maharashtra To Move Planned Saudi Aramco Refinery After Farmers Protest,Maharashtra To Move Planned Saudi Aramco Refinery After Farmers Protest,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maharashtra-to-move-planned-saudi-aramco-refinery-after-farmers-protest-1995509,en,"Opposition from farmers has prompted Maharashtra to move the location for what would be the country's biggest oil refinery, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said. Stare-run oil companies and Saudi Aramco have teamed up to build the $44 billion refinery , which is aimed at giving India steady fuel supplies while meeting Saudi Arabia's need to secure regular buyers for its oil. But thousands of farmers are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood. After their protests, land acquisition has been stopped for the refinery at the proposed site at Nanar , a village in Ratnagiri district, some 400 km south of Mumbai, Mr Fadnavis said on Monday. The refinery will be built at a place where local population won't oppose the project, he said in a press conference, without identifying a new location. Mr Fadnavis made the announcement after the BJP forged an alliance with Shiv Sena for the upcoming general election. The location of refinery was one of the contentious issues between the parties, with Shiv Sena opposing the refinery. The announcement comes as Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to arrive in India on Tuesday and is expected to announce investments in energy and infrastructure during the visit. The Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), which is running the project, says the 1.2 million barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing. RRPCL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, has said suggestions the refinery would damage the environment were baseless. ""The company is hopeful that the state government will provide sufficient land for the project on the western coast,"" Anil Nagwekar, a spokesman for the RRPCL, told Reuters.

The last warning letter she received from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation, which comes under the Catholic Church, was on February 2. ""Of course I am being targeted because I supported the nuns protesting against Bishop Franco Mullackal, after their colleague - a nun - raised allegations of sexual abuse against him. I have been a nun with them for 33 years, and all their complaints are based for just one year,"" Sister Lucy told NDTV with a confident smile. ""I am not judging them (church authorities) still. But they have to open their eyes to the cases of sexual abuses happening to children, women and nuns too... I want to meet Pope Francis and talk to him about sexual abuse within our churches. Priests must be allowed to marry. Priesthood and marriage should go hand in hand,"" Sister Lucy says with a spirited zeal. ""I did not know these protesting nuns before. I have never seen them before. Only when they started protesting in Kochi, I got to know about them from the media. I haven't heard or seen Bishop Franco before that. But I am a nun and how could I not support the nuns fighting for their justice. I am one of them. These nuns have been isolated from the church. It is a horrible situation. My attitude is to always be with the oppressed, unwanted,"" an unwavering Sister Lucy said. Sister Lucy teaches higher secondary students at a government-aided school near her convent in Wayanad. ""My students are very fond of me. They come and encourage me saying 'this is our sister', 'you must fight for the truth'"", Sister Lucy said, almost laughing. The church has accused the nun of violating canonical orders, her superiors, dress code, and even questioned her intentions behind getting a driving licence, buying a car and speaking out in public debates since September 28, 2018. It was the time when five nuns from Kottayam had taken to the streets in their official robes, protesting against rape-accused Franco Mullackal. ""My mind says that it is impossible for them to get me out of the convent. There is court, law. There is India to stand by me. There are Indian leaders. We should follow rules of India first. But if I have to face the situation of being expelled, I will still be happy. Because then I will be sister of the whole world,"" Sister Lucy said.

The meeting, Mr Kejriwal underscored, was not a political one, it was rather to discuss the ""fight for complete statehood"" that Delhi and Puducherry must have. ""It is extremely important to express solidarity Narayansamy. Kiran Bedi is not allowing an elected government to run. She is trampling on the Constitution and democracy,"" Mr Kejriwal told NDTV. Mr Narayansamy was on a sit-down protest outside the Raj Bhavan for the last six days, waiting for Kiran Bedi's approval for his government's proposals on welfare schemes and administrative matters. Ms Bedi has termed his protest ""illegal"". Late on Monday night, Mr Narayansamy temporarily ended his protest after Ms Bedi agreed to his demands of delegating financial powers to the Chief Minister from April 1, as advised by the centre. Ms Bedi tweeted: The Dharna by HCM outside RajNivas is over. The HCM, Council Of Ministers, CS and Secretaries,met. It helped clarify and consolidate issues. Am happy Puducherry Government will return to work tom morning. So will the road to RajNivas be open for visitors to come to RajNivas. Mr Narayansamy thanked Mr Kejriwal and DMK's MK Stalin for showing solidarity. ""This is not democracy. Chief Ministers sitting on dharna has become the norm. Lieutenant Governors in Puducherry and Delhi have been appointed with a mandate to not let these governments run,"" said Mr Kejriwal, who was on a nine-day dharna last year at the waiting room at Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal in Delhi. Recently, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also held a three-day sit-in protest against the Central government in Kolkata. Mr Kejriwal said full statehood should be granted to Puducherry and Delhi, union territories where the powers of the elected Chief Ministers are curtailed by Lieutenant Governors appointed by the central government. Mr Kejriwal contends that through them, the centre tends to rule by proxy. Contending the system can defy the will of the people, he said, ""Narayansamy is accountable to the people, Kiran Bedi is accountable to none... Kiran Bedi, who was defeated by the people, is ruling the people and Narayansamy, who was elected, sits on dharna"". The reference was to the BJP's defeat in Delhi, when they fielded the former top cop as the party's candidate for Chief Minister's post. In the same assembly elections of 2015, Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party had swept to power, winning 67 of Delhi's 70 assembly seats.

The clarification that has also been put outside an outlet in South Delhi comes a day after another outlet in Bengaluru's Indiranagar was forced to cover the ""Karachi"" part of its signboard outside the shop amid calls for change of the name of the bakery. The staff at the Delhi outlet told NDTV they have been asked by the police to remain careful. ""The brand was established in 1953 and is an Indian company based out of Hyderabad, Telangana. The popularity and love of its products has contributed to its growth in India and abroad,"" the post on the Facebook page, followed by over 118,000 people, reads. The statement has also been shared on its Twitter account. The bakery chain, set up by Khanchand Ramnani in 1953, has its outlets in Mumbai apart from Delhi and Bengaluru. Reports said a crowd, angry over the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama last week, in which more than 40 CRPF soldiers were killed, protested outside the Bengaluru outlet of the bakery chain on Friday. Among the many people who condemned the protest is film producer and director Onir, who tweeted: ""We are behaving like Fools when demanding the name Karachi to be removed. Bombay/ Delhi/ Calcutta restaurants are there all over Pakistan. (sic)"" Amid the outpouring of social media reactions, a Twitter user, surprised over the incident, said, ""I thought we were game changers and not name changers.""  Trying to change the name of Karachi Bakery? And I thought we were game changers and not name changers. People in Banglore are protesting against Karachi bakery . Absolute clownish and pathetic . #Banglrprotests Karachi bakery is of Hyderabad origins. No such thing over here. Many parts across the country have witnessed protests and violence after the attack on CRPF convoy in South Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14. Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed the responsibility for the attack. PM Narendra Modi, however, today warned against the targeting of Kashmiris in response to the violence. ""Our fight is for Kashmir, not against Kashmiris... Kashmiris have suffered the most due to terrorism, and the rest of the country must stand in their support,"" he said at a rally in Rajasthan's Tonk.

Teen In Lincoln Memorial Protest Sues Washington Post For $250 Million,Teen In Lincoln Memorial Protest Sues Washington Post For $250 Million,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/teen-nicholas-sandmann-in-lincoln-memorial-protest-sues-washington-post-for-250-million-1996185,en,"A high school student from Covington, Kentucky, sued the Washington Post for defamation on Tuesday, claiming the newspaper falsely accused him of racist acts and instigating a confrontation with a Native American activist in a January videotaped incident at the Lincoln Memorial. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Kentucky by Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann, 16, seeks $250 million in damages, the amount that Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com and the world's richest person, paid for the Post in 2013. The lawsuit claims that the newspaper ""wrongfully targeted and bullied"" the teen to advance its bias against President Donald Trump because Sandmann is a white Catholic who wore a Make America Great Again souvenir cap on a school field trip to the March for Life anti-abortion rally in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 18. The Washington Post's Vice President for Communications Kristine Coratti Kelly said: ""We are reviewing a copy of the lawsuit and we plan to mount a vigorous defence."" In a photo that went viral from the incident, Sandmann is seen standing face to face with Native American activist Nathan Phillips. Sandmann stares smiling at him while Phillips sings and plays his drum. The incident sparked outrage on social media. First Of Many In a statement, Sandmann's Atlanta-based lawyer, Lin Wood, said additional similar lawsuits would be filed in the weeks ahead. A private investigation firm retained by Covington Diocese in Park Hills, Kentucky, found in a report released last week no evidence the teenagers provoked a confrontation. The students were met at the Lincoln Memorial by offensive statements from members of the Black Hebrew Israelites, the report said. The investigation also determined that the students did not direct any racist or offensive comments toward Phillips although several performed a ""tomahawk chop"" to the beat of his drum. Phillips claimed in a separate video that he heard the students chanting ""build that wall,"" during the encounter, a reference to Trump's pledge to build a barrier along the U.S. border with Mexico. The investigators said they found no evidence of such a chant and that Phillips did not respond to multiple attempts to contact him.

Protests After Satirical Bengali Film Pulled Out Of Theatres Post Release,Protests After Satirical Bengali Film Pulled Out Of Theatres Post Release,https://www.ndtv.com/kolkata-news/bhobishyoter-bhoot-protests-after-satirical-bengali-film-pulled-out-of-theatres-post-release-1995069,en,"Film buffs and youth activists on Sunday joined a sit-in protest against the withdrawal of director Anik Dutta's film "" Bhobishyoter Bhoot "" (Ghost of the Future) from almost all multiplexes and single screen theatres in West Bengal. Thespian actor Soumitra Chatterjee shot off a letter, calling the taking off of the film 'vindictive' and 'undemocratic', and a ""fascist policy"". The film, a social and political satire that released to packed houses on Friday, was apparently taken off by the hall owners following ""instructions from higher authorities,"" Mr Dutta said. ""Still, I haven't got any official communication' regarding the cancellation, all they (hall owners) said was that the instructions were from higher authorities. But I have received immense support and the film fraternity has shown great solidarity,"" said the director of the 2012 block buster Bhooter Bhobishyot . The sit-in was organised by fans and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) activists outside Star Theatre, one of the oldest commercial Bengali theatre. Mr Dutta read out the letter sent by the veteran actor during the protest. Expressing shock, Mr Chatterjee said it was a 'vindictive act' of the administration. He referred to the comment made by the director during the 24th Kolkata International Film Festival last November. Mr Dutta had then criticised the 'excessive' use of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's posters in and around the film fest venues and argued that the film personalities should get more limelight during such events. Mr Chatterjee wondered if there will be 'any platform in the country where people can express themselves freely' and whether film makers will be able to include any content with which the authorities do not agree. ""I strongly condemn such fascist policy even if they stay undercover,"" he wrote. In his letter, Mr Chatterjee hoped that all those responsible for taking off the film from the cinemas 'will realise that it is an undemocratic act' and 'protest against it'. A release from the film's production company said prior to its release, the State Intelligence Unit wrote to the producer Kalyanmoy Chatterjee seeking a private screening 'on a priority basis'. They asked for the screening in the light of information received that it may 'hurt public sentiments which may lead to political law and order issues'. The producer had immediately replied that the film has been passed by the CBFC and asking for private screening was beyond the jurisdiction and legal competence of the police. The team of "" Bhobishyoter Bhoot "" got no further response till the film released.

The court was hearing the Vedanta group's request for a direction to Tamil Nadu's pollution control body to implement an order by the National Green Tribunal which allowed the copper plant to reopen, in a case that is seen as politically sensitive. The Tamil Nadu government had approached the top court against the green court's order. The Supreme Court today said the green court has no jurisdiction to entertain the case. Sterlite, the company owned by the Vedanta Group, can approach the Madras High Court with its request for permission to reopen the copper plant in Thoothukudi district, the top court said. A bench headed by Justice RF Nariman said it is allowing Tamil Nadu's appeal against the green court order only on grounds of maintainability. 13 people were killed in violent protests over the Sterlite plant in Tamil Nadu's Thoothukudi. (File) The copper plant of Sterlite was ordered to be shut by the Tamil Nadu government in May last year over alleged pollution that led to violent protests in May last year, culminating in police opening fire on demonstrators and killing 13. The Tamil Nadu government had ordered the state pollution control board to seal and ""permanently"" close the plant. State authorities had snapped electric supply to the Sterlite plant last May, after protests by local residents. Environmentalists and local activists claim that the copper smelting unit was polluting the groundwater in the area, making many come down with serious diseases.

In the wake of the terror attack on a CRPF convoy that killed over 40 soldiers, 24 film associations, including Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) and Indian Film and Television Directors' Association (IFTDA), staged a protest at Filmcity in Goregaon. Virendra Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Suresh Raina and VVS Laxman, among others, were shooting for a commercial in Filmcity when they joined the protest to show their solidarity. ""Whatever we say or do will perhaps be less for the soldiers and their daily. We can only thank them and should do whatever can to help them. We are pained but are hopeful for a better time for all of us in the future,"" Sehwag said. Harbhajan said he hopes the sacrifice of the soldiers does not go in vain. ""These are tough times but let's stay united so that they aren't able to break us. I'm grateful to all the soldiers who protect us around the clock. Cricketers, actors aren't heroes. The real hero of the nation is our soldier,"" Harbhajan said. The protest saw participation from major film bodies and the association of cinematographers, make up men, costumes, junior artists, editors, fighters and dancers. Casting director-filmmaker Mukesh Chabra, actor Nia Sharma, Isha Kopikar and others were also present at the protest to show their solidarity. According to sources, Amitabh Bachchan was shooting for Brahmastra at the venue. BN Tiwari, president of Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE), told PTI that all the film bodies have decided to ""completely boycott"" any Pakistani artiste working in Hindi films. ""We won't let any film release which has even a song by any Pakistani singer, forget about actors. We will take strong action if we come to know anything."" President of IFTDA, Ashoke Pandit, echoed a similar sentiment and said the film bodies have decided to boycott Navjot Singh Siddhu. Sidhu, who appears on The Kapil Sharma Show, had condemned the incident but courted a controversy when he asked whether an entire nation can be blamed for a handful of people. Over 40 CRPF soldiers were killed when a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle laden with explosives into their bus on Thursday.

In Rouen in the north, four people were injured after a driver tried to force his way through a crowd of protesters, authorities said. Demonstrators gathered peacefully earlier in the day at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, a flashpoint of clashes with the police in the early days of the protests, before marching towards the Eiffel Tower. Later in the afternoon, police and hooded protesters clashed at the Esplanade des Invalides in central Paris where the march was expected to end, forcing some into adjoining streets where some skirmishes were reported. In Bordeaux and Lyon, police also fired tear gas and charged, to disperse projectile-throwing demonstrators after bins were set on fire and properties destroyed. Protesters tried to block a depot operated by online retail giant Amazon and some threw stones at police in Toulouse in the south, BFM Television reported. A poll this week showed dwindling support for the ""yellow vests"" demonstrations, named for motorists' high-visibility jackets, which began in November over fuel taxes and morphed into a more general revolt against politicians and a government they see as out of touch. More than half of those surveyed said they wanted the occasionally violent protests to end. But some at Saturday's protests said they were part of a humanist movement aimed at improving the lives of everyone in the country. ""I can understand that some people have had enough, but we're not doing this just for us,"" said Madeleine, a 33-year old unemployed protester. ""It's a very humanist movement and we're doing this for everyone. So if right now they're fed up, then too bad for them."" There has been infighting between leaders of the grassroots movement, although some have outlined plans to extend the weekly protests to Sunday. The number of protesters have fallen from highs of over 300,000 nationwide in November to over 51,000 last week, according to government estimates. French interior ministry said around 41,500 protesters took part in demonstrations across the country, compared with 51,400 including 4,000 in the capital, compared with 5,000 in Paris last week.

Although the Ashok Gehlot cabinet had passed a bill in this regard on Wednesday, community leaders said they would call off the agitation only after receiving more clarity on the matter. Today's assurance, however, seems to have finally convinced them. According to reports reaching here, agitators have already vacated the Sawai Madhopur railway track - allowing train services between Delhi and Mumbai to resume. Protesters led by Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla had also blocked the Jaipur-Bharatpur national highway, which is crucial for tourists travelling the golden triangle of Delhi, Agra and the Rajasthan capital. Now that the strike has been called off, bus services on the Jaipur-Kota, Jaipur-Agra and Jaipur-Bharatpur routes are expected to be restored by evening. The state government had unanimously passed the Rajasthan Backward Classes (Amendment) Bill-2019 on Wednesday. The legislation provided Gujjars with 5% reservation in a special category because the government held that circumstances have changed ever since the centre gave 10% reservation to economically weaker sections recently and brought about a constitutional amendment for the same. The bill sought to increase the backward classes' reservation from 21% to 26% with 5% quota for the Gujjar, Banjara, Gadia Lohar, Raika and Gadaria communities. It said that the need for such a provision was justified because these five communities were the ""most backward"" in the state. Soon after the agitation was called off, the Railways issued a notification stating that seven cancelled train services between Rajasthan and southern cities will resume with immediate effect. The Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani, which has been facing delays of nearly 10 hours due to diversions, will also start running on its usual route shortly.

Franciscan Clarist Congregation Superior General has issued this second warning letter to the nun. The letter states ''..invite you to change your mind and attitude sincerely...If you don''t respond positively I will be constrained to proceed with your dismissal from Congregation."" In January this year, she was served a warning letter by the Superior General of the Congregation. The letter to the nun of Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC), who has been an outspoken supporter of the nun's protest at Ernakulam to demand the arrest of Bishop Mulakkal, said this was the first warning with the threat of dismissal from the congregation. A previous letter to Sister Kalappura, on January 1, alleged that the nun had been leading a life against the principles of religious life and against the Rule and Constitution of the Franciscan Clarist Congregation. Bishop Mulakkal, a senior member of the Roman Catholic clergy in India, was arrested last year following allegations by a nun that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted her at the Kuravilangad convent between 2014 and 2016, a charge denied by him.

New Delhi had, this morning, summoned Pakistan Envoy Sohail Mahmood and told him that Pakistan must take ""immediate and verifiable action"" against the Jaish-e-Mohammed and that it must immediately stop and groups or individuals associated with terrorism operating from its territories. A short video clip has surfaced showing the Indian envoy leaving Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile, New Delhi has also called back the Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan, Ajay Bisaria, for consultations. India has already decided to remove ""Most Favoured Nation"" privileges given to Pakistan, and said it will work to ensure the country's isolation globally. Most Favoured Nation status is given to a trade partner to ensure non-discriminatory trade between two nations. On Thursday afternoon, a suicide bomber detonated a car-load of explosives next to a large convoy of 78 CRPF buses with over 2,500 personnel travelling on the highway from Jammu to Srinagar. At Pulwama, the car with 60 kg of explosives blew up, killing over 40 personnel reporting to duty after leave. The attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed immediately. India had last evening appealed to all members of the international community to ""support the proposal to list terrorists, including JeM chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council and to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan"", a clear reference to China which has been blocking all efforts to listing Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN Security Council. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the attack a matter of ""grave concern"". But in a brief statement, it added, ""We strongly reject any insinuation by elements in the Indian government and media circles that seek to link the attack to the State of Pakistan without investigations.""

"India Summons Pakistan Envoy, Strongly Protests Pulwama Terror Attack","India Summons Pakistan Envoy, Strongly Protests Pulwama Terror Attack",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-summons-pakistan-envoy-strongly-protests-pulwama-terror-attack-that-killed-40-soldiers-1994111,en,"A day after the Pulwama terror attack in which over 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers were killed, India on Friday summoned Pakistan's envoy and lodged a strong protest. Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale summoned Pakistan's High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood and sources say a very strong demarche or diplomatic protest was lodged. Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed has claimed the attack. Government sources say India conveyed that Pakistan must take immediate and verifiable action against the Jaish-e-Mohammad and that it must immediately stop any groups or individuals associated with terrorism operating from its territories. The Foreign Secretary and other secretaries have also started meeting envoys of the P5 countries, the Gulf, Japan and European nations to apprise them of Pakistan's role in sponsoring terror. The P5 is a reference to the five permanent countries at the United Nations Security Council which also included China. Pulwama terror attack: Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed has claimed the attack. India's envoy to Islamabad has been asked to come to Delhi for consultations on the next steps. Sources told NDTV that scaling down the strength of the High Commissions or even expelling the Pakistan High Commissioner is on the table. On Thursday night, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement, saying, ""this heinous and despicable act  has been perpetrated by  Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based and supported terrorist organisation proscribed by the United Nations and other countries.  This terror group is led by the international terrorist Masood Azhar, who has been given full freedom by Government of Pakistan to operate and expand his terror infrastructure in territories under the control of Pakistan and to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere with impunity."" India also appealed to all members of the international community to back the naming of Masood Azhar as a ""UN designated terrorist"" and ""to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan"", a clear reference to China which has been blocking all efforts to ban Azhar at the United Nations. The US has also asked Pakistan to ""immediately end support and safe haven to all terrorist groups"". India on Friday also decided to remove ""Most Favoured Nation"" privileges given to Pakistan and said it would take all steps to ensure the country's isolation globally. ""The most favoured nation status to Pakistan stands revoked,"" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, briefing the media on the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 7 Lok Kalyan Mark home in Delhi.

Amazon Drops New York Headquarters Plan Amid Protests,Amazon Drops New York Headquarters Plan Amid Protests,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/amazon-drops-new-york-headquarters-plan-amid-protests-1993871,en,"Amazon on Thursday abandoned plans for a new headquarters site in New York City, citing opposition from local leaders angry at the huge subsidies being offered to one of the world's most successful companies. The New York neighborhood of Long Island City had been one of two locations Amazon selected last year after a long search for a second headquarters or ""HQ2."" The online giant had promised the sprawling complex in the borough of Queens would create 25,000 new jobs in exchange for nearly $3 billion in state and city incentives -- which had riled some in the community. ""While polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project,"" Amazon said in a statement. ""We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion -- we love New York, its incomparable dynamism, people, and culture -- and particularly the community of Long Island City, where we have gotten to know so many optimistic, forward-leaning community leaders, small business owners, and residents."" Amazon said it would ""continue growing"" its workforce in New York which includes some 5,000 people. No New Bidding The company said it would not reopen the bidding process but would ""proceed as planned"" with a headquarters site in Northern Virginia and a logistics center in Nashville, Tennessee. It added that it ""will continue to hire and grow across our 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the US and Canada."" New York neighborhood of Long Island City had been one of two locations Amazon selected last year. The New York plan had been endorsed by Mayor Bill De Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo, but ran into fierce opposition from some local politicians and community activists, including newly elected Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the New York site. After the announcement, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: ""today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world."" De Blasio sounded bitter about the loss of Amazon, which reversed the deal clinched after months of negotiations. ""We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world. Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity,"" the mayor said in a statement. ""We have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone. If Amazon can't recognize what that's worth, its competitors will."" Both conservatives and liberal opponents of the deal have argued that Amazon does not need what some describe as ""corporate welfare"" for the company led by Jeff Bezos, the world's wealthiest person. In addition to complaints about the scale of the incentives, critics voiced concerns that the promised jobs could inflate an already overpriced housing market and strain infrastructure. Initial reactions to Amazon's decision from the local community appeared mixed. ""I'm relieved because I'm a renter here,"" said one female resident of the Queens neighborhood who declined to give her name. ""I'm not sure these jobs would have been what the people living in this community need."" Bitter Pill But others like David Katzen, who owns a construction company in the neighborhood but does not live there, were disappointed. ""It was a horrible decision by the local legislators to oppose it,"" he told AFP. ""It was short sighted and ultimately what's going to happen here? Nothing. There's no good that came of this."" Amazon, the dominant online retail giant which also operates services in cloud computing, streaming media and artificial intelligence, began seeking a new headquarters, saying it was outgrowing its current home in Seattle, Washington. Chelsea Connor of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which had protested the subsidies offered to Amazon, criticized the company for pulling out instead of renegotiating the deal. ""Rather than addressing the legitimate concerns that have been raised by many New Yorkers Amazon says you do it our way or not at all, we will not even consider the concerns of New Yorkers -- that's not what a responsible business would do,"" said Connor. Scott Galloway, a New York University professor and author, said on Twitter after the announcement: ""Immunities kick in and NYC finds its testicles. This is good for NYC, and America.

Protests Continue In Kargil Over Centre's Ladakh Division Move,Protests Continue In Kargil Over Centre's Ladakh Division Move,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/protests-continue-in-kargil-over-centres-ladakh-division-move-1993757,en,"Fresh protests erupted in Kargil district on Thursday, a day after the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) called for a mass civil disobedience movement in the region. Thousands marched through its streets in sub-zero temperatures to seek a review of the centre's decision to grant Ladakh a separate administrative divison with its headquarters at Leh. Protests have been raging across Kargil for the sixth consecutive day, and all government offices have been closed to condemn the government's decision. As district offices in Kargil and Leh function under autonomous councils, the mass movement called by LAHDC Kargil has created a serious challenge for the governor's administration. ""Establishing the headquarters of Ladakh division at Leh has hurt the sentiments of the people of Kargil,"" the civic body's resolution read. A controversial order passed by the government on February 8 sanctioned the creation of a separate administrative and revenue division comprising Leh and Kargil districts, with its headquarters at Leh. Ladakh was part of Kashmir division until now. Residents, however, have refused to be part of the newly created division unless there is six-month rotation of offices between Leh and Kargil. Terming the government order as ""absolute injustice"", LAHDC Chief Executive Councillor Feroz Ahmad Khan said the government was free to establish the headquarters at Leh as long as Kargil remains with Kashmir division. All the elected leaders from Kargil, including Mr Khan, have threatened to resign if the order is not withdrawn. Although the BJP had won the Ladakh parliamentary seat in 2014, it suffered huge reverses when several senior party leaders - including its local parliamentarian - resigned in November. The government's decision has also given rise to a butterfly effect, with demands for separate administrative divisions cropping up from Jammu's Pirpanjal and Chenab Valley. While the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party strongly back the creation of separate divisions for these regions, the BJP is vehemently opposed to it. The decision on separating Ladakh from the Kashmir division was taken less than a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Leh.

Over a dozen people have been injured in mob attacks, sources said. Two army columns have been sent to stage flag march and maintain peace, officials said. The curfew was imposed as authorities feared a communal backlash, they added. Protesters, particularly in the old city, refused to disperse even after loudspeakers announced that curfew was imposed. ""We have imposed curfew in Jammu city as a precautionary measure,"" Deputy Commissioner of Jammu Ramesh Kumar told news agency PTI. There was a complete shutdown in Jammu city, with no traffic on roads and all shops and markets closed. Several areas of Jammu were hit by massive anti-Pakistan protests with people taking to the streets, including Jewel Chowk, Purani Mundi, Rehari, Shaktinagar, Pacca Danga, Janipur, Gandhinagar and Bakshinagar. According to some reports, there were mob attacks in Gujjar Nagar area where several vehicles were damaged by stone-throwers. However, the police said they had managed to prevent a major clash. Kashmiri employees at Jammu's Tourist Reception Centre have sent SOS messages to police seeking protection after mobs burnt vehicles outside TRC and pelted stones. Raising slogans against Pakistan and terrorists, protesters burnt tyres on roads. Demonstrators put up barricades demanding that the attacks be avenged. Jammu and Kashmir leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah condemned the violence. Distressed to hear about miscreants in Jammu trying to take advantage of the situation by inciting tension. Guv adm should have preempted this by securing minority dominated areas. Have spoken to IG Jammu to deploy additional security. It will be a travesty & against the spirit of our secular ethno-cultural values to use this terror attack as an excuse to target minorities. Hour of the need is to show compassion & come together. Giving vent to anger by attacking innocent people because of their ethnicity or religion is no way to honour the sacrifices yesterday. Reports of violence & arson in #Jammu are deeply worrying. I hope political leaders & civil society are able to ensure cooler heads prevail. Kashmiris/Muslims in Jammu didn't attack our CRPF jawans yesterday, terrorists did. This violence is a convenient tool by some to shift the blame. Let's unite against terror let's not allow terror to divide us. Earlier, the Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries (JCCI) had on Thursday called for shutdown in Jammu protesting terror attack. Protesting the Pulwama attack, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association, Jammu, suspended work in all the courts in Jammu, including the high court and tribunals.

Richa Singh tweeted a picture of herself in the hospital bed with injuries today. The protests were organised against the denial of permission to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav to fly to Allahabad, which also rocked the Uttar Pradesh legislature on Wednesday as angry members of the party and ally Bahujan Samaj Party members stalled proceedings of both the Houses. The decision to ground Mr Yadav has brought his party workers on the warpath across the state. Mr Yadav was on way to the Allahabad University for a function, but was physically stopped by the police from boarding a special flight to Prayagraj, 200 km from Lucknow on Tuesday. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the government had taken action after a request from the university, which was apprehensive about a law and order situation. Mr Yadav's party called it an attempt to ""kill democracy"".

Samajwadi Party supporters on a spree of violence vandalised vehicles and clashed with the police when they came to control the mob . In Prayagraj, parliamentarian Dharmendra Yadav was injured in lathicharge by the police, the party claimed. In state capital Lucknow, protesters gathered outside the assembly complex and the Governor's House. Others rushed to the airport, the Ground Zero of the trouble. At Gorakhpur, the home turf of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, roads were blocked by a slogan shouting mob. Mr Yadav's tweets on his experience, and the photos and videos posted by his party's media cell, had also incensed the opposition parties, which took on the ruling BJP in the parliament and the state assembly. In Rajya Sabha, members of the SP and the other opposition parties held protests over the incident, disrupting the House proceedings. Photos tweeted by Mr Yadav showed police officers blocking his path to the flight. A video tweeted by his party showed the confrontation that followed. एक छात्र नेता के शपथ ग्रहण कार्यक्रम से सरकार इतनी डर रही है कि मुझे लखनऊ हवाई-अड्डे पर रोका जा रहा है! pic.twitter.com/eaNrUQX1SX In Facebook post, Mr Yadav dubbed it the ""remote control politics of two-and-a-half-men"". ""I understand the need to ensure the safety of people and property and would never do something to endanger either knowingly.

"""We Win"": Northeast Rejoices As Citizenship Amendment Bill Goes Off Rails","""We Win"": Northeast Rejoices As Citizenship Amendment Bill Goes Off Rails",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/northeast-rejoices-as-citizenship-amendment-bill-goes-off-rails-1993239,en,"Celebrations broke out across the Northeast today as the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill-2016 lapsed before it could be ratified by the Rajya Sabha. The legislation had set off protests in the region, spurring violence and pitting communities against each other. But it's over, at least for now. Like a bad dream. The Citizenship Amendment Bill will lapse on June 3, when the term of the present Lok Sabha ends. The 17th Lok Sabha has to be constituted before that date, in the wake of the upcoming parliamentary poll in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying hard to score a re-election. While bills that remain pending in the Rajya Sabha after being introduced there are not affected by the dissolution of the lower house, those that get stuck in the upper house while coming through the Lok Sabha route do lapse. The opposition had been opposing the provisions of the two bills in the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP-led government lacks numbers. The Citizenship Amendment Bill-2019 was intended at providing Indian citizenship to all immigrants - except Muslims - from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after a mere seven years of residence even if they do not have any documents. The legislation, passed by the Lok Sabha during the winter session on January 8, had been awaiting the Rajya Sabha's approval. The development has given rise to celebrations across the Northeast, especially in the opposition camp. ""This is the victory of secular India versus communal India. We have defeated this bill, which the BJP was trying to push despite it being against the constitution,"" said Assam Leader of Opposition Debabrata Saikia. The protesters are singing a similarly joyous tune. ""It is the victory of the indigenous people of the Northeast, who came together in protest,"" said Y Dilip Kumar, who was leading protests in Manipur. But the people remain wary of the BJP, a sentiment that gives the Congress a chance to reinvent itself in the region. The ruling party, for its part, hopes to make the most of the short breather it has received from the anti-citizenship bill protests. The National People's Party, the BJP's key partner in the Northeast, feels a crisis has been averted. Party leaders said they would have had no option but to walk out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance if the bill was passed. ""Everybody from political parties to civil society groups stood together to oppose the bill. Today, the sentiments and the voice of the northeastern people have prevailed,"" said Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma, who led the regional parties' joint platform against the bill. ""Here, the message for politicians is that they should not forget that they are for the people, of the people and by the people,"" said Zubeen Garg, noted Assamese singer.

They have refused to be part of new division unless there is a six month rotation of offices between Kargil and Leh. All district offices in Kargil and Leh work under the Autonomous councils, and the resolution passed by LAHDC Kargil has created a serious challenge for the Governor's administration. The resolution says ""establishing the headquarters of Ladakh division at Leh has hurt sentiments of the people of Kargil"". It reads that it was unanimously resolved that the LHDC Kargil would strongly advocate to review and amendment of the government order for providing headquarters of Ladakh division on rotational basis. It says that LHDC Kargil has decided to spearhead mass civil disobedience against the Governor administration's order unless necessary amendments are made. The LAHDC also directed Deputy Commissioner Kargil that the government order about the creation of the division of Ladakh may not be entertained till necessary amendments are made into it. It said the LHDC Kargil will demand equal share for district Kargil in the establishment of directorate and administrative units. For the last three days all government departments in Kargil are closed as part of the protest against the government decision. Despite extreme freezing temperature at minus 17 degree Celsius, thousands marched on the streets of Kargil and many even spent Tuesday night under the open sky. The protesters blocked the entry of newly-appointed divisional commissioner of Ladkah into Kargil and forced him to go back to Leh. Jammu and Kashmir is under President's Rule. The decision on separating Ladkah region from Kashmir division was taken less than a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Leh. The BJP had won Ladakh parliament seat in 2014 elections but suffered huge reverses after its local lawmaker and several other senior leaders from Ladakh resigned from party in November last. The party is desperately trying to regain the lost ground before upcoming elections. While the decision was welcomed in Leh, the party is facing revolt in Kargil. It has also led to demands for separate administrative divisions in Pirpanjal and Chenab Valley regions.

Curfew Continues In Manipur Amid Protests Over Citizenship Amendment Bill,Curfew Continues In Manipur Amid Protests Over Citizenship Amendment Bill,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/curfew-continues-in-manipur-amid-protests-over-citizenship-amendment-bill-1992893,en,"Prohibitory orders imposed in Manipur's capital Imphal continued for the second day today even as defiant locals came out on the streets in large numbers to protest against the Citizenship  Amendment Bill, officials said. Security barriers have been put up in all VIP areas of the state capital, with police frisking vehicles and pedestrians in the busy localities, they said. Mobile internet services have been suspended in the state till Saturday in the wake of the continued protests. On Tuesday night, police had to fire tear gas shells and mock bombs at Kymagei and Takhel Leikai areas of the city to disperse a group of protesters, who raised slogans seeking the revocation of the bill, officials said. According to hospital sources and eyewitnesses, more than 10 people were injured in different parts of the city since Tuesday. There was, however, no police confirmation on the number of injured. Markets, schools, colleges and offices remained closed, officials said. The state capital falls in both Imphal East and Imphal West districts. In Imphal West , District Magistrate Naorem Praveen Singh barred local news channels from telecasting the agitations. Political parties in the Northeast, including the BJP allies, are vehemently opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill that was passed by the Lok Sabha on January 8. The Centre had said it will try to get it passed by the Rajya Sabha during the Budget Session. Notwithstanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attempts to assuage the concerns of various political parties that the proposed law will not compromise the interests of people of the region, Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma has threatened to pull his National Peoples Party out of the BJP-led NDA if the Rajya Sabha passes the Bill. Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh and his Arunachal Pradesh counterpart Pema Khandu met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday and requested him not to table the bill in the Rajya Sabha. Both Mr Khandu and Mr Singh are BJP chief ministers. The bill seeks to provide citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who fled persecution, after six years of residence in India, instead of 12 years, which is currently the norm, even if they do not possess any document. The indigenous people of the region are apprehending that if the law is enacted, it will endanger their livelihood and identity.

"Ashok Gehlot Government Gives 5% Quota To Gujjars, Says Over To Centre","Ashok Gehlot Government Gives 5% Quota To Gujjars, Says Over To Centre",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gujjar-reservation-bill-passed-in-rajasthan-assembly-promises-5-quota-1992959,en,"The Congress government in Rajasthan passed a bill earmarking 5 per cent reservation for Gujjars in jobs and education today amid a huge protest by the community, which has paralysed road and rail traffic since last week in parts of the state. The next step, Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said, is to approach the Central government for an amendment in the Constitution which would make its implementation possible. Rajasthan has already touched the 50 per cent ceiling on reservation placed by the Supreme Court. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have crossed fifty per cent quota. Also, parliament has just given 10 per cent quota to the Economically Backward Classes, Mr Pilot pointed out. ""We will pass this bill and send it to the Centre, so they can pass it with a Constitutional amendment like they have done in the 10 per cent quota case,"" Mr Pilot told the state assembly. ""We will go meet (BJP chief) Amit Shah when he comes to Jaipur, to ask him to have this passed"". Last month, the Centre had passed the bill that provided for 10 per cent reservation in jobs and education for the economically weaker sections in the general category. The bill was introduced as a constitutional amendment, which made the quota legally valid. The Gujjar agitation flared up soon after, with the community pointing out that the Congress had promised five per cent reservation to them in its election manifesto. The Gujjars, who comprise around 5 per cent of Rajasthan's population and are traditional supporters of the BJP, have been demanding quota since 2006. Although covered under the quota for Other Backward Classes, they demanded an extra 5 per cent quota for the community. Efforts have been made twice by BJP-led governments in the state to grant that quota under various heads. But it has been repeatedly struck down by the Rajasthan High Court. The last such effort was made in 2017, when the Vasundhara Raje government gave Gujjars 5 per cent reservation as a Most Backward Class and expanded the OBC quota to 26 per cent. ""We know that five per cent reservation has been overturned in the past. But now the circumstances are different,"" said Mr Pilot. ""The Centre has just crossed the 50 per cent limit. The path has been cleared"". The Congress has added a line to the Rajasthan Backward Classes Bill that says since the Centre has given 10 per cent reservation to the EWS sections in the General Category, the Rajasthan government proposes 5 per cent quota for the Most Backward Castes, which would include Gujjars and four other nomadic tribes.

""Welcome to Delhi, where democracy is alive and kicking, Didi!"" reads one of the hoardings, showing Ms Banerjee walking angrily, holding a picture of the beared, skull cap-wearing man. The posters feature caricatures of Ms Banerjee in her trademark white saree with a blue border. A number of such posters have been installed at many places in the capital, taking a swipe at Mamata Banerjee ahead of her joining the sit-in with leaders like Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejrwal and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu at Jantar Mantar this afternoon. Posters on Mamata Banerjee cropped up in central Delhi. "" Didi , smile openly here. You are in a democracy,"" reads another one. "" Didi , no one is going to prevent you from addressing people"", reads the caption of another poster (pun intended), showing her with a cloth bag on her shoulder - a skull cap-wearing man in it. She is also shown holding two dhols . The Mamata Banerjee posters were put up ""welcoming"" her to Delhi. This one in particular holds significance as tension between the BJP and Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress in West Bengal rose after her party refused to grant permission to senior BJP leaders to hold rallies in the state. The chief minister repeatedly denied permission for their helicopters to land at the rally grounds. The BJP has termed this move ""undemocratic"". Holding an election rally is the constitutional right of every political party, they had said. Today's protest in Delhi - hosted by Arvind Kejriwal -  is the second one in three weeks after Mamata Banerjee hosted 20-odd opposition parties at her Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) rally in Kolkata on January 19. The sit-in is being loosely labelled "" Mahagathbandhan 2.0 "".  Countless freedom fighters laid down their lives for our freedom and democracy.

Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda is in New Delhi; so is Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, his party colleague Praful Patel, DMK's Kanimozhi and National Conference leaders. Bihar leader Tejashwi Yadav is unwell. There is uncertainty over the Congress's attendance. While Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Mallikarjun Kharge had represented the party in Kolkata, the fact that the Delhi platform is being hosted by Mr Kejriwal is a sticky point.

As the top Congress leaders protested, paper jets were seen. The Congress leaders raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government before the report of national auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), was submitted in parliament today. The Rafale deal signed by PM Modi's government is 2.8 per cent cheaper than the one negotiated by previous Congress-led UPA government, says the report. Rahul Gandhi had slammed the CAG report, calling it "" Chowkidar (gatekeeper) Auditor General"" report. The CAG report does not include the controversial and key point of pricing, as the Defence Ministry maintained that these details could not be revealed. The parts in the report referring to cost are redacted, which may provoke fresh opposition attacks. Earlier today, the Congress president cited a report in The Hindu to claim that the prime minister's argument of better pricing and faster delivery of the jets to defend the deal has been ""demolished"". The PM defended his personal RAFALE bypass deal on 2 counts : 1. Better Price 2. Faster Delivery Both have been demolished by the revelations in the Hindu today. Watch my LIVE Press Conference on the #RafaleScam at 3.30 PM today. https://t.co/IzyCaHeyIM Mr Gandhi will address the media at 3:30 pm. Yesterday, Rahul Gandhi had alleged that PM Modi is ""acting as Anil Ambani's middleman"", citing an email that he said revealed the industrialist had visited Paris and met with the French Defence Minister 10 days before PM Modi went there and announced the 36-jet deal with France. Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence said in a statement that ""facts are being deliberately twisted and reality being ignored"" and that the visit had nothing to do with Rafale. A spokesperson says the industrialist visited France to discuss a deal for more than 100 Naval Utility Helicopters for which the government had sought information from international helicopter manufacturers in 2015. The Congress alleges that the government went for an overpriced deal for Rafale jets to benefit Anil Ambani, whose Reliance Defence is one of the offset partners for Rafale maker Dassault. Both Dassault and Anil Ambani have denied the Congress allegations. The Supreme Court in December refused to investigate the deal worth an alleged 8.7 billion dollars and rejected petitions that alleged corruption, including the choice of Anil Ambani's firm as domestic partner. But the opposition says the government concealed vital information.

Samajwadi Party members were up on their feet trying to raise the issue but Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu ordered that nothing would go on record. Mr Naidu said he cannot allow them to raise the issue as they have not given notice.

The capital city of Imphal falls under both Imphal East and Imphal West districts. The prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC in the two districts were imposed last night, officials said. Mobile internet services have also been suspended indefinitely.

Security forces also set up barricades on major roads. Markets, schools, colleges and offices were closed, the officials said. The controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is likely to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha either today or tomorrow. The bill, being opposed in the northeast even by parties that are allies of the BJP, was passed in Lok Sabha on January 8 and the Centre had said it will try to get the Rajya Sabha nod during the Budget session. The bill seeks to provide citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after six years of residence in India, instead of 12 years, which is the norm currently, even if they do not possess any document. The indigenous people of the region are apprehending that if the bill is enacted, it will endanger their livelihood and identity. Meanwhile, the 36-hour shutdown called to protest the bill is continuing in Jiribam district, affecting normal life since 5 am on Monday. The shutdown was called by the Peoples' Alliance Manipur (PAM), a conglomerate of several organisations.

Protests erupted yesterday evening when the divisional commissioner of newly-created division tried to visit Kargil but thousands marched on roads and blocked his entry into the town and forced him to go back. Centres decision of creating the division of Ladkah has snowballed into a major controversy. All political parties, social and religious groups from Kargil region have joined hands demanding review of the government order. They refuse to be part of new division unless there is six-month rotation of offices between Kargil and Leh. Even government employees have joined protests and all government offices in Kargil have been closed since yesterday. People in Kargil march in protest against creation of the separate Ladakh division There was total shutdown yesterday and people have been asked to continue their protests today and observe a complete shutdown. Residents of Kargil also held protests in Jammu. The protests led by Feroz Ahmad, chief executive councillor Ladakh Area Hill Development Council Kargil and Inayat Ali, Chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative council have threatened mass agitation if the decision taken by the governor is not reviewed. Jammu and Kashmir is under president's rule. The decision to separate Ladkah region from Kashmir division was taken less than a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Leh. BJP had won Ladakh parliament seat in 2014 elections but suffered huge reverses after its local MP and several other senior leaders from Ladakh resigned from party last November. The party is desperately trying to regain the lost ground before upcoming elections. While the decision was welcomed in Leh, the party is facing a revolt in Kargil. It has also led to demands for separate administrative divisions in Pirpanjal and Chenab Valley regions. While the National Conference and People's Democratic Party are strongly supporting separate divisions for these regions, the BJP has vehemently opposed it.

Mr Yadav was on way to the Allahabad University for a function, but was physically stopped by the police from boarding a special flight to Prayagraj, 200 km from Lucknow. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the government had taken action after a request from the university, which was apprehensive about a law and order situation. Mr Yadav's party called it an attempt to kill democracy. Within hours, protests swept through Prayagraj, Jaunpur, Jhansi, Kannauj, Balrampur, Jalaun, Azamgarh and Gorakhpur and state capital Lucknow. Samajwadi Party supporters on a spree of violence vandalised vehicles and clashed with the police when they  came to control the mob. In Prayagraj, parliamentarian Dharmendra Yadav was injured in lathicharge by the police, the party claimed. In state capital Lucknow, protesters gathered outside the assembly complex and the Governor's House. Others rushed to the airport, the Ground Zero of the trouble. At Gorakhpur, the home turf of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, roads were blocked by a slogan shouting mob. Mr Yadav's tweets on his experience, and the photos and videos posted by his party's media cell, had also incensed the opposition parties, which took on the ruling BJP in the parliament and the state assembly. In Rajya Sabha, members of the SP and the other opposition parties held protests over the incident, disrupting the House proceedings. After a noisy protest in the assembly, Samajwadi Party legislators held a sit-in protest outside the Raj Bhawan against what they called the ""undemocratic behaviour"" of the BJP government. They relented only after Governor Ram Naik assured them of a meeting tomorrow. Photos tweeted by Mr Yadav showed police officers blocking his path to the flight. A video tweeted by his party showed the confrontation that followed. In Facebook post, Mr Yadav dubbed it the ""remote control politics of two-and-a-half-men"". ""I understand the need to ensure the safety of people and property and would never do something to endanger either knowingly.

The hilltop temple has opened for five days till February 17 for the monthly pujas during the Malayalam month of Kumbam, temple authorities on Monday said. Several special rituals including ''kalabhabhishekam'', ''sahasrakalasam'' and ''laksharchana'' would be performed during the five days at the shrine, the ''sanctum sanctorum'' of which would was opened by chief priest Vasudevan Nampoothiri this evening. Tantri (head priest) Kandararu Rajeevaru would also be present during the time of pujas, they said. The state police has stepped up vigil in and around Sabarimala in view of possible protests by Sangh outfits against the entry of women, belonging to the traditionally barred age group. They said certain restrictions had already been imposed in areas from Nilackal, the base camp to Sannidhanam (temple complex) to ensure smooth darshan for devotees. ""Considering the untoward incidents caused by various organisations in areas around Sabarimala when the shrine was opened for the Thulamasa puja and the protests over the Supreme Court order allowing entry of women of all ages into the shrine, certain restrictions have been imposed in areas to ensure smooth darshan for devotees,"" an official release said. Devotees and reporters would be allowed to travel from Nilackal to Pamba and Sannidhanam only after 10 am on February 12, it said. The BJP and Sangh Parivar outfits, which had spearheaded the agitations against implementation of the September 28 Supreme Court verdict permitting women of all age groups into the shrine, are yet to reveal whether they would try to block young women. The areas in and around the hilltop shrine had witnessed widespread violence after the CPI(M)-led LDF government decided to implement the apex court order allowing women of menstrual age into the temple.

Relations between Japan and South Korea, both U.S. allies, have amid an intensifying row over their wartime history. That includes Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean peninsula and its use of comfort women, many of them Korean. South Korea's National Assembly Speaker Moon Hee-sang said in an interview with Bloomberg last week Japanese Emperor Akihito, ""as the son of the main culprit of war crimes"", should apologise to the women before he steps down at the end of April. That would be a sign that Tokyo wanted to end the prolonged dispute, Moon said. Japan fought World War Two in the name of Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference in Tokyo on Tuesday that Moon's comments were ""extremely regrettable"". ""We strongly protested as his remarks have absolutely inappropriate content and are extremely regrettable,"" Suga said. ""At the same time, we demanded an apology and withdrawal of his remarks."" South Korea's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Moon was highlighting the need for Tokyo to show a ""sincere attitude"" to heal wounds. South Korea reached a settlement with Japan to resolve the dispute in 2015, in which Japan apologised to victims and provided 1 billion yen ($9 million) to a fund to help them. But some victims refused to take the money, saying the apology was not sincere, and Seoul's current administration said in 2017 that the deal was flawed. ""Our government will continue making efforts to foster future-oriented relations, while promoting a wise solution for historical legacy issues,"" ministry spokesman Roh Kyu-deok told a briefing. Relations between the two East Asia neighbours have also deteriorated since South Korea's top court ruled last year in favour of South Koreans seeking compensation from Japanese firms for wartime forced labour. South Korea also complained after a Japanese patrol aircraft made what Seoul described as an ""intimidating"" pass over one of its warships last month, adding to the tension between the two sides.

The Bill will be moved by Home Minister Rajnath Singh. Amid disruptions in the house, the government is expected to make one last effort to push this Bill through the Rajya Sabha today. The states in the northeast including Meghalaya, Assam, Mizoram and Manipur, have been seeing wide scale protests ever since the controversial Bill was introduced and passed in Lok Sabha in January. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 will amend the laws governing citizenship, formed in 1955, to grant Indian nationality to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who fled religious persecution from the three neighbouring countries and entered India before December 31, 2014. The political parties and the civil society opposing the proposed law say it would allow citizenship to illegal Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, who came to the state after March 1971, in violation to the Assam Accord, 1985. Illegal migration is a sensitive issue in the northeast, where tribals and other ethnic communities wish to keep out the outsiders. ""The burden of those persecuted migrants will be shared by the whole country. Assam alone should not have to bear the entire burden,"" Union minister Rajnath Singh had said while responding to the debate on the Bill in Lok Sabha. ""The government of India is committed to give all help to the state government and people of Assam,"" he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said his government is committed towards safeguarding the rights and interests of the people of the northeast. ""Those who sit in AC rooms in Delhi, who fight us in the parliament are spreading misinformation. But the BJP is committed to protecting the culture and resources of Assam and the northeast.

Tez Hazarika, who is based in the US, said in a statement that he was unhappy how the centre planned to pass the ""painfully unpopular"" Bill which was against his father's beliefs and position. ""I believe that my father's name and words are being invoked and celebrated publicly while plans are afoot to pass a painfully unpopular bill regarding citizenship that is actually undermining his documented position. It would in reality be in direct opposition to what Bhupenda believed in his heart of hearts,"" Tez Hazarika said.

""I go on record here to answer that A), I have not received any invitation so far there is nothing to reject, and B), how the center moves on this matter far outweighs in importance the awarding and receiving of such national recognition - a display of short lived cheap thrills,"" Tez Hazarika said in his statement.

A Gujjar leader warned that nobody will leave till their demands are met. ""We will leave only after getting 5 per cent reservation. I would request the government not to do anything which can provoke the people of Rajasthan. People are waiting for my instructions. Let's sort it out in a peaceful manner. The sooner the better,"" Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla said today. The Congress had promised the Gujjars 5 per cent reservation in its election manifesto and it is now bound to deliver, say protesters. Scores of people from the Gujjar community in Rajasthan, led by the Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (GASS), have been protesting at railway tracks at Sawai Madhopur demanding implementation of the 5 per cent reservation that was promised to them by the state government. They have even set up tents around the tracks. The protest has severely affected traffic on the highways and train movement along the Delhi-Mumbai line. The agitation turned violent on Sunday as the protesters clashed with the police personnel near Dholpur, officials said. They have blocked the Agra National Highway near Sikandara today. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that his government was ready to hold talks with Gujjars, but condemned the violence and disruption of road and train traffic. ""The government is ready to open discussions but sitting on railway tracks as part of protest is unethical,"" Mr Gehlot said and urged them to submit a memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""We did our best for them during my last tenure as the chief minister. We spoke to them and introduced 1 per cent reservation for the Gujjar community. We also tried to give them 5 per cent reservation. However, the High Court cancelled the same. Now they can start discussions with the Centre for 5 per cent reservation as it requires constitutional amendments,"" Mr Gehlot said. A Rajasthan minister also urged the protesters not to resort to violence and protest peacefully. ""I would also like to appeal to Bainsla ji to send his team for dialogue, and we will discuss as to how their demands can be met within limits of the constitution,"" Bhanwar Lal, the minister, said according to news agency ANI. Like the chief minister, Mr Lal also tried to steer the protesters towards the centre. ""We're not saying no, but our government is only 45-day-old. I would urge the Gujjar community to pressurise the Prime Minister to give five per cent reservation, the way they gave 10 per cent reservation to the general category,"" he said. Ahead of the general elections, a bill to provide 10 per cent quota in jobs and education to candidates who belong to the economically weaker sections in the general category, was passed by both the Houses last month. The latest law on this triggered the Gujjar agitation. According to the police, unidentified men fired around 10 shots in the air during the blockade on Agra-Morena highway on Sunday. When protesters threw stones, the police had to fire tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. Five policemen were injured and three police vehicles, including a bus, were also set on fire. No arrests have been made so far, a senior police officer said. Section 144 has been imposed in Dholpur, Dausa, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur and Karauli after violence being reported on Sunday. According to the railway authorities, as many as 18 trains were cancelled in Kota division of Central-West Railway on Sunday. The Railways has already announced cancellation of 37 trains between February 11 and 13. The Rajasthan government led by Vasundhara Raje had assured the Gujjar community of 5 per cent reservation in a special category in 2017 after a bout of agitation. It had planned to expand the reservation for Other Backward Classes from 21 per cent to 26 per cent and to give 5 per cent reservation to Gujjars and other castes. After the expansion, however, the total reservation in the state would have crossed the 50 per cent ceiling set by the Supreme Court. The bill to this effect, which was introduced in the monsoon session of the state assembly in 2017, was put on hold by the Rajasthan High Court after an appeal against it.

He goes to Andhra, he lies, he goes to the Northeast, he lies,"" the Congress president added. The Hindu newspaper has reported that provisions for anti-corruption penalties and an escrow account for payments were dropped days before the Rafale deal was signed, in what it calls ""major and unprecedented concessions"" from a government that has repeatedly stressed on fighting corruption in defence deals. The newspaper had earlier reported on defence ministry objections to "" parallel negotiations "" conducted by the Prime Minister's Office. The Congress alleges that the government finalised an overpriced deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets at an inflated price to benefit Anil Ambani, whose inexperienced defence firm was recommended as an offset partner for Dassault, the company manufacturing the aircraft.

Opposition Rallies Against Modi Government At N Chandrababu Naidu's Fast,Opposition Rallies Against Modi Government At N Chandrababu Naidu's Fast,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lok-sabha-election-2019-opposition-rallies-against-modi-government-at-n-chandrababu-naidus-fast-1991644,en,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu's daylong fast demanding special status for his state on Monday became a rallying point for various opposition leaders who visited the protest venue to back him and attack the central government. Congress president Rahul Gandhi, National Congress chairperson Farooq Abdullah, NCP's Majeed Memon, Trinamool Congress's Derek O' Brien, DMK's Tiruchi Siva and Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav were among those who met the TDP chief to express their support. The TDP president is demanding that the centre fulfil promises made during Andhra Pradesh's bifurcation in 2014 and alleges that PM Modi was not following ''raj dharma'' by denying the state special status. ""The prime minister has stolen from the people from Andhra Pradesh and he has given that money to Anil Ambani. That is the fact of the matter,"" Mr Gandhi alleged at the protest venue Andhra Bhavan in an apparent reference to the Rafale fighter jet deal with France. The government and Anil Ambani have rejected Mr Gandhi's allegations of corruption in the deal. Derek O'Brien recalled PM Modi's speech in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, on Sunday and said he didn't talk about development or special category status but ""started a personal attack"". ""Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones at others,"" he said. The PM said in his rally that Mr Naidu was indeed a senior, but only in losing elections, switching alliances and ditching his father-in-law NT Rama Rao. Lashing out at the prime minister, Omar Abdullah said, ""Modi has stooped so low, he's making personal attacks against Naidu, who is doing a great service to the country."" ""The Jammu-Srinagar highway is closed for six days. They cannot clear the 30km road, but they want to rule the country,"" he added. Adding his voice to the chorus of criticism, Mr Memon alleged that the central government was meting out step motherly treatment to the state and the BJP was attacking Mr Naidu because he has taken the lead in uniting rival parties against it. ""We will show the BJP its place in the elections. I assure you on behalf of Sharad Pawar ji,"" Mr Memon stated. Mulayam Singh Yadav said he was not well but had come to show endorse Mr Naidu's stand. ""Naidu is fighting the battle for the poor, the farmers and all those who are oppressed,"" he added. Stating that Mr Naidu was fighting for a just cause, DMK leader Siva said the Modi government would be ousted in three months. ""The powers of the state are being encroached upon...the rights of the minorities are being violated."" The TDP had walked out the BJP-led NDA last year protesting the ""injustice"" done to Andhra Pradesh after its bifurcation. Mr Naidu's ''Dharma Porata Deeksha'' (a day-long protest for justice), which began at 8 am, is likely to end at around 8 pm. He will also submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind on February 12. Mr Naidu paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Raj Ghat and also to the Ambedkar Statue at the Andhra Pradesh Bhavan before sitting on the hunger strike.

The party has already sent a letter to the city police seeking permission for the dharna at the Metro Channel in the heart of the city between February 21 and 23, BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said. An email would also be sent to the police on this matter, he said. The ""Save Democracy"" dharna will raise demand of""restoring democracy in the state"", he said. Mr Basu said, ""Whenever in the past we had asked for permission to organise a sit-in demonstration at the Metro Channel, the police denied us permission citing traffic rules. But if the Trinamool Congress was allowed to organise a dharna there, why can't we do it?"" Ms Banerjee was on dharna from February 3 to 5 at the Metro channel in Esplanade area to ""save the Constitution"" after the CBI's failed bid to question Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with chit fund cases.

The protesters had set up camp at the market to demand the scrapping of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill when they were fired upon with tear gas by the authorities, which left six of them injured. Hundreds of women from the four women's markets in Imphal city, who staged a sit-in protest in the main market complex from Saturday morning, have refused to return home. They said they will continue to stay at the market till Wednesday when it is expected that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill would be taken up in Rajya Sabha. The Lok Sabha has already passed it.

""The government is ready to open discussions with the agitating community,"" Mr Gehlot said adding that sitting on railway tracks as part of protest was unethical. The agitation for reservation that entered its third day on Sunday turned violent as the protesters clashed with the police personnel near Dholpur, officials said. The police had to fire tear gas shells to disperse the protesters when they began pelting stones. Three police vehicles were also set on fire. Five policemen were injured in the stone pelting. No arrests have been made, so far, senior police official Mohan Lal Lather said. Three separate cases have been registered and investigations are on. Those flouting norms shall be dealt with iron hand, the police officer said. The Chief Minister said the government would look into the issue and probe the violence that erupted in Dholpur on Sunday. The Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (GASS) launched agitation on Friday and started blocking highways and traffic on the Delhi-Mumbai rail route. They are demanding five per cent reservation in government jobs and education institutions. Mr Lather said control rooms have been set up in the violence-hit areas of Rajasthan. On the Gujjars' threat to intensify the agitation on Monday, Mr Lather said: ""We have deputed additional forces in the violence-prone areas to tackle any untoward incident."" Early in the day, p rotesters tried to block the National Highway No. 3 near Dholpur, but the police intervened resulting into clashes. On Saturday, Rajasthan Tourism Minister Vishwendra Singh and IAS officer Neeraj K. Pawan visited GASS chief, Col. Kirori Singh Bainsla (retd) near Malarna Dungar in the Sawai Madhopur district to hold negotiations. But these failed to make any headway. While the rail traffic on the Delhi-Mumbai route remained disrupted for the third consecutive day on Sunday, the Kota Railway Division has cancelled 28 trains till February 13, and diverted 37 trains. Around 18 trains scheduled to run on Sunday, 10 on Monday, 12 on Tuesday and 15 on Wednesday were cancelled, a Northern Railway official said. GASS chief Mr Bainsla blamed anti-social elements, who have become a part of the protest, for the violence.

The protest comes just a day after PM Modi held a rally in Andhra Pradesh, roasting Mr Naidu for allegedly wasting public money on political campaigns. He ended the day-long fast by drinking a glass of water offered by former prime minister HD Deve Gowda. ""(Former PM) Atal Bihari Vajpayee said '' Raj Dharma '' was not followed in Gujarat (during the 2002 riots). Now, ""Raj Dharma"" is not being followed in the case of Andhra Pradesh. We have been denied what is rightfully ours. If you don't get it done, we know how to get it done,"" the 68-year-old Chief Minister said. Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had referred to ""Raj Dharma"" to remind then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi of his duty during the 2002 Gujarat riots. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP), led by Mr Naidu, had quit the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance or NDA last year over what its chief described as ""injustice"" done to Andhra Pradesh after its bifurcation. Mr Naidu accused the Narendra Modi government of going back on a long-awaited promise of special state status for Andhra Pradesh which would grant it a greater share of funds. Chandrababu Naidu said the hunger strike was organised to ask PM Modi why he had not kept his word on Andhra Pradesh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, had claimed on Sunday that he had gone far beyond offering the special status to Andhra Pradesh. ""As Chandrababu Naidu couldn't develop the state nor give accounts for his expenditure, he is cooking up lies,"" he said. The TDP chief began the ''Dharma Porata Deeksha'' (a day-long protest for justice) at the Andhra Pradesh Bhavan around 8:30 am after paying respects to the Mahatma Gandhi memorial at Rajghat. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah were among prominent opposition leaders who joined Mr Naidu at the protest. ""Wherever the PM goes, he lies. He goes to Andhra he lied, he goes to northeast, he lies. He has absolutely no credibility left. PM Modi has stolen from the people of Andhra Pradesh,"" Mr Gandhi said. The Chief Minister will also submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday, an official statement said. Andhra Pradesh ministers, TDP lawmakers, parliamentarians, members of state employee associations, social organisations and student organisations will join the fast, the party said. Last year, the chief minister had observed a fast in Vijayawada on his birthday on April 20 demanding special status for the state. After quitting the NDA in March last year, the TDP had also moved a ''no-confidence motion'' in the Monsoon session of parliament in July, which was defeated. Over five years ago, Chandrababu Naidu had launched an indefinite fast at the Andhra Pradesh Bhavan. If a separate state was to be carved out then both should get equal justice, he had demanded. He was forcibly taken to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital on the fifth day after his health deteriorated.

Kargil Residents Brave Bone-Chilling Cold To Protest Centre's Ladakh Division Move,Kargil Residents Brave Bone-Chilling Cold To Protest Centre's Ladakh Division Move,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kargil-residents-brave-bone-chilling-cold-to-protest-ladakh-division-move-1991253,en,"Creating a separate administrative division for Ladakh with its headquarters at Leh is backfiring on the centre. Two days after the government issued the controversial order, thousands of Kargil residents marched in the bone-chilling cold to demand that the decision be reviewed immediately. They have refused to be part of the newly created division unless there is six-month rotation of offices between Leh and Kargil. According to the order, the administration has sanctioned the creation of a separate administrative and revenue division comprising Leh and Kargil districts with its headquarters at Leh. Ladakh was part of Kashmir division until now. ""Give it to Leh district if you want to, but then let Kargil remain part of Kashmir division. This is absolute injustice, and we will not accept this. The decision must be reviewed, and the headquarters should be on six-month rotation,"" said Feroz Ahmad Khan, Chief Executive Councillor of the Ladakh Area Hill Development Council, Kargil. All elected leaders from Kargil, including Mr Khan, have threatened to resign if the order is not withdrawn. They claim that the demand for a separate Ladakh division had actually been made by the people of Kargil, and the government's decision to install the divisional headquarters at Leh was done with the aim of creating political strife in the region. Meanwhile, largescale agitations are being taken out in Kargil, and temperatures as low as minus 21 degrees Celsius are doing little to deter them. All political, social and religious organisations in the region have called for a shutdown tomorrow, and threatened to launch an agitation if the decision is not reviewed. The government's decision has led to other repercussions too, with demands for separate administrative divisions cropping up from Jammu's Pirpanjal and Chenab Valley too. While the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party strongly back the creation of separate divisions for these regions, the BJP is vehemently opposed to it. The decision on separating Ladakh from the Kashmir division was taken less than a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Leh . Although the BJP had won the Ladakh parliamentary seat in 2014, it suffered huge reverses when several senior party leaders - including its local parliamentarian - resigned in November. The party is desperately trying to regain lost ground before the upcoming elections. While the decision has been welcomed in Leh, it faces huge opposition in Kargil. ""If they don't review this decision, the entire Kargil unit of the BJP will resign,"" said BJP district president Mohammad Ali Majaz.

Kerala Nuns Allege Rape Accused Bishop's Hand In Transfer Orders,Kerala Nuns Allege Rape Accused Bishop's Hand In Transfer Orders,https://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/kerala-nuns-allege-rape-accused-bishop-franco-mulakkals-hand-in-transfer-orders-1991247,en,"Rape-accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal, who was relieved of his pastoral responsibilities by Pope Francis, still interferes with the administrative matters of Jalandhar diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, nuns protesting against him alleged in Kerala today. ""We believe that Bishop Angelo is the apostolic administrator of Jalandhar diocese. But when we see the kind of letters (being issued by the diocese PRO and Missionaries of Jesus congregation head), we doubt whether Bishop Franco still wields power in the diocese,"" the representative of the protesting nuns told reporters at Kuravilangad near Kottayam. Their statement comes a day after Jalandhar diocese PRO Father Peter Kavumpuram, who is allegedly close to Bishop Mulakkal, issued a clarification statement countering an e-mail issued to nuns by its apostolic administrator Bishop Angelo Ruffino Gracias. In his e-mail, Bishop Angelo had assured the five nuns , who are staying with the rape survivor nun, that ""there will be no move from the diocese of Jalandhar to oust"" them from the Kuravilangad convent in Kottayam district as long as they are needed for the court case. The Bishop wrote to the nuns after they complained to him against the head of their congregation, Missionaries of Jesus under the Jalandhar diocese, for issuing transfer orders to the four of them who took part in the protest demanding the arrest of the bishop. Another nun, who is staying with the rape survivor, was asked to report to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation's Jalandhar convent and meet its Superior General Sister Regina Kandamthottu on January 26. Peter Kavumpuram issued a clarification statement countering Bishop Angelo hours after his e-mail communication was made public, saying even though the congregation of Missionaries of Jesus is of diocesan right, the internal running of the congregation is left to the Superior General and her council. ""The Bishop of Jalandhar does not normally interfere unless the overall interests of the church demand such interference. By this clarification the Apostolic Administrator has not interfered in the internal affairs of this congregation, therefore the order to return to their rightful communities by the Mother General is not cancelled but stands,"" the statement quoting Father Kavumpuram had said. The protesting nuns stay with the survivor nun in the convent in Kuravilangad. Talking to reporters today, the nun representing the protesters rejected the clarification statement issued by Father Kavumpuram, saying they would not move out of the convent in Kuravilangad. ""Clarification statement is not acceptable for us. We will continue to stay in this convent till the case is over,"" she said. The congregation of nuns -- Missionaries of Jesus -- had directed the nuns to join their previously-assigned convents, according to the transfer orders issued between March and May last year. The nuns were served notice by the superior general, urging them to take up their assigned responsibilities as befitting members of the congregation. The four nuns had earlier written to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking his intervention to ensure that their transfer orders were not effected till the trial of the case was over. The survivor nun had also written a separate letter to the chief minister, seeking his help in the matter. ""Their aim is to single me out and to harass and torture me. My life will be in danger if such a situation arises,"" she said in her letter. The nuns on Saturday had joined ''Save our Sisters'' forum to stage a protest against the transfer orders issued by the congregation. A tense situation prevailed at the protest site when a group of people opposing the nuns'' protest reached there and raised slogans against them. The group was removed from the spot, police sources said. The protest led by the nuns and the Catholic reformist forums in Kochi in September last year had led to a public outrage and demands for action against the bishop. Bishop Mulakkal, a senior member of the Roman Catholic clergy in India, was arrested last year following allegations by a nun that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted her at the Kuravilangad convent between 2014 and 2016, a charge denied by him.

"Demonstrator At Paris ""Yellow Vest"" March Loses Hand","Demonstrator At Paris ""Yellow Vest"" March Loses Hand",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/demonstrator-at-paris-yellow-vest-march-loses-hand-1991171,en,"A ""yellow vest"" demonstrator lost his hand during clashes with police outside the main parliament building in Paris on Saturday, witnesses told AFP, during a 13th weekend of anti-government protests across France. Despite a drop in numbers from the massive turnouts of the first demonstrations in November, tens of thousands still turned out in cities across the country to protest against French President Emmanuel Macron's policies. Clashes broke out outside the National Assembly building in Paris after a march from the Champs-Elysees avenue arrived there. While many demonstrators marched peacefully, some masked activists tried to break down barriers outside the parliament while others urinated nearby. Masked men threw projectiles at police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. As the march continued, vandals burned rubbish bins as well as cars -- mainly luxury models -- vandalising bus shelters, cash machines and shop windows along the route. One of the torched cars belonged to Sentinelle, France's anti-terrorism unit. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner expressed his ""indignation and disgust"" in a tweet. A man was being held for questioning over the blaze, Paris prosecutors said. Volunteer medics at the National Assembly told AFP that a man had had his hand ripped off during the clashes between police and protesters. One witness who filmed the incident, 21-year-old Cyprien Royer, said the victim was a yellow jacket photographer taking pictures of people trying to break down the barriers protecting the entrance to the National Assembly. He said he was hit in the calf by a type of stun grenade as the cops attempted to disperse people. ""He wanted to bat it away so it didn't explode by his leg -- and it went off when he touched it,"" he added. Paris police said the man had lost four fingers. Officers had arrested 39 people and 21 were being held in custody, they added on Saturday night. Disputed Turnout ""We mustn't give up,"" said pensioner Serge Mairesse, from Aubervilliers, just outside Paris. This was the 11th time he had marched with the movement, he told AFP. ""We have to win to have more social and fiscal justice in this country,"" said Mairesse, who was carrying a placard calling for the reimposition of a wealth tax on high earners repealed by Macron. At the march in the southeast city of Lyon, Benard, a 56-year-old computer technician, expressed scepticism about Macron's ""great debate"" initiative designed to address people's grievances. ""It's all very good, the great debate, but we want something concrete: fewer taxes, more purchasing power. We'll be here every Saturday of the year if we have to."" Thousands of protesters turned out Saturday in the French Mediterranean ports of Marseille and Montpellier and also in Bordeaux and Toulouse in the southwest -- strongholds of the movements -- as well as several cities in the north and west of France. In the eastern city of Saint Etienne, eight police officers were slightly hurt during clashes with some protesters on the fringes of the march there, local police said. Interior ministry figures put the turnout across France at 51,400, of whom 4,000 marched in Paris, slightly down on the previous week's figures. But last week's official estimates were disputed both by march organisers and contradicted by an independent estimate carried out for news media, which gave a higher estimate. The first yellow vest day of protest in November brought 282,000 people out on to the streets across France, according to government figures. But a YouGov poll of 1,037 people issued on Thursday suggested that nearly two out of three people in France (64 percent) still support the movement. It was carried out on January 30 and 31. French prosecutors are meanwhile investigating a series of attacks on homes belonging to politicians in Macron's Republic on the Move party, ranging from vandalism to arson. No one has been hurt and no individual or group has so far been implicated in the incidents. Government and opposition politicians have condemned the attacks.

Rajasthan Police Use Tear Gas On Gujjar Quota Protesters,Rajasthan Police Use Tear Gas On Gujjar Quota Protesters,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rajasthan-police-open-fire-on-gujjar-agitators-on-day-3-of-quota-protests-1991243,en,"The Rajasthan police on Sunday fired tear gas shells to prevent members of the Gujjar community--who have been protesting for their demand of five per cent quota in jobs and education-- from blocking a highway connecting Dholpur to Gwalior. The police, however, were unsuccessful in their attempt to stop the agitators from blocking the road. The incident took place in Rajasthan's Dholpur as the Gujjar protest entered its third day. As the protesters moved to occupy National Highway 3, they had a run-in with the police, which baton-charged to stop them. The police later fired tear gas shells on them. Three police vehicles have been torched by the protesters, the police said. The leader of the community, Kirori Singh Bainsla, started a sit-in protest on Friday along with his supporters on the railway tracks in Rajasthan's Sawai Madhopur district, demanding reservation for five communities including Gujjars. He said the state government had promised five per cent reservation to the community in its election manifesto. Vijay Bainsla, another Gujjar leader, said they have been waiting for talks with the government since last 20 days on their demand. He said agitators blocked Jaipur-Delhi, Jodhpur-Bhilwara, Ajmer-Bhilwara highway on Saturday. The agitation comes nearly a month after 10 per cent quota for the economically weaker sections in the general category in jobs and education was cleared by parliament. The move was introduced as a constitutional amendment, passed in parliament and enacted in a matter of days. Members of the Gujjar community blocked railway tracks on the second day of their agitation on Saturday. Agitating Gujjars sat on railway tracks at Malarna Doongar near Sawai Madhopur, leading to the cancellation of 23 trains and the re-routing of 20.

Indian Doctors In UK Protest Doubling Of Healthcare Surcharge On Migrants,Indian Doctors In UK Protest Doubling Of Healthcare Surcharge On Migrants,https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indian-doctors-in-uk-protest-doubling-of-healthcare-surcharge-on-migrants-1991148,en,"UK-based Indian doctors and healthcare professionals are campaigning against what they describe as an ""unfair"" doubling of a health surcharge imposed on professionals from outside European Union (EU) living and working in Britain. The ""Immigration Health Surcharge"" was introduced in April 2015 and from December last year it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year. It is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the country's state-funded National Health Service (NHS). The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), the UK's largest representative body for Indian-origin doctors, is lobbying the UK Home Office for a rethink over the charge, arguing that it would have an adverse impact on their attempt to recruit more healthcare professionals from India to meet staff shortages in the NHS. ""Clinicians wishing to work in the UK are already facing burdensome processes relating to regulation and immigration, and this surcharge is only going to see UK losing out on quality healthcare professionals from non-EU countries,"" notes a letter from BAPIO president Ramesh Mehta and secretary Parag Singhal, sent to UK home secretary Sajid Javid last week. ""The current policy adversely affects the attraction of working in the NHS and will sabotage our own requirements of providing quality health services to our patients. Therefore, in the interest of patient safety and improved morale of the immigrant workforce, we request that this unfair and highly discriminatory health surcharge for NHS-employed professionals should be reversed with immediate effect,"" the letter states. According to the organisation, one in 11 NHS clinical posts are currently unfilled, rising to one in eight for nursing vacancies, and the severe shortage is likely to grow to around 250,000 by 2030. Doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals from countries like India are often referred to as the ""backbone"" of the UK's healthcare system as they take up critical posts across hospitals and clinics in the country, the BAPIO pointed out. BAPIO has been at the centre of organising fellowship programmes for doctors from India to fill NHS shortages while completing their training in Britain as a ""win-win"" arrangement. But it fears these efforts would be hit as a result of the additional financial burden imposed by the health surcharge. ""These professionals are paying their taxes, including National Insurance (NI) contributions, in addition to providing quality health services in over-stretched hospitals. Such an additional burden will make them feel demoralised and discriminated,"" said Prof. Singhal. The health surcharge is payable by nationals from countries like India if they seek to live in the UK for six months or more, or to extend their stay. The payment is made at the time the immigration application is made and is payable annually until such time as the person is granted indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK, or returns to their home country at the end of their visa period. Short-term migrants, including tourists on visitor visas, are charged differently for secondary care treatment by the NHS at the point of visa access. Other groups have also questioned the extremely high surcharge on the grounds that it amounted to ""double taxation"" for long-term migrants, who are already expected to make tax contributions towards the care system. ""Most people who do move here will work and they will pay tax. So doubling this charge is a form of double taxation. People are going to be ending up paying for the NHS twice,"" said Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Migrants. The UK government says since the surcharge was introduced in 2015, it has raised over 600 million pounds, which has been ploughed back into health budgets. It expects to raise an estimated 220 million pounds in extra funding with the doubling of the surcharge, with the funds aimed at ""sustaining and protecting"" the country''s healthcare system. ""We welcome use of the NHS by long term residents who still need leave to remain, but we believe it is right that they make a fair and proportionate contribution to its long-term sustainability,"" a UK Home Office spokesperson said. ""Parliament agrees and has approved the order we proposed to increase the immigration health surcharge so it better reflects the actual costs to the NHS,"" the spokesperson added.

Renowned French Author And Illustrator Tomi Ungerer Dies At 87,Renowned French Author And Illustrator Tomi Ungerer Dies At 87,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/renowned-french-author-and-illustrator-tomi-ungerer-dies-at-87-1991050,en,"The renowned French cartoonist, author and illustrator Tomi Ungerer, a lifelong activist who protested against racial segregation, the Vietnam war and the election of US President Donald Trump, has died at the age of 87 in Ireland, his former adviser told AFP on Saturday. ""He died in the night and his wife called me this (Saturday) morning on the phone,"" Robert Walter, his former adviser and a friend ""for 35 years"" said, adding that Ungerer died at his daughter's home. ""He was an all-round genius, a man who was talented in everything. He loved literature. He used to say 'I write about what I draw and I draw what I write',"" he said. Originally from Alsace in eastern France, Ungerer lived in the United States and Canada before settling in Ireland. He was obsessed with books from an early age. ""For me, if there was a heaven it would be a library,"" he told AFP in a 2016 interview, adding that he was ""brought up on reading"". Ungerer's oeuvre ranged from globally celebrated children's books like The Three Robbers and The Moon Man to erotic drawings as well as satirical paintings and political posters. He wrote in three languages: English, French and German. He published over 140 books which have been translated into 30 languages. 'Subversive' Ungerer's social activism and his often irreverent writings led to some of his work being branded ""subversive"" by critics. Born into a family of watchmakers in 1931 in the Alsatian city of Strasbourg, Ungerer lost his father when he was three-years-old. He witnessed the annexation of Alsace by Germany during World War II and the subsequent imposition of German and Nazi ideology in schools, which he recounted later in autobiographical works. After failing the second part of the baccalaureate exam -- in a school report, his headmaster described him as a ""wilfully perverse and subversive individualist"" -- Ungerer hitchhiked to the North Cape in Norway. After the end of the war, Ungerer travelled across Europe and in 1956, he left for New York with 60 dollars in his pocket and what he later described as a ""trunk full of drawings and manuscripts"". The following year, after meeting the children's book editor Ursula Nordstrom at Harper and Row, his first children's book The Mellops Go Flying was published and became an immediate success. A range of works followed from the complete Mellop series to several prize-winning books and satirical works including Horrible and The Underground Sketchbook. He then worked for Playboy magazine as its food editor and also did several political posters including drawings for the election campaign of former German chancellor Willy Brandt's SPD party. Ungerer donated more than 11,000 original works of art, sculptures, books and toys to a museum devoted to his work and life, which opened in 2007 in his birthplace Strasbourg. Since then, the Tomi Ungerer Museum has been voted as one of the ten best museums in Europe by the Council of Europe. He was awarded the Legion of Honour by France in 1990 and was elevated to Commander of the Legion of Honour in 2018.

Protests In Andhra Pradesh Ahead Of PM Modi's Visit Tomorrow,Protests In Andhra Pradesh Ahead Of PM Modi's Visit Tomorrow,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/protests-await-prime-minister-narendra-modi-in-andhra-pradesh-1991006,en,"A day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Andhra Pradesh, protests were held at various places in the state today with protesters raising 'Modi go back' slogans. Protests were staged in 13 districts of the state by leaders and workers of the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Congress, Left parties, student groups and mass organisations fighting for the special category status for Andhra Pradesh. Carrying black flags, they took out rallies and staged sit-ins at different places. Some could also be seen shirtless. Leaders of the Left parties held protests by smashing empty pots in Vijayawada. They also threatened to disrupt Modi's rally in Guntur on Sunday. Addressing a meeting in the Nellore district today, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu said PM Modi had no right to visit the state as he betrayed Andhra Pradesh by not fulfilling the promise to accord special status and other commitments made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2014. He called upon the people to register their protests against PM Modi's visit. Claiming that people boycotted BJP President Amit Shah's visit to the Srikakulam district last week, Mr Naidu said a similar situation awaited PM Modi in Guntur. Communist Party of India (CPI) state Secretary K. Ramakrishna said PM Modi had no moral right to visit the state as he did not honour the commitments made in Parliament. CPI-M leader P. Madhu said party workers would hold protests with empty pots in Guntur to foil PM Modi's rally. He recalled how PM Modi had come to the stone laying ceremony of Amaravati, the new state capital, carrying a pot of soil and water and promised all help to the state. ""He has gone back on every promise he made,"" said Mr Madhu. State Congress chief Raghuveera Reddy said his party would organise protests with black flags across the state on Sunday. He appealed to all political parties to join the demonstrations. Meanwhile, security has been tightened in Guntur ahead of PM Modi's rally. The Special Protection Group (SPG) was busy giving final touches to the security arrangements in coordination with the state police. State BJP chief Kanna Laxminarayana alleged that the TDP and other parties were planning to disrupt the rally. He said PM Modi would expose the TDP government's corruption and counter its false propaganda by highlighting the steps taken by the Centre to help the state during the last four-and-a-half years. This will be PM Modi's first visit to Andhra Pradesh after the TDP pulled out of the BJP-led NDA last year.

Yes, he is senior to me in switching sides, forming new alliances and ""backstabbing"" his seniors - just the way he deceived his father-in-law (NT Rama Rao),"" said PM Modi. Mr Naidu is losing popularity in his state, alleged PM Modi. PM Modi accused the TDP chief of misusing public money for his several campaign trips and programmes. Turning to the state BJP chief, Kanna Lakshminarayana, he asked, ""who is footing the bill for today's event...BJP workers always pay for their own campaigns but he (Chandrababu Naidu) uses money from people's pocket for his campaigns?"", said PM Modi and added that the public must hold Mr Naidu accountable. The man who had promised ""sunrise"" for Andhra Pradesh is working to promote his son, N Lokesh, PM Modi charged. ""The Chief Minister promised the development of Amaravati but is now engaged in his own development,"" alleged PM Modi. Earlier, PM Modi landed in Vijaywada's Gannavaram airport, where he was received by the Governor. Breaking protocol, no one from Chandrababu Naidu 's cabinet was present at the airport. Only the state Chief Secretary and the police chief were there. After a rally in Guntur, PM Modi visited Tiruppur and Raichur later in the day. TDP, Congress and Left parties are protesting PM Modi's visit to the state and large posters of ""No more Modi""and ""Modi never again"" were seen on the roads. TDP protesters waved black flags and balloons, when a BJP convoy was on its way to the rally spot in Guntur. In some places, protesters burnt tyres and PM's effigies. TDP protesters burnt tyres on the road, protesting PM Modi's visit to Andhra Pradesh ""The Prime Minister came here to scold me. It is easy to criticise and run away...He did not do us any justice...Will we forgive him...They separated the state...The wound of separation has not yet healed and now they are making it worse,"" Mr Naidu lashed out today. He is upset with the Narendra Modi government and accused PM Modi of not keeping his promise of giving special category status to the state. ""It is a dark day...He is weakening the states and constitutional institutions. PMO's intervention in Rafael is disrespect to the nation,"" the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, one of PM Modi's strongest critics said on Saturday. The TDP chief also alleged that the YSR Congress is hand-in-glove with the BJP and helping them organise the ""crowd"". ""That is why Jaganmohan Reddy is not uttering a word against PM Modi's betrayal of Andhra Pradesh,"" he told party workers in a video conference. Chandrababu Naidu in black shirt as PM Modi campaigns in Andhra Pradesh Left party leader R Ramakrishna of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and P Madhu of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) said that PM Modi has no ""moral right"" to visit the state.

"As Northeast Simmers Over Citizenship Bill, PM Modi's ""We Care"" Message","As Northeast Simmers Over Citizenship Bill, PM Modi's ""We Care"" Message",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-northeast-simmers-over-citizenship-bill-pm-modis-we-care-message-1990991,en,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who landed in Assam's Guwahati amid black flag protests, tried to address people's concerns today about the citizenship bill , saying his party is committed to protecting the culture and resources of the northeast. Without naming any party, he said ""Those who sit in AC rooms in Delhi"" are spreading ""misinformation"" about the bill. The Citizenship Bill, one of the key projects of the government, envisages a smoother and quicker grant of citizenship to illegal migrants from the minority communities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after six years' stay in India. But it has had the northeast -- an area sensitive to the preservation of culture that entry of foreigners may endanger -- up in arms. The protests have spiked particularly in Assam, where inflow of illegal migrants from Bangladesh is a huge social and political issue. PM Modi earlier provided a broader context to the issue, saying those the bill would help are also ""children of Ma Bharati"". ""Be it from Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Bangladesh... they were all a part of India once... but after partition, when the country was divided, they became minorities in their own country, be it Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis, Christians, and Hindus... We must understand the pain of these people... they must now get their recognition as Indian citizens,"" he said today. The Congress has taken on the BJP over the Citizenship Bill, pointing out that while considering candidates for citizenship, the Bill only looks at religious persecution, not social or political discrimination. But the Prime Minister today took on the Congress, reminding the people that in the last 35 years, the Clause 6 of the Assam Accord -- which promises comprehensive safeguards to the cultural, social and linguistic identity -- has not been implemented. Before the BJP won the 2016 assembly elections, the Congress had ruled the state for 15 straight years. For 10 of those years, the party ruled at the Centre too. The row over the Citizenship Bill is seen to be a growing hurdle for the BJP in the northeast, which has a crucial role in PM Modi's ""Look East policy"" - the expansion of strategic ties across southeast Asia. From practically no footprint in the area, the BJP has managed to bring all seven states under its control over the last four years. But in the few short months since the bill was introduced, unrest has been spreading among the BJP allies in the northeast. Regional ally Asom Gana Parishad has ended its partnership with the BJP over the bill, which has already been passed by the Lok Sabha and could be tabled soon in the Rajya Sabha. Ten of its allies have decided to oppose the bill, indicating that if the Centre does not bend, they would walk out of the 13-party Northeast Democratic Alliance -the anti-Congress platform through which the BJP made inroads in the northeast. Even some of the BJP's own leaders in the area have spoken against the bill. Today, PM Modi detailed the initiatives that show his government's emphasis on the northeast. ""I am proud that under the BJP, two great personalities from Assam, Gopinath Bordoloi and Bhupen Hazarika were given Bharat Ratna. Our objective is 'infrapush northeast, digital push northeast'. In the interim budget, we have given a lot of emphasis on the development of the northeast. We have given 21 per cent hike in allocation for the northeast. Assam budget is widely talked about,"" he said. Get the latest election news , live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

Church Cancels Orders To Transfer Kerala Nuns Protesting Against Bishop,Church Cancels Orders To Transfer Kerala Nuns Protesting Against Bishop,https://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/church-cancels-orders-to-transfer-kerala-nuns-protesting-against-bishop-1990955,en,"Four Kerala nuns, who were transferred for allegedly campaigning against former Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal accused of sexually assaulting a nun in the state, don't need to move out of the convent where they are staying with the ""survivor nun"", the church said as it revoked their transfer orders on Friday. The order also cancels the warning letter or a summons to a fifth nun. The letter by Jalandhar Diocese Administrator Bishop Agnelo states, ""I am giving a directive to the General that she will not issue any letters to the five of you without my explicit permission... I like to assure the five of you that as far as lies within my power, there will be no move from the Diocese of Jalandhar to oust you from the convent as long as you are needed for the court case."" The nuns in Kerala had received their transfer orders in March 2018 by the Missionaries of Jesus Congregation, months after they had complained at several forums within the church against the bishop. Reminders followed last month as the nuns had refused to accept the directives. ""We are relieved that at least now the church is waking up to our need. Our demand is simple - we should be left  in peace, to live in the convent together , till we are fighting the case in the court"", one of the nuns told NDTV. The nuns announced the development during a protest organised by Save Our Sisters on Saturday in Kottayam as they demanded justice for the ""survivor"" nun. The nuns had earlier protested near Kerala High Court in September last year. Save Our Sisters, an umbrella organisation of several 'reformation organisations' within churches, has demanded that Franco Mullakkal must be 'defrocked'. ""We are glad to see the letter the nuns received from Bishop Agnelo. It shows that there is someone with a heart in the church. There is someone who follows Christ,"" the joint Convenor of SOS Shaiju Antony told NDTV. ""The catholic church is spending millions and holding an important meeting in Rome in February on the clerical sex abuse crisis and child protection, but why leave out abuse against women. We need strong laws within churches to deal with this too."" Dr Kochurani Abraham , a leading woman theologian told NDTV. Bishop Mulakkal is accused of raping a nun on 14 occasions from 2014 to 2016, at the St Francis Mission Home in Kuruvilangad. Father Kuriakose Kattuthara -- their colleague -- was found dead at a church in Hoshiarpur's Dasuya in October last year, months after he deposed against the bishop in the rape case.

He added that through this decision, the government has destroyed the concept of equality in the society. ""The Constitution of India has a golden thread by way of Article 14, which speaks of right to equality. Maharashtra government's decision is an attempt to assault and destroy this Article,"" he said. ""The government cannot divide the nation/society into small fragments. This decision of the state is a prime example of erecting narrow silos that shuts doors for people to have equal opportunities at jobs and education,"" the senior counsel, who was formerly state advocate general, argued.

""Our teams are alert and the deadlock may soon be over after today's meeting with the committee constituted by the government,"" news agency PTI quoted DGP (Law and order) ML Lather. Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla started a dharna yesterday along with his supporters on the railway tracks in Rajasthan's Sawai Madhopur district, demanding reservation for five communities including Gujjars. He said the government had promised five per cent reservation to the community in its election manifesto so the state government was liable to give the same ""so that the people can return home gracefully"". Vijay Bainsla, another Gujjar leader, said they have been waiting for talks with the government since last 20 days on their demand. He said agitators blocked Jaipur-Delhi, Jodhpur-Bhilwara, Ajmer-Bhilwara highway on Saturday. The agitation comes nearly a month after 10 per cent quota for the economically weaker sections in the general category in jobs and education was cleared by parliament. The move was introduced as a constitutional amendment, passed in parliament and enacted in a matter of days. However, the validity of the 10 per cent quota will be examined by the Supreme Court. The government has argued that since the bill provides reservation on basis of income, not caste, it was not subject to the 50 per cent bar. The agitation comes nearly a month after 10 per cent quota for the economically weaker sections in the general category in jobs and education was cleared by parliament. ""We have a good chief minister and a good prime minister. We want that they listen to the demands of Gujjar community. It isn't an uphill task for them to provide reservation,"" an agitating member of the Gujjar community told news agency ANI. The Gujjars say if 10 per cent reservation for the economically backward can be passed, then why not for them. ""We want 5 per cent reservation. The government hasn't responded to my request. So, I am going to start an agitation,"" Mr Bainsla told news agency ANI. The Rajasthan government has formed a three-member committee comprising cabinet ministers Raghu Sharma, Vishvendra Singh and Master Bhanwar Lal to lead talks with the Gujjar community. The Rajasthan government had assured the Gujjar community of 5 per cent reservation in a special category in 2017 after a bout of agitation. It had planned to expand the reservation for Other Backward Classes from 21 per cent to 26 per cent and give 5 per cent reservation to Gujjars and other castes. After the expansion, the total reservation in the state would have crossed the 50 per cent ceiling set by the Supreme Court. The bill to this effect, which was introduced in the monsoon session of the state assembly in 2017, was put on hold by the Rajasthan High Court after an appeal against it. The community has held four agitations for reservations from 2007 up to 2015, where they blocked rail and road traffic. In 2007 and 2008, more than 70 people had died in the clashes during the agitation. In 2010 and 2015 though, only rail and road traffic was disrupted.

Giving impetus to the BJP's Lok Sabha election campaign, PM Modi's visit to the three northeastern states is part of his ten-state visit in just five days. During his visit to Assam, Arunachal and Tripura, Prime Minister Modi is inaugurating several key projects and addressing multiple rallies. The prime minister began his visit to the northeast by laying the foundation of a greenfield airport at Hollongi in Parum Pare district of Arunachal Pradesh. The airport will not only boost the region's connectivity and economic growth, but will also be of strategic importance. PM Modi also launched a project to construct a strategic tunnel in Sela, which will reduce travel time to the India-China border town of Tawang by over an hour. Prime Minister Modi's next stop was Guwahati, in Assam, where he reached around 12:30 pm. His last stop for the day will be in Tripura, where he is scheduled to arrive at around 3:30 pm. In Guwahati, PM Modi laid the foundation of a six-lane bridge over the river Brahmaputra and kicked-off construction work of an All India Institute of Medical Sciences or AIIMS - India's premier hospital and medical research facility - at Changsari, which is approximately 22 kilometers from Guwahati. The prime minister also inaugurated the Numaligarh Refinery's bio-diesel plant and the Barauni-Guwahati gas pipeline - two key energy projects for Assam. These pipelines, connecting northeast with the national gas grid, will not only meet the fuel requirement of industries, but also supply CNG for automobiles and cooking gas to households. MAJOR PUSH FOR DEVELOPMENT In Arunachal Pradesh, the prime minister launched a new, dedicated, round-the-clock Doordarshan channel for the state. The channel has aptly been named 'DD Arun Prabha'. PM Modi also dedicated the 110 MW Pare hydroelectric power plant to the nation. Apart from this, he laid the foundation stone for a permanent campus of the prestigious Film and Television Institute of India at Jote and inaugurated the upgraded Tezu Airport. He also launched several vital schemes and inaugurated 50 health and wellness centers in the state. The total value of projects launched by PM Modi for Arunachal Pradesh alone crossed the Rs 4,000 crore mark, according to news agency Press Trust of India. In Assam, PM Modi laid the foundation stone of Northeast Gas Grid which will lead to uninterrupted supply of natural gas across the northeast. He also inaugurated a gas processing plant in Tinsukia and an LPG capacity augmentation of mounted storage vessel in Guwahati. The prime minister also laid the foundation stone of NRL bio-refinery at Numaligarh, as well as the 729-km long Barauni-Guwahati gas pipeline. In Tripura, PM Modi will dedicate the Garjee-Belonia railway line to the nation by unveiling a plaque. He will also inaugurate the new complex of the Tripura Institute of Technology and unveil the statue of Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur at Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport in Agartala. PROTESTS GREET THE PRIME MINISTER However, PM Modi is also facing resistance by activists in the northeastern states over the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which commits to providing Indian citizenship and full constitutional rights to non-Muslims who came and settled in India after facing persecution in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Though the bill has provisions for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and Christians, it does not include Muslims. This decision by the Centre has led to allegations of religious discrimination from rights activists as well as political parties. Activists show black flags to PM Modi, protesting the Citizenship Amendment Bill, in Guwahati Shortly after landing in Guwahati last night, Prime Minister Modi was greeted with black flags and angry activists protesting the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. Several civil society groups across the northeast - including the All Assam Students Union or AASU - have decided to intensify their ongoing agitation. Slogans of ""Narendra Modi, Go Back"" were heard as activists stood by the roads waving black flags as PM Modi's motorcade was heading to Raj Bhawan from the airport last evening. Agitations have also intensified across Nagaland and Manipur, with several civil society groups as well as regional parties calling for a boycott of the prime minister's tour of the region. The Asom Gana Parishad - the BJP's former alliance partner in Assam - also took out a massive torchlight march against the controversial bill on Friday evening.

Several civil society groups across the Northeast -- including the All Assam Students Union -- have decided to intensify their ongoing agitation in view of PM Modi's visit, which will include public rallies and foundation-laying ceremonies across Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Tripura. The Prime Minister was also shown black flags and greeted with ""Narendra Modi, Go Back"" slogans while he was heading to Raj Bhawan from the airport. Meanwhile, the agitation over the Citizenship Amendment Bill continued in the Northeast, and is expected to intensify when the Prime Minister embarks on a whirlwind tour of the region on Saturday. This would be his first visit to the region ever since massive protests erupted in the region over the controversial legislation that is expected to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha soon. The lower house had passed it amid raging protests early last month. The legislation, which seeks to to provide Indian citizenship to non-Muslims from three neighbouring countries, has evoked allegations of religious discrimination from rights activists as well as political parties. A massive protest was taken out by royal scion Pradyot Manikya Deb Barman in Tripura's Dhalai district earlier this week over three Tripura-based tribal leaders being charged under the sedition law for taking part in an agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Bill. They have been accused of shouting anti-India slogans. Agitations have now intensified across Nagaland and Manipur, with several civil society groups as well as regional parties calling for a boycott of the Prime Minister's tour of the region. Massive protests are expected in the region on Saturday.

Several students had launched protests objecting to the new vice-chancellor's decision to not allow religious festivities in campus saying that it would be against the ""secular culture of the campus"". ""Permission has been denied because ours is a secular campus and as such we cannot permit religious functions,” the letter from university registrar to the principal read. But as protests intensified, the vice-chancellor withdrew his decision. ""Saraswati Puja will be allowed on 10th February and the next day even Visarjan will be allowed. We have to make provisions for the visarjan, to be done in a way, that water pollution can be avoided,” the Principal Dr Sunil Kumar told NDTV. Saraswati Puja, which will be observed on February 10 this year, worships the Hindu goddess of education. This incident happened a year after a college student was suspended for defying the rules of conducting Saraswati Puja. Subsequently, a group of north Indian students also made allegations that they were served beef cutlets at an event in the college, despite the management knowing that most north Indian students did not eat beef. “The event was not conducted by the college. The college was not in the know-how of what would be served. It was organised by the people who were conducting the on-campus programme,” the principal had told then.

The nine Congress MLAs, who had skipped the legislature sitting on Wednesday, were not present in the House today either. A chaotic scene greeted Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar as he entered, with the BJP MLAs in the Well of the House. Before Mr Kumar could take his seat and start the proceedings, the BJP MLAs raised slogans like, ''Go back CM, Go back CM'', ''Step Down CM, Step Down CM'', ''Down down government without majority'' and ''No unity, no majority''. The agitating MLAs did not pay heed to the speaker's request that the BJP members resume their seats, prompting him to adjourn the proceedings for 10 minutes. When the House met again, the BJP continued with its protest, forcing the Speaker to adjourn proceedings till 12:30 pm on Friday when Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy's government will table the 2019-2020 budget. A similar chaos prevailed in the Karnataka Legislative Council where the BJP members trooped into the Well of the House and raised slogans saying the government has lost majority.

The house will reconvene on Friday morning, when Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy is scheduled to present the state budget. The question over the government's majority arises largely because of the absence of several legislators belonging to the Congress - the JDS's coalition partner in the state. Despite being ordered by Congress Legislature Party chief Siddaramaiah to be present in the House, many legislators continue to stay away. These include four Congress MLAs - Ramesh Jarkiholi, Umesh Jadhav, B Nagendra and Mahesh Kumathihalli - who had also absented themselves from the Congress Legislature Party meet called in December. Another legislator, KN Ganesh, is on the run because he is wanted by police for allegedly assaulting fellow-Congressman Anand Singh. As no Congress MLA has resigned from the party so far, the coalition still officially has 118 MLAs in a House with a halfway mark of 113. The Congress leadership insists that all party MLAs will be present for the budget. The JDS also asserted that the budget will be presented on schedule. ""In the May 2018 election, the people of the state gave the BJP 104 seats. We formed a coalition with the Congress because 113 seats are needed. The BJP should play the role of a responsible opposition, but they are instead offering Rs 50 crore and Rs 100 crore to our legislators. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah support this,"" alleged Karnataka Minister GT Deve Gowda. The JDS leader criticised the BJP for disrupting assembly proceedings. ""They did not allow the Governor -- the very Governor appointed by the centre -- to make his address. Operation Kamala has failed, and the entire country is watching what the BJP is doing. The budget will be presented tomorrow and everything will be passed. Why don't they move a no-confidence motion instead of disrupting the proceedings?"" Mr Gowda asked. He was referring to an incident on Wednesday, when BJP legislators trooped into the well of the house and loudly called on Governor Vajubhai Vala to not deliver his address. ""You are made to read lies, so please don't read it,"" a few of them were heard shouting. BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa defended his legislators, and insisted that the government does not have a majority. ""Karnataka has seen little development in the last eight months, and that is why we boycotted the Governor's address yesterday. The question of moving a no-confidence motion does not arise at all,"" the former Chief Minister said. BJP member R Ashok has alleged that superstitious beliefs are behind the ruling coalition's decision to present the budget presentation just after 12.30 pm on Friday. ""The budget has always been presented at 11 or 12 o'clock, never like this. This particular time was fixed by HD Revanna, Mr Kumaraswamy's brother, who always has a lemon (to ward off the evil eye) in his possession,"" he said. Mr Ashok then went on to claim that everything done by the Congress-JDS government is based on superstitious beliefs. ""Where is the money for farm loans - the Rs 40,000 crore farm loan waiver they promised? There is no money. Tomorrow is an astrology budget that's not for the public.

The Union government may also remove the names of the officers from an empanelled list and bar them from serving at the central level for a certain period of time. Sources identified the officers as West Bengal Director General Of Police Virendra, Additional Director General of Police Vineet Kumar Goyal, Additional general of Police (Law and Order) Anuj Sharma, Commissioner of Police (Bidhanagar Commissionerate) Gyanwant Singh, and Additional Commissioner of Police (Kolkata) Supratim Darkaar. Sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs said the police officers -- who are supposed to remain neutral -- had taken a political stand by participating in the protest. Although the Bengal government is not duty-bound to follow the order, this will only serve to further escalate friction between the state and the centre. West Bengal Chief Minister Banerjee had launched a sit-in protest on February 4 against the CBI's attempts to question Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams. She called it off her on Tuesday evening, after the Supreme Court forbade the CBI from taking any coercive action against the police officer, categorically stating that the he was not part of the agitation. Earlier, the centre had reportedly sought action against the Kolkata Police Commissioner for indulging in indisciplined behaviour and violating the All India Services (Conduct) Rules. However, Ms Banerjee claimed  that she received no such request from Delhi. The Kolkata police chief is in the middle of a massive showdown between the CBI and Ms Banerjee, who has vehemently challenged the probe agency's right to turn up at Mr Kumar's door to question him on ""missing evidence"" in the chit fund cases on Sunday evening. The incident ended with several CBI officials being detained by the state police. The central agency told the Supreme Court that Rajeev Kumar's probe in the cases ""shielded guilty companies"" and there was ""inaction, selective action and a nexus"" between the police and the accused companies. The evidence handed over by the team ""is not complete and was doctored"", the CBI added in its affidavit -- listing allegations against the Kolkata police chief.

I demand that the incident should be probed by a judge (of the Patna High Court) immediately,"" Mr Kushwaha told reporters in Patna, his right arm wrapped in plaster . He alleged a First Information Report (FIR) was filed against him and 250 others by the chief minister. ""I am giving a warning to Nitish Kumar. If he does not withdraw his complaint, then by February 9, all of us and 250 unknown people will turn up at Kotwali police station,"" said the RLSP chief, who on February 2 along with his supporters had marched towards the Raj Bhawan in Patna in protest against stagnant educational reforms in Bihar. They were lathi-charged and several of them were injured. He denied that his supporters had turned violent, and alleged that miscreants in civil dress were sent by the administration to spread chaos. ""The chief minister has been misleading the people with the claim that our march had turned violent. The fact is, goons in civil dress were sent by you (Nitish Kumar), your administration, for creating a ruckus so that the police could have a justification for using brute force,"" Mr Kushwaha told reporters, according to news agency PTI. Mr Kushwaha quit the Bihar government and exited the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in December last year in a move anticipated for months because of his growing resentment with the ruling party and its seat-share deal with Nitish Kumar's party, JDU, for the Lok Sabha elections.

The letter said the two nuns, who approached the women's panel, alleged the transfer orders issued last year were to pressurise and threaten them as they were prominent witnesses in the case. ""The complainants also apprehend danger to their lives, if transferred to distant regions,"" the letter said. ""As you are aware of the seriousness of the issue, the National Commission for Women urges your personal intervention into the matter to ensure safety of the complainants, victim (of the case under trial) and the fellow nuns,"" the letter added. The Commission requested the chief minister ""to take prompt action to ensure prevention of sabotage of material evidence and witnesses in pending case against rape-accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal, so that justice may prevail"". The nuns had been asked to report to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation's Jalandhar convent and meet its Superior General Sr Regina Kandamthottu on January 26. Earlier, four nuns were served notices by the superior general of the congregation, Regina Kadamthottu, urging them to take up their assigned responsibilities as befitting members of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation. The four nuns and the rape survivor had written to the Kerala chief minister, seeking his intervention to ensure that their transfer orders were not affected till the trial of the case was over. Bishop Mulakkal, a senior member of the Roman Catholic clergy in India, was arrested last year following allegations by the nun that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted her at the Kuravilangad convent between 2014 and 2016, a charge denied by him.

The farmers will reach Mumbai on February 27, the AIKS said in a statement after its meeting. Farmers -- 40,000 in number as pegged by the AIKS -- had taken out the protest march in March last year between the two cities to press for several demands, including farm loan waiver, minimum support price and provision of water and pension to farmers. The farmers' bodies have been up in arms against the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project as well. The state government had ""woken up"" to and had accepted the farmers'' demands after they took out the march between Nashik and Mumbai, it said. ""A year has passed, but the government has not executed the promises it made. There is dissent among the farmers,"" the AIKS said in the statement. ""Hence, a long march will be taken out again against this betrayal by the Centre and state government,"" it said.

The AIKS claimed that the upcoming march will have twice the number of farmers taking part in it as compared to last year. It said farmers from 23 districts of the state will take part in it. The new long march also follows 208 organisations of farmers from parts of the country staging protest in Delhi in November last year, raising the demands.

The Meghalaya BJP has written to the central leadership to exempt all northeastern states from the purview of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. The Bill has already been passed in the Lok Sabha. While general secretary of Meghalaya BJP Bashailang Khongwir said the party wishes to pass the Bill on humanitarian grounds, he also stated that the issue is sentimental to the people of the state and the region as a whole. He added that the Bill for a multi-cultural country like India validates the phrase, ""One man's food is another man's poison"". Last month, the BJP in Mizoram had requested the centre to not go ahead with the Bill after its passage in Lok Sabha on January 8. ""The impulse of the Bill is contrary to the people of northeast India. It is a sentimental issue in Northeast and misconception about the bill has reached such a point where no ground of justification can bring reconciliation over the Bill,"" the letter said.

Meanwhile, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has assured that he would discuss the Bill with other political parties and civil society groups in the northeast. The Citizenship Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to grant Indian citizenship to the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who fled religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and entered India before December 31, 2014, after six years of residence in the country, instead of the current 12 years, even if they do not have any proper documents.

Mamata Banerjee Turns Street Fighter For Cop She Once Refused To Trust,Mamata Banerjee Turns Street Fighter For Cop She Once Refused To Trust,https://www.ndtv.com/people/kolkata-police-commissioner-rajeev-kumar-profile-mamata-banerjee-turns-street-fighter-for-cop-she-on-1988791,en,"During her days in the opposition, Mamata Banerjee had accused an IPS officer of tapping the phones of political rivals of the ruling Left Front. A decade down the line, she is staging a dharna to protest the CBI's bid to question him. Meet Rajeev Kumar, the Kolkata police commissioner, known for his impeccable investigating and electronic surveillance skills, who was once a blue eyed boy of former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya. Ms Banerjee had then accused Mr Kumar of snooping on telephonic conversations of opposition leaders, an allegation rejected by the then Left Front government. An IPS officer of the 1989 batch, 53-year-old Mr Kumar, who holds an engineering degree in computer science from IIT Roorkee, is a native of Uttar Pradesh. During his impressive career, Mr Kumar has held important positions including those of Joint Commissioner (Special Task Force) and Director General (CID). It was under him that the STF of Kolkata Police became a byword for terror for several top Maoists leaders and notorious criminals. He was instrumental in the arrest of Chattaradhar Mahato, the much-feared convenor of People's Committee Against Police Atrocities, a frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist), at the height of Lalgarh movement. Kumar''s officers disguised as journalist had arrested Mahato. The tribals of Lalgarh, backed by Maoists, had begun a movement in the region against alleged police atrocities over a decade-and-half ago. They had targeted the then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee''s convoy at Salboni in Paschim Medinipur, prompting the government to launch a massive crackdown to flush out the rebels. Former Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar, in his book ''Dial D for Don'', reminisced how Rajeev Kumar, then SSP (CID), did extensive work after the American Center attack in 2001 and the high-profile kidnapping case of Khadim shoe company's CEO Partha Pratim Roy Burman. The former Delhi police boss was full of praise for Mr Kumar. Former IPS officers say Mr Kumar always stood by his subordinates. ""He always stood by his men and officers. He is a team leader in the true sense,"" a former IPS officer said, adding he enjoys ""immense respect"" among the rank and file of the Kolkata police force. In 2011, when Mamata Banerjee''s Trinamool Congress came to power ending the 34-year Left Front rule, she wanted Mr Kumar to be shunted to some insignificant position. She was, however, dissuaded by senior police officers from taking such a course. Over the next eight years a lot of water has flown down the Howrah bridge. In January 2012, when Bidhannagar Police Commissionarate was formed, Rajeev Kumar was appointed its first commissioner. When the Saradha chit fund scam was busted in 2013, thousands of collection agents for the company converged at the TMC headquarters and demanded action against its chairman Sudipta Sen. The first cases against the group were lodged under the jurisdiction of Bidhannagar police commissionerate. Mr Kumar and his team arrested Mr Sen and his partner in crime Debjani Mukherjee from Jammu and Kashmir on April 18, 2013. The state government formed a special investigation team (SIT) under him to probe the fraud which saw lakhs of depositors getting duped of their hard earned money with the promise of abnormally high returns. It was during his stint as SIT chief that he grew closer to the ruling dispensation. His proximity to the establishment also brought with it criticism, as opposition parties accused the SIT of trying to destroy evidences against ruling TMC leaders and stalling the probe. In November 2013, rebel TMC MP Kunal Ghosh was arrested by the SIT. A CBI probe into the chit fund scam was ordered by the Supreme Court in May 2014 on a petition by senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan. Meanwhile, the TMC dispensation elevated him as Additional Director General of CID. During his tenure as ADG (CID) he outsmarted the CBI and arrested the first accused in the case of rape of a 70-year-old nun. The nun was raped by a gang of seven dacoits inside a Convent in Nadia district on March 14, 2015. Amid growing outrage, the state government had decided to hand over the case to the CBI on March 18, 2015. But before the federal probe agency could lay its hands on the perpetrators, Mr Kumar arrested the first accused on March 26. He took over as 21st police commissioner of Kolkata on February 2016, the year the state had its last assembly polls. A month later, two officers of Kolkata police, disguised as cow smugglers, tried to bribe BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha to help them in their trade. The incident happened just a fortnight after Narada news released sting videos showing Trinamool Congress leaders purportedly accepting money from a fictitious company. In April that year, the Election Commission decided to replace Kumar with Somen Mitra. Once back in power, Mamata Banerjee reinstated Mr Kumar. Last September, a series of audio clips of purported telephone conversations between Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP general secretary in charge of West Bengal, and Mukul Roy, a former confidante of Ms Banerjee and now a frontline leader of the BJP, started doing the rounds in social media. The clips included a conversation where Mr Roy purportedly asked Mr Vijayvargiya to talk to BJP president Amit Shah and get the CBI to keep a ""watch"" on four IPS officers serving in the state so as to ""scare"" them. Mr Roy had then alleged that their phones were tapped by Kolkata police, which rejected the allegations.

The Belgian woman described her harrowing experience in a letter to the Belgian Embassy, which in turn wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs. Reports outline the harrowing sequence of events the Belgain national had to face in less than 24 hours that she spent in the country. The first of the men she was reportedly cheated by was an autorickshaw driver that she hired from the New Delhi Railway Station. The driver took her to his aides, who posed as policemen and told the woman her destination was inaccessible due to an ongoing violent protest. She was also shown videos of the said protest and was made to believe it was live. She was asked to leave New Delhi and also lose her jewellery. The men also reportedly conned her into believing her hotel room booking was cancelled. The men tried to sell several expensive hotel rooms to her, before she settled for one and paid $40 in cash. She was taken to a room with no windows, where she locked herself up, reports The Hindu. It was only after her SIM card was activated and she was able to contact a friend in Rishikesh that she learnt the men have been duping her. A hotel staffer then came to her rescue and the woman took the next flight back to Belgium the next day, The Hindu reported. The Delhi Police which has now arrested a 30-year-old travel agent. ""He is being interrogated to identify and find out the whereabouts of two others who brought the Belgian national to his shop in an autorickshaw,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Madhur Verma said. He, along with his brother, interacted with the Belgian national and cheated her by selling a cheap hotel package and made her believe that her original booking was cancelled because of protests near the hotel, the officer said. New Delhi is notorious for crimes against women and has earned itself a reputation for being unsafe for female travellers.

A case had been pending against Mr Thulasi for his 'shocking' statement in October last that young women entering sabarimala should be ripped apart and one half should be sent to Delhi and the other to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan's office. He had also attacked the bench which had delivered the judgement. The actor, who is popular in negative roles in films and television serials, had made the offensive remarks while speaking at a meeting convened to welcome the BJP state president, P S Sreedharan Pillai led ""sabarimala samrakshana yatra"" on October 12 last year at chavara.

The Kerala High court had on January 10 dismissed his anticipatory bail petition after directing him to surrender before the investigation officer. Police sources said he surrendered this morning and his arrest had been recorded. The actor would be produced before a magistrate court soon. The actor was booked under various sections of IPC for deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage the modesty of women, Punishment for criminal intimidation, word, gesture or act to insult the modesty of women and wantonly provocating to cause riot and sexual harassment.

However, the Trinamool Congress chief received unlikely support from BJP ally Shiv Sena who attacked the Modi government over the face-off. Alleging that it was ""orchestrated"" for political gains in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena in its editorial party mouthpiece ""Saamana"" said what was happening in Kolkata was a ""threat to democracy"". Claiming that the BJP will fall short of 100 seats in north and west India, the Sena claimed BJP orchestrated this to ""lay hopes on states like Bengal to win 10 to 15 seats."" Early last year, Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had declared that his party will fight all future elections on its own. However, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said he was ""certain"" of a pre-poll alliance with the Shiv Sena. ""We do have our differences with Mamata Banerjee and her party, but she is, indeed, hitting back at the Centre with equal force,"" the Sena remarked. The Sena said the centre could have acted against the Kolkata Police chief two months back and the CBI should have carried proper summons before visiting his house to question him. It also said Narendra Modi should look in to the crisis in Bengal as a prime minister of the country and not as a leader of the BJP. The Shiv Sena is a constituent of the BJP-led ruling coalitions in Maharashtra and also at the Centre, but it routinely criticises its alliance partner's leaders and government policies. Mamata Banerjee's sit-in protest entered its third day today amid the Supreme Court listing the matter for next hearing on February 20. The court also directed that Rajeev Kumar, the police chief cannot be arrested and will be questioned in the Rose Valley and Saradha cases in Shillong.

Responding sharply to Ms Banerjee's massive protest and the outpour of support from other opposition parties, Mr. Jaitley, in a blog, attacked the opposition, calling it ""a Kleptocrat's Club"". ""Mamata Banerjee's disproportionate over-reaction to the CBI wanting to interrogate the Kolkata Police Chief has flagged several issues for a public discourse. The most important being that a Kleptocrat's Club now aspires to capture the reigns of India,"" Mr Jaitley wrote. Opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi, N Chandrababu Naidu, Arvind Kejriwal and Akhilesh Yadav pledged their support to the Trinamool Congress chief. Tejashwi Yadav and the DMK's Kanimozhi met Ms Banerjee at the protest site in Kolkata on Monday. Mr. Jaitley, who is in New York for treatment, said Mamata Banerjee is staging the dharna to ""project herself as the nucleus of India's opposition."" Mamata Banerjee's disproportionate over-reaction to the CBI wanting to interrogate the Kolkata Police Chief has flagged several issues for a public discourse. The most important being that a Kleptocrat's Club now aspires to capture the reigns of India. Mamata Banerjee began her protest against the centre on Sunday evening after a showdown between Kolkata Police and officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) over investigations into two chit fund scams in Bengal. A CBI team that wanted to question Kolkata police chief Rajeev Kumar was taken to a police station and detained for hours before they were released. Ms Banerjee declared her agitation to ""save the constitution"" and said she was ready to face the consequences. She accused the centre of sending CBI officers after ""one of the best officers in the world"". Mamata Banerjee has been sitting on a protest in Kolkata since Sunday. Arun Jaitley said that the chit fund scams were unearthed in 2012-13 and its investigations were handed over to the CBI by the Supreme Court. ""If a Police Officer is also required to be interrogated, how does it become a 'super emergency', ""assault on Federalism"", or 'destruction of Institutions'?"" he said. 2019 Election will be either Modi Vs. Chaos or Modi Vs. Anarchy. Mamata Banerjee's latest acrobatics are the best evidence of the kind of governance India's opposition can provide. The centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that Rajeev Kumar is a ""potential accused"" in the investigation into Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams and asked the court to order him to surrender all evidence, fearing that he may try to destroy electronic evidence. The Supreme Court will take up the petition today. Mr Jaitley justified the CBI's action, saying the constitutional framework clearly defines the sharing of functions between the centre and the state and that it does not permit an overlap.

As concerns over Anna Hazare's health grew, the Shiv Sena and MNS sought the BJP-led government's intervention to save the 81-year-old activist's life. Anna Hazare began his fast on January 30 at his native Ralegan Siddhi village in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, demanding appointment of anti-corruption watchdogs at the centre and in Maharashtra and resolution of farmers' issues. ""Anna now weighs 71.1 kg and has lost 4.25 kg weight since his fast began. His blood pressure is also increasing due to fasting,"" Dr Dhananjay Pote, a doctor attending to him, told PTI today. Dr Pote has been asked by the villagers to keep a tab on Anna Hazare's health and prepare a daily report. Several people, including government officials, have met Anna Hazare in the last six days and requested him to end his fast. MNS chief Raj Thackeray and water conservationist Rajendra Singh met Anna Hazare today and extended their support to his agitation. Raj Thackeray asked him not to sacrifice his life for the ""useless"" government. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, whose party is an ally of the BJP at the centre and in Maharashtra, had on Sunday extended his support to the activist, asking him to emulate socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan and lead an agitation against corruption. The Sena, in an editorial in party mouthpiece ""Saamana"" today, appealed to the BJP-led government to save his life. Anna Hazare had earlier warned that if the Modi government did not fulfil its promises, he would return his Padma Bhushan award. The activist has been demanding appointment of Lokpal at the centre and Lokayuktas in states where such statutory anti-corruption watchdogs do not exist, and resolution of farmers' issues. He has also been demanding implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations on ways to address agrarian distress, besides electoral reforms. Raj Thackeray asked Anna Hazare to end his protest and conduct a joint tour of the state with him to ""bury"" the BJP- led government. The MNS leader and Anna Hazare held a closed door meeting at a room in the Yadavbaba temple premises for around 20 minutes. After the meeting, Mr Thackeray addressed the gathering at Anna Hazare's protest site and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ""cheating"" the nation and not following his party's own poll manifesto. He quoted some tweets and speeches of PM Modi during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections campaign in which, Mr Thackeray said, the prime minister had praised Anna Hazare for his honesty and moral attitude. ""I have appealed Anna not to sacrifice his life for these useless people. I have also asked him not to trust Prime Minister Narendra Modi and any of his promises,"" he said. Mr Thackeray said on December 18, 2013 PM Modi had tweeted in favour of the Lokpal Bill. ""Now, almost five years of the Modi government is completed but no action has been taken so far. Today, the people in power are there because of Anna's agitation in 2013. They should not forget it,"" he said. Mr Thackeray said he was surprised that even Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was part of Anna Hazare's agitation some years ago and came into national limelight from there, had not visited the activist or enquired about his health. ""The entire country got to know Kejriwal because of Anna's agitation. Now, he (Kejriwal) is in power and not showing concern towards Anna's health,"" he said. The MNS leader said he had told Anna Hazare that they are ""dishonest"" people. ""You should quit the fast and we will jointly tour the state and bury this government. My party is extending support to Anna's cause,"" Mr Thackeray said. Rajendra Singh met Anna Hazare this morning and expressed concern over the activist's health. Mr Singh along with some social activists discussed the issues plaguing the farmers and ""flaws"" in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act-2013. He extended his support to Anna Hazare and his agitation and said some NGOs would also be joining his protest in a day or two, as everybody has realised the ""insensitivity and cruelty"" of the Modi government.

The police officer at the centre of the controversy - Rajeev Kumar - should not have sat on protest along with the Chief Minister, he said. The BJP has ripped into the Chief Minister since she sided with the Kolkata police chief, describing him as ""among the best in the world"" and holding an indefinite dharna to take on the Centre. Various BJP leaders -- including Union Ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani -- have questioned why Ms Banerjee is going out on a limb for a police officer. ""Circumstances indicate that this cop knows a lot and therefore has to be saved,"" Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Mr Roy had been one of the leaders questioned in the Saradha Ponzi scheme that gypped lakhs of small investors of their savings, over which at least four lawmakers, including ministers, have been arrested. Four years ago, he was also questioned by the CBI for what is referred to as the ""Narada scam"" after the website that conducted the alleged expose on a group of Trinamool leaders. Twelve leaders were accused of accepting cash in a sting by a journalist posing as a businessman and seeking favours from Trinamool. ""I am not guilty. I was interrogated when I was in the TMC. Investigation should go on and guilty should be punished,"" Mr Roy told NDTV. There were apprehensions when Mr Roy quit the party in September 2017, peeved over the ascendancy Ms Banerjee was giving to her nephew Abhishek Banerjee. In the months leading to his parting ways with the Trinamool, Mr Roy had been removed as the party's in-charge of Tripura. The party was seen as steadily making gains in the Left-dominated state till all its six legislators in the state switched to the BJP in August. He was last put in charge of Punjab. Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee had said, ""Under pressure from central agencies, for his own self-interest, Mukul Roy was trying to hurt the party from within"". There was suspicion that the leader was being provided immunity from investigation by the BJP in exchange for information that could compromise his party colleagues.

As soon as she sat on dharna to ""save the constitution"" along with the Kolkata police commissioner and others, opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, either phoned the Trinamool chief or tweeted to extend their support in her fight against the centre. However, the BJP pointed out that Rahul Gandhi used to have a different stand on the issue. The party's official Twitter handle posted a collage of tweets by the Congress between 2014 and 2016. The tweets were critical of Mamata Banerjee as well as the West Bengal government over the chit fund scam. One of the tweets spoke about the ""Syndicate Raj"" in the state, while another called the Saradha scam as the one of the biggest scams in the country. The West Bengal Congress had also tweeted what appeared like a statement of Rahul Gandhi from 2016, which said ""Mamata ji didn't even utter a word on it (the Saradha scam)"". ""Diagnosed: Multiple Personality Disorder is characterized by atleast two distinct and enduring personality states - there is trouble remembering certain events, beyond ordinary forgetfulness. These states alternately show in person's behavior. Get well soon, Rahul ji,"" the BJP's tweet read. Rajeev Kumar had headed a special probe into the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams in which thousands of small investors were cheated of their money. The CBI says that he had ignored multiple summons over the past two years and that the agency wanted to ask him about missing evidence. The CBI told the Supreme Court today that the Kolkata police wasn't cooperating. The agency's interim chief, M Nageswara Rao, also accused Rajeev Kumar of destroying evidence in the chit fund cases. CHANGE OF HEART? Mamata Banerjee had hosted a grand rally of over 20 opposition parties last month where top leaders had urged non-BJP parties to set aside their differences to form a united opposition that can fight the BJP in the upcoming national election. While Rahul Gandhi had skipped the mega meet, he wrote a letter to Mamata Banerjee and sent Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Mallikarjun Kharge to represent the party. In Uttar Pradesh, arch rivals-turned-friends Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party have sutured an alliance with a common objective - to defeat the BJP. Rahul Gandhi's tweet from Sunday night where he assured Ms Banerjee that ""the entire opposition will stand together and defeat these fascist forces "", many say, appears to be headed in that direction, for the ""future of the country"" as the proposed mahagathbandhan puts it. I spoke with Mamata Di tonight and told her we stand shoulder to shoulder with her. The happenings in Bengal are a part of the unrelenting attack on India's institutions by Mr Modi & the BJP. The entire opposition will stand together & defeat these fascist forces. While there has been no formal alliance between Ms Banerjee and the Congress, Dinesh Trivedi, a former union minister and a close aide to Ms Banerjee, said she enjoys a good rapport with Sonia Gandhi, a former Congress president, and so working with her two children would not be a problem for her, reported news agency Reuters.

Standing on a stage adjacent to where she has been on a sit-in protest for most part of the day, the chief minister greeted the officers and handed over the awards - all amid an intense court fight and a bitter war of words with the centre over allegations that Kolkata police chief Rajeev Kumar may destroy evidence linked to the Rose Valley and Saradha chit fund scams, which he had been investigating. The scene at the award function did not have anything to suggest it was out of the ordinary despite the circumstances surrounding the event . ""The highest levels of the BJP leadership are doing the worst kind of political vendetta. Not only are political parties their targets, they are misusing power to take control of the police and destroy all institutions. We condemn this,"" Ms Banerjee tweeted on Sunday. With senior police officers flanking her, Ms Banerjee in a white saree stood sharp as police officers, including those with the traffic department, in their crisp uniform marched a few steps, saluted the chief minister and took the recognition for excellent performance from her. Ms Banerjee has put her weight behind the Kolkata police chief after CBI officers came knocking at his door on Sunday night. A major drama unfolded as the CBI officers were instead packed up to a police station, to be released later. The centre today told the Supreme Court that the Kolkata police commissioner has never responded despite summons for questioning for the last two years as the investigators suspect he may destroy evidence in the scams , in which several members of Ms Banerjee's Trinamool Congress are suspects. ""The Kolkata Police Commissioner is among the best in the world. His integrity, bravery and honesty are unquestioned. He is working 24x7, and was on leave for only one day recently. When you spread lies, the lies will always remain lies,"" Ms Banerjee said on Sunday. The BJP is demanding President's Rule in the state.

A member of Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress retaliated by comparing her to ""Jhansi Ki Rani "", the fearless queen who fought the British forces. A team of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers who arrived at Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar's home to question him, were blocked by the city police and detained briefly before being released. The CBI says Mr Kumar, who had headed a Special Investigation Team into the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams, had ignored its summons over two years.

""There are some extraordinary circumstances. The CBI Joint Director was held hostage at CBI office yesterday. We apprehend that electronic evidence might be destroyed,"" the centre's lawyer Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India, told the Supreme Court a morning after Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee launched her protest over CBI officers trying to question her police chief. The government asked the court to order Rajeev Kumar to surrender all the evidence he had, expressing the worry that he may try to destroy electronic evidence. Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said there is ""no evidence that Kolkata police is destroying evidence"" and added: ""Lay down evidence and if the police commissioner is even remotely trying to destroy evidence, we will come down so heavily on him that he will regret it"". The Supreme Court will take up the petition tomorrow. Appearing for West Bengal government, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi told the Supreme Court that it is witch hunt by the CBI as the Kolkata police chief is a witness and not an accused in the case. But, the bench told him to keep ready the defences of state government ready tomorrow, when it will hear the case. Around 40 CBI officers arrived at the Kolkata police commissioner's home last evening, alleged the state's ruling Trinamool Congress, adding that they tried to question him without a warrant. Rajeev Kumar investigated the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund cases in which several members of Mamata Banerjee's party have been charged or arrested.

The Kolkata police refused to let the CBI officers enter and temporarily detained them at a police station. Rajeev Kumar - who headed the Special Investigation Team probing the Saradha and Rose Valley Ponzi scams that surfaced in 2013 - was asked to help with the investigation after several key documents allegedly went missing. Mamata Banerjee held a press meet in the evening at Rajeev Kumar's home and alleged a ""complete constitutional breakdown"".

The 64-year-old has returned to the same spot where she held the protest that enabled her campaign to end the 34-year Left rule in Bengal. As she paced furiously on the stage built at Metro Channel in the colours of the flag, wearing her trademark white sari and a light shawl, reporters and others saw a glimmer of Mamata Banerjee the consummate street protester . It had been building up for days. As the country heads to the national election, the turf war in Bengal has intensified with the BJP seen to be making inroads in the state. The CBI's attempt to question police chief Rajeev Kumar - described by Mamata Banerjee as one of the world's best officers - last evening in two Ponzi scams provided the trigger. Around 8.30 pm on Sunday, a tent had been put up and the stage set for Mamata Banerjee's ""indefinite satyagraha"" . Many opposition leaders have come out in support of the protest and if it gains momentum, Mamata Banerjee's CV for the country's top post might look a little more appealing. Mamata Banerjee was seen in her trademark white sari and a light shawl on the stage. Facing an aggressive campaign by the BJP and its president Amit Shah to win over Bengal, the Trinamool hopes to mobilise enough support for its ""satyagraha"" to survive the turf war. Mamata Banerjee spent the night sporadically addressing the crowds, consulting with party leaders and avoiding any food. Early this morning, she took a break and returned shortly afterwards, all traces of fatigue gone, ready for day 2 of a protest that could stretch to days . But the Trinamool leader's supporters said she is a veteran at long-haul protests. ""She has the stamina and she knows how to pace herself,"" said a leader, watching her pacing furiously on the stage for the day's ""morning walk"".

Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of Bengal, has received the support of these many leaders, tweeted her top aide Derek O' Brien this morning along with a list that featured Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Arvind Kejriwal and Tejashwi Yadav. Ahead of the national election, Mamata Banerjee's "" satyagraha "" against the centre has added one more layer to the BJP vs opposition battle. ""All of us together,"" posted the Trinamool Congress leader , thanking all the leaders.

However, many in the BJP pointed at the innate contradictions in the show of unity and scoffed at suggestions that this could be a rallying point for the opposition ahead of the general election. Hours after Congress president Rahul Gandhi said he stood ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" with Mamata Banerjee in her fight against the central government for sending CBI officers to question her police chief Rajeev Kumar, his party's top leader in Bengal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, voiced the opposite. ""This is a scam in which many people were duped and the investigation is being done after the Supreme Court order. After Bengal government's order the police stopped CBI. I have not seen such thing. So there is a constitutional crisis in Bengal and the central government must come forward to stop this constitutional crisis,' said Mr Chowdhury, a Congress lawmaker and former state Congress chief. Not long ago, Mr Chowdhury's party president shared his views. In 2016, while campaigning for the Bengal elections, Rahul Gandhi had targeted Mamata Banerjee over the very cases at the heart of her clash with the centre. ""Mamata ji had promised to wipe out corruption in the state. But when corruption took place in front of her, she took no action,"" said Rahul Gandhi, then Congress number two, referring to the Saradha scam. Similarly, the Congress is not in the Akhilesh Yadav-Mayawati club in Uttar Pradesh, even though they all have pledged their support to Mamata Banerjee. Mamata Banerjee sat on protest after the showdown with CBI officials. The Left, caught between its role as an opposition bloc and its intrinsic conflict with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, attacked both the BJP and the West Bengal Chief Minister. ""This drama in Kolkata by the BJP and TMC (Trinamool) is not a fight for any principle but only to save their corrupt and hide their corruption. CPI(M) has fought both these undemocratic, corrupt, communal and dictatorial regimes in the centre and the state and will continue to do so,"" tweeted CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury. Most of the opposition parties who have come out in Mamata Banerjee's support were seen at her unity show in Kolkata a few weeks ago. Two prominent players who did not attend that mega opposition meet, Odisha Chief Minister Navin Patnaik and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, have remained silent in the current controversy. Those close to them say they look at it as a local issue and prefer to stay equidistant from the BJP and the Congress.

The senior BJP leader also pointed out that it was not his party but Rahul Gandhi's Congress that had filed a petition in the Supreme Court asking for an investigation into the chit fund scams.

Last year, Ms Banerjee had extended support to Arvind Kejriwal and had visited him when he was protesting at the home of Delhi Lieutenant Governor.

Madhya Pradesh's former police chief will lead the country's top investigating agency, it was decided on Saturday despite protests by one of the members of the selection committee led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, the opposition member of the collegium, objected to 1983-batch officer Rishi Kumar Shukla' s appointment to the top post citing the officer's lack of experience in anti-corruption investigations. Mr Kharge even sent a two-page dissent note to the Prime Minister to register his resistance. A day after Union minister Arun Jaitley, who is in the US on a medical trip, dissected what he described as ""the Kharge dissent"" in a blog post. The minister ripped through the Congress leader for dissenting too often. ""Shri Kharge dissents regularly. He dissented when Shri Alok Verma was appointed, dissented when Shri Alok Verma was transferred and has now dissented when Shri RK Shukla has been appointed,"" Mr Jaitley wrote. In 2017, Mr Kharge, who was part of the three-member selection committee apart from the Prime Minister and Chief Justice, had written a three-page-long note to the government, marking his dissent to Alok Verma's appointment. The Congress leader had said that Mr Verma had no experience in anti-corruption operations and the government had overlooked the senior-most and a more competent officer Rupak Kumar Dutta. Dissents are a powerful instrument in democracy as the dissenter offers an alternative view point, Mr Jaitley pointed out and agreed to Mr Kharge's right to dissent. However, the right to dissent is sacrosanct and has to be sparingly used, he added. ""A dissent should never be a political tool,"" Mr Jaitley warned. The union minister said that Mr Kharge has been dissenting on ""every conceivable opportunity"" and it has established a pattern of his frame of mind. ""He uses the weapon of dissent excessively and not objectively. Using the instrument of dissent recklessly neutralizes its value,"" Mr Jaitley emphasised. Mallikarjun Kharge was also accused of being prejudiced and making the whole selection process (of the CBI chief) look like a ""political battle"" in Arun Jaitley's 950-odd words Facebook post. The minister also questioned why the Congress leader continued to be part of the committee that transferred Alok Verma when he was in support of the CBI officer. ""Mr Kharge's dissent in the matter of the transfer of Alok Verma was coloured by his political views. He was a petitioner in the Supreme Court himself in support of Alok Verma. He should have recused himself from the Committee since his views were known. He suffered from a bias and conflict of interest. Yet he did not recuse himself. The only task before the Committee was whether the CVC report contains the adequate material for transfer of the Director or not. He wanted the Committee to either ignore the CVC report or sit in appeal against the finding of the CVC - something which was beyond the jurisdiction of the Committee,"" the post explained. Former CBI chief Alok Verma, who was engaged in a bitter fight with his deputy Rakesh Asthana over corruption allegations, was in January removed as boss of the high-profile investigating agency by a panel led by PM Modi, just two days after the Supreme Court had reinstated him in the post. He was transferred to the Fire Services as Director General, after the panel said that as CBI chief, he had ""not acted with the integrity expected of him"". Mr Kharge had put up a dissent note saying that the Central Vigilance Commission inquiry had not found evidence that Mr Verma was guilty of bribery.

In his dissent note, the Leader of Opposition had argued that the officer lacked ""experience in anti-corruption cases"". Former Madhya Pradesh Director General of Police Rishi Kumar Shukla , a 1983-batch officer, has been appointed the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation. His name was chosen from a shortlist of over 30 contenders for the top post by a committee that comprised of Mr Kharge, PM Modi and Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi. Mr Kharge also alleged in his dissent note that committee had violated the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act (DSPE) that governs the CBI by including officers who didn't have experience in anti-corruption cases. ""By including officers who do not have experience in investigating anti-corruption cases, committee is in violation of DSPE Act and Supreme Court judgements guiding CBI Director's appointment,"" he said in the note. ""Seniority cannot be only criterion in appointment to such a critical post and experience in anti-corruption cases and prior experience of having served in the organisation should also be considered,"" he added. The selection committee had met a few times to finalise the candidate for the post of CBI Director. The vital post had been vacant following an unceremonious exit of previous CBI chief Alok Verma, who was removed last month by the committee led by PM Modi. Mr Verma was transferred to the Fire Services as Director General, after the panel said that as CBI chief, he had ""not acted with the integrity expected of him"". Mr Kharge had dissented on the decision of the panel, saying the vigilance inquiry had not found evidence that Mr Verma was guilty of bribery. Mr Verma and his deputy Rakesh Asthana had a public spat last year in which they levelled allegations of corruption against each other. The government in October effected a midnight coup of sorts when it stripped Mr Verma of his powers and installed M Nageswar Rao as the interim chief. The Supreme Court last month reinstated Mr Verma, but he was removed within days. The new CBI chief Rishi Kumar Shukla, 58, is at present the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation. Although Mr Shukla has never been part of the CBI, he had served in the Intelligence Bureau where he handled several sensitive cases. He is said to be close to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. Meanwhile, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said it was Mr Kharge who tried to manipulate the criteria.

The 82-year-old made the announcement in Imphal. The filmmaker has made 14 feature and 31 non-feature films. Protests have rocked the entire northeast against the proposal to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from neighbouring Muslim-majority countries. Critics have called the proposal blatantly anti-Muslim and an attempt by the BJP to boost its Hindu voter base ahead of a general election due by May. Last month, in a major embarrassment for the BJP-led government in Assam, family members of the people who lost their lives during the anti-illegal immigrant movement in the eighties - who were given an award by the Sarbananda Sonowal government in 2016 - decided to return the awards. 125 such families took out a rally in Guwahati to return the awards as a mark of their protest against the bill, which the victim families see as an insult to the memories of the 855 people who lost their lives during the Assam agitation. The bill, which seeks to give citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, has been passed by the Lok Sabha. The bill will be tabled for approval in the Rajya Sabha in the next session, where it is expected to face resistance from the opposition Congress party. The BJP does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. While people have hit the streets to protest against facilitating the entry of outsiders, social groups allege discrimination against immigrants on religious grounds. At least four chief ministers from the Northeast have raised their concerns on the bill until now. Recently, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma and Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga visited the national capital in a combined effort to make the centre scrap the controversial legislation in the face of raging protests across the region. Meanwhile, the joint platform protesting the Citizenship Bill in Manipur - the Manipur People Against Citizenship Amendment Bill (MPACAB) -- has called for a total boycott of use of Hindi language, ban on playing the National Anthem and visits of the Prime Minister and the Home minister until the Bill is withdrawn. They have also given a call for intensifying the protests. Get the latest election news , live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

And it is prepared to meet any eventuality arising out of the bill's introduction in the Rajya Sabha. ""The government understands that people have the democratic right to protest in order to convey their ideas, but certain actions -- such as stripping -- should not be done in a mature society. They should not resort to violence either,"" said Assam Chief Secretary Alok Kumar. He was referring to a recent incident where three men staged a nude protest against the controversial legislation outside the Assam Secretariat in Dispur. While one of them was completely naked, the others had stripped down to their undergarments. They were immediately taken into police custody. Mr Kumar held that it was important to keep the peace, especially with the general elections just a few months away. ""The situation is definitely challenging in our assessment, but we have kept it under control,"" he said. He refused to comment on Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's recent remark that the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill are orchestrated by terror group ULFA , saying that police are still investigating if there's any such angle to the case. The Chief Secretary was addressing a joint press conference with Assam Police Director General Kuladhar Saikia. The bill, passed in the Lok Sabha on January 8, seeks to amend the Citizenship Act-1955 for granting expedited Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from three neighbouring countries. While people hit the streets to protest against facilitating the entry of outsiders, social groups alleged discrimination against immigrants on religious grounds. At least four chief ministers from the Northeast have raised their concerns on the bill until now. Recently, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma and Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga visited the national capital in a combined effort to make the centre scrap the controversial legislation in the face of raging protests across the region. The Assam Police has registered eight cases related to violence and wrongful restraint against protesters, and 15 have been arrested so far.

Women Farmers Tie Up Hands In Symbolic Protest Near Delhi-Noida Flyway,Women Farmers Tie Up Hands In Symbolic Protest Near Delhi-Noida Flyway,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/women-farmers-tie-up-hands-in-symbolic-protest-near-delhi-noida-flyway-1987374,en,"In a symbolic protest near the Delhi-Noida Flyway, women farmers tied their hands up to express helplessness, during a farmers rally in Delhi. Over 1,500 farmers from Uttar Pradesh staged a protest near the Delhi-Noida flyway on Saturday, demanding an increased compensation for land acquired before 2013. The crucial route connecting UP and Delhi was briefly shut on Friday evening. The rally organised by Kisan Uday Abhiyan , included farmers from Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Aligarh and Meerut. ""We are here to demand compensation in accordance with the law on land acquisition that was passed in Parliament in 2013. Our lands were acquired prior to that and we have been left out from the benefits given out under the new law,"" Kaale Singh, a farmer told news agency PTI. He said the farmers want local authorities and administration to take up the matter with UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. ""Yesterday we tried to go to Delhi but were stopped midway, so we decided to stay put near the DND. We won't budge unless we get a satisfactory response from top officials,"" he said. Gautam Buddh Nagar District Magistrate BN Singh met the farmers on Saturday and assured them that he would discuss the matter with the state government. In 2011, two policemen and farmers were killed in clashes following protests over acquisition of land in Greater Noida's Bhatta Parsaul, a Jat-dominated village. Two years since that upheaval the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (also Land Acquisition Act, 2013) was passed. The new law was aimed at providing ""fair compensation"" to those whose land is taken away, brings transparency to the process of acquisition of land to set up factories or buildings, infrastructure projects and assures rehabilitation of those affected.

Former Madhya Pradesh Police Chief Rishi Kumar Shukla Is New CBI Boss,Former Madhya Pradesh Police Chief Rishi Kumar Shukla Is New CBI Boss,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ips-rishi-kumar-shukla-appointed-new-cbi-director-1987358,en,"Former Madhya Pradesh Director General of Police Rishi Kumar Shukla, a 1983-batch officer, has been appointed the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, said a government notification. His name was chosen from a shortlist of over 30 contenders for the top post by a committee led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr Shukla will head the CBI for a period of two years, the notification added. The 58-year-old officer from Gwalior is at present the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation. Although Mr Shukla has never been part of the CBI, he had served in the Intelligence Bureau where he handled several sensitive cases. He is said to be close to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. His appointment was made a day after the second meeting of a high-powered committee comprising PM Modi, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and opposition leader Mallikarjun Kharge. But it took several calls and a lot of convincing from the Prime Minister along with the Chief Justice for protesting Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge to agree to RK Shukla 's name, sources said. Mr Kharge in his two-page dissent note to PM Modi had expressed his objection citing the officer's lack of experience in anti-corruption investigations. He said all three aspects -- seniority, integrity and investigative experience in investigation of anti-corruption cases -- should be given equal weightage. ""Seniority cannot be only criterion in appointment to such a critical post and experience in anti-corruption cases and prior experience of having served in the organisation should also be considered,"" the note said. His objection was, however, rejected because they felt he was the senior-most officer with highest grading, sources added. Sources also told NDTV that last year, RK Shukla's name was also shortlisted for the post of the Director of the Intelligence Bureau (DIB). But 1980-batch IPS officer Rajiv Jain, the present DIB, got an extention till June 2019. Mr Shukla had played a key role in the extradition of underworld don Abu Salem -- who was found guilty in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts which killed over 250 people -- and his then-girlfriend Monica Bedi in 2005, the source said. The post of the CBI chief had been vacant since the unceremonious exit of Alok Verma , who had been engaged in a bitter fight with his deputy and Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana over corruption allegations. Rishi Kumar Shukla is at present the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation. The tension between the two officers peaked after Mr Verma's team filed a police case against Mr Asthana, accusing him of accepting bribes from a businessman being investigated by the agency in a money laundering case. Both were sent on forced leave in October following the centre's intervention. Alok Verma was replaced by M Nageswara Rao, but a non-profit challenged his appointment as the acting CBI chief. On January 10, Alok Verma was removed as boss of the high-profile investigating agency by a panel led by PM Modi, just two days after the Supreme Court had reinstated him in the post. He was transferred to the Fire Services as Director General, after the panel said that as CBI chief, he had ""not acted with the integrity expected of him"". Congress's Mallikarjun Kharge, representing the opposition, put up a dissenting note saying that the vigilance inquiry had not found evidence that Mr Verma was guilty of bribery. The sacked officer refused to take charge as chief of fire services and quit. However, the Home Ministry has decided to conduct disciplinary proceedings against him for failing to take up the new job. On Friday, the Supreme Court had pulled up the centre for the delay in appointing the CBI chief and said it was ""averse"" to the arrangement of an interim CBI director. However, three top court judges recused themselves from the case for various reasons. The post of CBI director is ""sensitive"" and ""important"", and it is not good to keep an interim director of the agency for longer period, the top court had observed.

BJP Faces Pushback From Northeast Allies Over Citizenship Bill,BJP Faces Pushback From Northeast Allies Over Citizenship Bill,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-faces-pushback-from-northeast-allies-over-citizenship-bill-1987226,en,"The Bharatiya Janta Party may increasingly find it difficult to push through the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 fearing the risk of losing its allies in the Northeast, party sources have told NDTV. The region has been witnessing wide scale protests ever since the controversial Bill was introduced in Parliament earlier this month and passed by the Lok Sabha. In BJP-ruled Assam, protests have been taking place for the fifth week with the opposition Congress also taking out rallies across the state vehemently opposing the Bill. The agitation on the issue in Assam - a region where it has done phenomenally well since 2014 - has put the party on the back foot. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal recently told the assembly that the provisions of the Assam Accord will not be violated by the Citizenship bill. ""The Citizenship Bill is for entire nation, not only Assam... Then why unnecessary fear is being created among people? From where has this figure of 1.9 crore Hindu Bangladeshis coming to Assam emerged?,"" he told the Assembly. ""We should not confuse people by saying that Assamese identity and culture will be finished. The opposition should behave responsibly,"" he added. On Friday, Mr Sonowal claimed ""unnecessary social disturbance"" was being created over the bill ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. In a grand show of strength, 10 political parties based in the northeastern region, including BJP allies and the JD(U) came together on Tuesday to oppose the citizenship amendment bill and ensure that it is not passed in the Rajya Sabha. Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga, who was also present at the meeting, said that the bill which was ""dangerous and harmful for the people of the northeast."" A BJP leader was recently beaten up by those protesting against the citizenship amendment bill in Assam's Tinsukia district. In his address to parliament, the President also spoke on the bill. ""Citizenship Amendment Bill will make it easier to provide Indian citizenship to those who had to take refuge in India after facing oppression somewhere else. They were not at fault; they were victims of situations like that"" President Ram Nath Kovind told the parliament. But the President's address has failed to calm nerves. The BJP's popularity has also taken a hit in Tripura , where it came to power with the support of its tribal ally nearly a year back, creating electoral history. Now, the tribals in the state are cutting across political lines to protest against the controversial bill. ""We have all gathered non politically and send a message to (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi that first they should think of people of northeast, then migrant. It's not about politics but about our existence"" said Pradyot Manikya Debburman, Tripura 's Royal Scion and Working President of Congress in Tripura. Two BJP legislators in Meghalaya have threatened to quit the party if the bill is tabled in the Rajya Sabha. A delegation from the state headed by Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma is already in New Delhi meeting key NDA allies urging them not to vote in favour of the bill in Rajya Sabha. For the BJP, the 25 Lok Sabha seat in the northeast is very important. In 2014, it won eight seats on it own, while its allies won four. Rest of the 13 seats were won by non-NDA parties. Ever since the BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014, its average vote share in the northeast has grown 23.1 percentage points from 3.9% to 27%. Out of the 38.18 percent votes that the NDA got in Northeast in 2014, regional parties had got over 24 percent f those vote. In the 2014 general election BJP and its regional partners together got 38.18 percent of vote share, non NDA parties got 61.82 in the 25 seats in Northeast. Since 2014 BJP's vote share has increased to 27 percent in the region, while its allies vote share is 24.61 per cent. The Citizenship Amendment Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, but it has not been listed by the government in the Rajya Sabha where it is short on numbers. BJP's ally Janata Dal-United (JD-U) has already announced its opposition to the bill.

Indian Girl Students Fight To Stay Out After Dark: Foreign Media,Indian Girl Students Fight To Stay Out After Dark: Foreign Media,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-girl-students-fight-to-stay-out-after-dark-foreign-media-1987029,en,"Late one night in the fall, about 200 female students in Bhopal, a city in central India, held a rare demonstration on their college's basketball court. Their very presence there was an act of protest: Women were not allowed to be outside their dormitories after dark, just one of many restrictions on their movement. They spent the night outdoors - the first time many of them had seen the moon since they began college, one student recalled. For years, college campuses in India have regulated the movement of their female students in the name of safety. But in protests over the past several months, women on college campuses nationwide have voiced their demands: freedom from oppressive rules and equality with the male students. And slowly, colleges are responding. Protest by ""Pinjra Tod""or Break the Cage at Delhi University against hostel curfew. Women's access to education in India has improved vastly in the past three decades, but social change has been slower. Reported crime against women has doubled in the past 10 years, which experts say is a result of deeply embedded patriarchal attitudes that are also evidenced by the persistent preference for male children and the decline in the number of working women. The recent protests were inspired by a Delhi-based women's collective, Pinjra Tod, or ""Break the Cage,"" which campaigns against arbitrary curfews and rules imposed on female residents at colleges and universities - part of a broader battle by women's rights activists to take back public spaces and challenge the threat of sexual violence. They're fighting not just the curfew but also ""the idea of policing women and how they are kept in gendered spaces,"" said Joan Sony Cherian, a member of the collective. Women in India this month have entered a temple that once banned female visitors of menstruating age and prompted the dismissal of a professor for comparing virgins to ""a sealed bottle."" Last year, dozens of women shared stories of sexual harassment at workplaces as part of a burgeoning #MeToo movement. Women carried out months of protest against the hostel curfew in Delhi University. At Bhopal's Regional Institute of Education, which trains students to become teachers, the campus residences had strict rules for women. Female students had to be back in their dorm rooms by 5:30 p.m. in the winter, by 6:45 p.m. at other times. Leaving campus was allowed only between 1 to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. Food delivery was allowed only until 5:30 p.m. If a woman wanted to leave campus for a longer period, her parents were required to fax the request, after which two sets of administrative signatures were required. Female students did not have access to the rooftop terrace. For the men on campus, most of these rules did not apply. The women began their campaign with a sit-in, borrowing tactics and strategies developed by Break the Cage. Without their support, ""our protest would not have been at this scale,"" said Rai, a participating student, who spoke on the condition of partial anonymity to avoid possible retaliation by the college. On the third day of the protest, the administration relented. Now women don't have to return to campus until 8 p.m. and can remain outside their dorm rooms while on campus until 9 p.m. Later that week, a group of female students danced in a religious procession on campus in celebration. It was a new taste of freedom: Under the previous rules, they were locked in during festivals or could celebrate only in an enclosed space demarcated for them. The protests weren't limited to Bhopal. They spread. In some instances, they were inspired by previous protests; others happened spontaneously. Protest outside colleges after new hostel rules for Delhi University was announced. Female students at a branch of the Regional Institute of Education in Ajmer, a town in Rajasthan state, broke their curfew barely a week after the Bhopal protests. In October, students from Panjab University protested for 48 days. Protests led by Break the Cage at prestigious Delhi colleges such as Miranda House and Lady Shri Ram College soon followed. Administrators at the government-run Regional Institute of Education declined to comment on the protests. Lady Shri Ram College, a branch of Delhi University, said that the college had introduced changes such as ending the requirement for female students to have local guardians. The new rules were announced just before the planned protest. Pratibha Jolly, Miranda House principal, acknowledged that the old rules were ""archaic and major reform was overdue."" After last year's protest, the college made the curfew later and increased the number of nights a resident could stay out of the dorm. ""Our biggest challenge is to provide a safe, secure environment while nurturing liberal and progressive education for an extremely diverse student population,"" Jolly said. ""This requires nuanced responses."" But members of Break the Cage reject the safety argument. Devika Shekhawat, a member of the group, said women are aware of the risks. ""We want to change the spaces"" rather than force women to change their behavior, she said. Protesters hold up posters that show a bird flying out of a cage in Delhi University. Break the Cage has been advocating for women on campuses since 2015. While curfews have been central to its demands, it has also drawn attention to issues such as higher fees charged by dormitories for women, the lack of sexual harassment committees mandated by law, and moral policing of female students. The solidarity offered by Break the Cage has made a difference, said Kanupriya, 23, the student union president of Panjab University, who goes by one name. She led a successful campaign to scrap the dorm curfew. These successes alone will not bring about gender equality, Kanupriya said, but they are a way to move the needle: ""This is about changing what is considered normal.""

While one of them was completely naked, the other two had stripped down to their undergarments. The police contingent outside the secretariat immediately took them into custody. Last month, before the controversial bill was passed in the Lok Sabha, a group of Assamese youth had staged similar nude protests outside Parliament. Meanwhile, the ruling BJP in Assam today took out rallies in protests against the thrashing and manhandling of one of its district leader in Tinsukia earlier this week by anti-citizenship bill protesters. The BJP has now also decided to reach out to common people to explain why the party is going forward with the bill. Assam cabinet minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also claimed that the outlawed Independent faction of ULFA, led by Paresh Baruah, is behind the ongoing protests in the state. ""ULFA has a link to these protests. We are getting inputs. We are aware of whom all are receiving calls from ULFA and who are hatching these plans,"" Mr Sarma told reporters in Guwahati. The Citizenship Amendment Bill that seeks to remove hurdles in eligible migrants from six minority groups from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan from getting Indian citizenship is being strongly opposed across Northeast India. It has also been opposed by political parties including the Congress and Trinamool Congress.

Besides, the bandh a protest programme sponsored by the ruling Telugu Desam Party over the issue was also staged. The bandh and protest by and large did not affect normal life, though bus services were partially hit. State Road Transport Corporation workers too joined the agitation in some districts, partially affecting bus services. No untoward incident has been reported as the protests were continuing in a peaceful manner, a senior police official said. Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu shed his trademark light gold coloured outfit as he came to the assembly clad in a black shirt and white trouser while other TDP legislators wore black shirts in protest against the Centre''s ""apathetic attitude"" towards the state. In Vijayawada, TDP, Congress and Left parties' leaders staged a demonstration in front of the RTC bus station, raising slogans against the Narendra Modi government and blocking movement of buses. Some protesters lay down on the main road blocking movement of traffic. AP Congress Committee president N Raghuveera Reddy and Pratyeka Hoda Sadhana Samiti leader Chalasani Srinivas led the protest. Reports from Rajamahendravaram, Guntur, Kadapa and Visakhapatnam said bus services were partially affected because of the protests. Educational institutions were closed in many towns while practical examinations for Intermediate students scheduled for the day were postponed. The main opposition YSR Congress and the Jana Sena Party stayed away from the protest programme. The chief minister announced that the state-wide protests would continue till February 10.

Opposition Members Protest Amid Budget Presentation,Opposition Members Protest Amid Budget Presentation,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/opposition-members-protest-amid-budget-presentation-1986726,en," The nearly 100-minute presentation of the NDA government''s final Budget Friday intermittently witnessed noisy protests from opposition members and a spirited reaction from Treasury benches regularly thumping their desks. Presenting his first Budget, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal faced protests even before he began his speech as some Congress members shouted that the Budget has already been ""leaked"". They also sought to raise concerns over reports about the unemployment rate. At times, some Left members too were seen protesting at their seats. Opposition parties, including the Congress and the Left, alleged that proposals of the interim budget were leaked to the media even before the document was presented in the House. Some members held placards of news reports about unemployment figures. TDP members raised slogans demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh. When Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, in his budget speech, said the government aims to double the income of farmers, opposition members jeered. Members from the Treasury benches thumped desks to drown the protests by the opposition. During the presentation, Congress member Rajiv Satav walked up to Goyal and placed a sheet of paper, probably an article about unemployment rate, on his desk. He also kept a sheet of paper at Prime Minister Narendra Modi''s desk. Populist announcements, including some income tax exemption for the salaried class and direct cash transfer to farmers, elicited loud cheers from ruling members who chanted ''Modi Modi''. Congress President Rahul Gandhi was seen leaving the House during the Budget presentation. This prompted BJP members to launch an attack on him, saying ''Rahul baba bhag gaye''. The Congress President returned to his seat after some time. Rajesh Ranjan, an independent MP from Bihar, stood in the Well of the House with a few sheets of papers in his hands. After the presentation, Goyal turned towards Modi with folded hands. Soon after, a smiling Modi walked up to Goyal and patted him on his back. Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai, UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi and former J&K Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, were among those not present in the House.

Mr Malik alleged that Anna Hazare takes money from advocates to sit on protests and go on hunger strikes. Following the controversial statement made by Nawab Malik, Anna Hazare refused to meet NCP leaders, who were supposed to meet him on Thursday. Anna Hazare, the 81-year-old social activist, is currently protesting (since January 30) against the Centre and the Maharashtra government for not setting up a Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayukta in the state. ""If a senior leader of some political party (Nawab Malik) says that I have taken money from someone to start a hunger strike, then he should explain from where I took money. I have asked my workers to file a defamation suit against him,"" Anna Hazare said while speaking on the second day of his hunger strike as part of the 'Jan Andolan Satyagraha' in Maharashtra's Ralegan Siddhi. Speaking to news agency ANI, Anna Hazare said, ""Over 88 blocks in Maharashtra are protesting and supporting us in our movement. However, the government is trying to interfere as they want us to stop."" As per provisions of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, a Lokpal - an anti-corruption authority or ombudsman - would be set up at the Central level, while a Lokayukta will be set up in each state. Maharashtra minister Girish Mahajan, who has been acting as an emissary between the government and Anna Hazare, had on Tuesday, urged the activist to cancel the agitation, claiming that almost all the demands made by him were fulfilled. ""His first demand was implementing Swaminathan Commission recommendations, that farmers should get 1.5 times the MSP (Minimum Support Price). I think that demand has been fulfilled,"" Mr Mahajan told reporters in Mumbai. The Devendra Fadnavis Cabinet had on Tuesday decided to bring the office of the chief minister of Maharashtra under the jurisdiction of Lokayukta.

Thousands Protest Against Citizenship Bill In Meghalaya,Thousands Protest Against Citizenship Bill In Meghalaya,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/thousands-protest-against-citizenship-bill-in-meghalaya-1986228,en,"Thousands of people gathered in Meghalaya capital on Wednesday to participate in a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 even as various civil society groups threatened a ""severe agitation"" if the Bill is passed in the Rajya Sabha. Urban Affairs Minister Hamletson Dohling and Meghalaya State Planning Board Chairman, Lambor Malangiang were also present at the protest rally at Motphran, which was supported by more than a dozen civil society groups. ""Northeastern states will burn if this Bill becomes a law,"" Mr Dohling told the gathering as he appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh not to table the controversial Bill in the Rajya Sabha. The Lok Sabha has already passed the Bill that seeks to remove hurdles in eligible migrants from six minority groups from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan from getting Indian citizenship despite opposition by political parties including the Congress and Trinamool Congress. ""This Bill is an open invitation to these religious minority groups. This Bill is politics which will benefit only one political party. The Meghalaya government strongly opposes the Bill. This government (led by Conrad Sangma) is with the people of the state,"" Mr Dohling said. Urging the indigenous people of Meghalaya to stand united against the Bill, the North East Students' Organisation (NESO), the top students' body of all the indigenous communities in the north-eastern region, said the Bill will jeopardize the identity of the local communities. ""The Bill will be detrimental to the people northeastern states, especially Meghalaya, as Assam shares a large portion of the border with Bangladesh. The intention of the Central government is to reduce the indigenous people of the North-East to a minority in their own land,"" said NESO supremo Samuel Jyrwa.

"6 Indian Immigrant Detainees, On Hunger Strike, Force-Fed At US Centre","6 Indian Immigrant Detainees, On Hunger Strike, Force-Fed At US Centre",https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indians-on-hunger-strike-at-us-detention-centre-being-force-fed-1986850,en,"At least six immigrant detainees, including Indians, have been force-fed through nasal tubes by immigration authorities in the US after they went on a hunger strike to protest conditions at a processing centre in Texas, drawing a strong reaction from Indian-American groups which described it as violation of human rights. In a statement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said that as of Wednesday night, 11 detainees in El Paso had refused to eat; four other individuals at different ICE detention centres across the country were also on hunger strike, officials said. Of the 11 people starving themselves in El Paso, six were being hydrated and force-fed under court orders issued by a federal judge in mid-January - about two weeks after those detainees stopped eating, ICE said. Two of the 11 people began their hunger strike on Wednesday, officials added. ""The ICE Health Services Corps is medically monitoring the detainees'' health and regularly updating ICE of their medical status,"" the agency''s statement said. ""Efforts are being taken to protect the detainees'' health and privacy"". Ruby Kaur, a lawyer for two of the detainees in Texas says her clients, like the majority of those taking part in the hunger strike there, are Indian immigrants who entered the US through southern border more than six months ago and turned themselves in to officials. ""They have tubes that have been shoved through their noses and IV''s giving them fluids. It''s extremely painful and it''s against their will,"" Ms Kaur told NPR, adding that as recently as Thursday morning her clients told her in a phone conversation that they are experiencing nasal and rectal bleeding and vomiting. They began the hunger strike at the start of the new year to call attention to what they say are inhumane conditions, repeated verbal threats of deportation and debilitating angst created by a total absence of information about their impending asylum cases. Ms Kaur said that up until 10 days ago - about the time a federal judge ordered the nasogastric intubation - both of her clients and several others, were held in solitary confinement for two weeks ""to intimidate them"" into ending the protest. ""They want to get out and be with their families. They want move forward with their legal cases,"" Ms Kaur said, adding that each of her clients have extended family living in the US. Christina Fialho, the co-executive director of the nonprofit Freedom for Immigrants, said as many as 30 people could be on hunger strike in El Paso, a higher figure than the one ICE provided. The use of force-feeding, she said, represented an escalation in the tactics used by immigration officials on detainees. ""It''s barbaric,"" she added. An ICE spokeswoman did not comment directly on the allegations leveled by Ms Kaur and Fialho. But the agency said that it does not retaliate in any way against hunger strikers and that it tells detainees about the negative health effects of not eating, The New York Times reported. Th Indian-American community in the US has expressed concern over reports that that federal immigration officials are force-feeding Indian detainees. North American Punjabi Association (NAPA) in a statement said 11 Indian detainees at the El Paso Processing Center in Texas have been refusing food. ""Force-feeding to any immigrant is a violation of human rights,"" said NAPA executive director Satnam Singh Chahal. Some of the detainees have been on fast for more than 30 days, he said. ""They are now so weak that they cannot stand up or talk. This is learnt that they stopped eating to protest verbal abuse and threats of deportation from guards. They are also upset about lengthy lock ups while awaiting legal proceedings,"" he said. Instead of the authorities not addressing the detainees'' allegations of abuse, Chahal alleged that El Paso Processing Centre is not following the federal standards for care. ""The men with nasal tubes are having persistent nose bleeds, and are vomiting several times a day. They are not well. Their bodies are really weak, they can''t talk and they have been hospitalized, back and forth, they want to know why they are still in the jail and want to get their rights and wake up the government immigration system,"" he said. In a separate statement, South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) said that it is deeply disturbed by reports of staff at the El Paso, Texas detention processing centre force-feeding mostly Indian and Cuban detainees in the midst of a hunger strike. Up to 30 detainees, the majority of whom have pending asylum claims, went on a hunger strike after verbal and psychological abuse at the hands of ICE and detention centre staff at the notorious El Paso facility, SAALT said. ""Individuals should not have to put their bodies and lives on the line to draw attention to their indefinite detention. Our nation''s immigration system should provide protection from violence and persecution, yet current practices create an increasingly punitive asylum process, which only extends the violence and persecution asylum seekers are fleeing,"" Suman Raghunathan, SAALT executive director, said.

""My brother gave his life for the cause of the Assamese people. So did the 855 martyrs. Their sacrifice led to the Assam accord. The core fundamental of Assam accord is deportation of illegal migrants and there is no question of whether the migrant is Hindu or Muslim, if he is illegal, he has to be sent out. But this bill dilutes the Assam accord. Illegal Hindu migrants would get citizenship and we are opposed to this. This BJP government won election with a promise to save the land, culture and rights of indigenous people but now they are compromising their promise for votebank politics. We won't tolerate this,"" said Chandra Kanta Talukdar, younger brother of the first martyr of Assam agitation Khargeswar Talukdar. The martyrs' award comprises an amount of Rs 5 lakh and a memento. While the victim families have started returning the mementos, most of the families have expressed their inability to return the amount since they have already used the money in public works. Every year, December 10 is observed as Swahid Diwas (Martyrs' Day) in Assam to commemorate Late Khargeswar Talukdar, the first martyr of Assam Agitation. Talukdar was killed in police action on December 10, 1979. ""BJP has cheated the people of Assam over this bill.

Asia Bibi Could Leave Pak After Court Upholds Acquittal In Blasphemy Case,Asia Bibi Could Leave Pak After Court Upholds Acquittal In Blasphemy Case,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistan-supreme-court-rejects-challenge-against-asia-bibi-acquittal-1984968,en," Asia Bibi, the Christian woman at the centre of a blasphemy row which has ignited violent protests, been linked to two assassinations and spotlighted religious extremism in Pakistan, is expected to leave the country after its top court on Tuesday upheld her acquittal of the inflammatory charge. When she will leave and where she will go remain to be seen, however, with rampant unconfirmed speculation she will seek asylum in a North American or European country. Bibi, a labourer from Pakistan's central Punjab province, spent eight years awaiting execution before the Supreme Court overturned her death sentence for blasphemy in October last year -- prompting days of violent Islamist demonstrations. As part of a deal with protesters to end the violence, the government allowed a petition demanding an appeal against the court's acquittal. Bibi has been held in protective custody since, with authorities refusing to reveal her whereabouts for fear she will be targeted by vigilantes. But Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa -- considered Pakistan's top expert in criminal law -- threw the petition out ""on merit"" Tuesday, lifting the last legal hurdle in the case and paving the way for her to leave the country. Moments after the ruling was announced, Bibi's lawyer Saif-ul-Mulook hinted that his client's move could be imminent. ""I think at this time she is here (in Pakistan) -- but by tonight, I don't know,"" he told reporters outside the court. Extremists ""said they would kill her despite the judgement of the Supreme Court,"" he said. ""Therefore, I think she should leave the country."" ""She should now be free to reunite with her family and seek safety in a country of her choice,"" Amnesty International said in a statement echoed by other rights activists. Unconfirmed Pakistani reports claim her children have already fled to Canada. Judge frustrated Earlier Tuesday the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party, which led violent protests demanding Bibi's execution last year, called for its members to be ready for action. But most of its leaders remain in detention after a government crackdown, and few protesters could be seen at the court in Islamabad, where security appeared normal. That did not prevent the handful who did show up from calling for violence against Bibi prior to the court's ruling. ""If she goes abroad, don't Muslims live there?"" Hafiz Ehtisham Ahmed, an Islamist activist linked to the extremist Red Mosque in Islamabad, told AFP. ""If she goes out of Pakistan... anybody can kill her there."" Chief Justice Khosa expressed frustration at the furious reaction to Bibi's case by an extremist minority. ""Is this the face of Islam that we want to show to the world?"" he told the packed courtroom. He had harsh words for those who first brought the case against Bibi, and the Islamists who over the years have used it to ignite violence, threaten judges, and call for mutiny within the military. As for the protesters, he was incredulous. ""You block the entire country because a decision is not in your favour?"" he told the court. Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry, the lawyer who filed a petition on behalf of the cleric who made the original complaint against Bibi in 2009, remained unmoved. ""All religious scholars also verified later that this agreement was wrong. This was wrong,"" he said outside court. 'Justice! #AsiaBibi' Blasphemy remains a massively inflammatory issue in Pakistan, where even unproven accusations of insulting Islam can spark lynchings. Many cases see Muslims accusing Muslims, and rights activists say blasphemy charges are frequently used to settle personal scores. Minorities -- particularly Christians -- are often caught in the crossfire. Calls to reform colonial-era laws against blasphemy have provoked violence. In 2011 Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province who offered to support Bibi, was assassinated by his own bodyguard in Islamabad. ""Justice! #AsiaBibi"" his son Shehryar tweeted after Tuesday's decision. Taseer's murder was followed the same year by the killing of minority affairs minister Shahbaz Bhatti, a Catholic, who had also defended Bibi. ""This shameful delay in enforcing Asia Bibi's rights only reinforces the need for the Pakistani government to repeal the blasphemy laws as soon as possible,"" Amnesty stated. The EU called on Pakistan's government to protect Asia Bibi and her family, ""as they would do for any Pakistani citizen"". The allegations against Bibi date back to 2009, when Muslim women accused her of blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammed. The accusation emerged from an argument after Bibi was asked to fetch water while working in the fields, but the women objected to her touching the water bowl as a non-Muslim. Bibi has denied the charges, and her prosecution rallied international rights groups, politicians and religious figures. Pope Benedict XVI called for her release in 2010, while in 2015 her daughter met his successor Pope Francis.

Pak Supreme Court To Review Asia Bibi's Acquittal In Blasphemy Case,Pak Supreme Court To Review Asia Bibi's Acquittal In Blasphemy Case,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistan-supreme-court-to-review-asia-bibis-blasphemy-acquittal-1984420,en,"Pakistan's Supreme Court will on Tuesday begin a review of its own acquittal of a Christian woman charged with blasphemy, a verdict that sparked days of Islamist protests and threats and chaos across the country. Asia Bibi, who spent eight years on death row, has been in hiding since the Supreme Court freed her in October, with religious hardliners calling for her death and putting pressure on the government to prevent her from leaving the country. Most reviews of Supreme Court verdicts are dismissed immediately, but the politically sensitive nature of the case has added an extra layer of uncertainty. A three-judge panel, including the new Supreme Court Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, are due to hear the case. Bibi's lawyer, Saif-ul-Malook, who fled to Europe due to fears for his safety last year, said he expected the case to be dismissed. ""They have filed the petition on flimsy grounds. They haven't attempted to counter her release on constitutional grounds,"" said Malook, who returned to Pakistan this week and will represent Bibi in court. ""God willing, she will have the decision in her favour tomorrow. She will be a free person to go anywhere she wants to."" Bibi is widely expected to seek asylum abroad due to safety concerns, with Canada among the favourites to accept her. In November, Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau said his country was in talks with Pakistan about helping Bibi. Bibi, a farm worker, was condemned in 2010 over allegations that she made derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbours working in the fields with her objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She has always denied committing blasphemy. Leaders of the ultra-Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) group blocked main roads in Pakistan's biggest cites for three days after Bibi's acquittal, calling for the murder of the Supreme Court judges who freed her and urging their cooks and servants to kill them. The TLP called off the protests after striking a deal with the government that would see authorities seek to put Bibi on an ""exit control list"" barring her from leaving the country. The government later cracked down on TLP members, detaining more than 3,000 activists and pressing terrorism charges against the group's leaders. Bibi's case has outraged Christians worldwide and reignited a debate about Pakistan's draconian blasphemy law, which critics say is often abused and unfairly targets ethnic minorities. ""No one should be able to intimidate the Supreme Court into reversing a long-overdue ruling. Asia Bibi has been found to be innocent,"" said Omar Waraich, deputy South Asia director for Amnesty International. ""She should now finally be free to be reunited with her family and leave the country if she chooses.""

Some 10,000 people turned out for Sunday's counter-demonstration, a day after an 11th consecutive Saturday of ""yellow vest"" demonstrations across France that brought sporadic clashes with police. Participants, some wearing red scarves after the name of the counter-movement, displayed slogans like ""stop the violence"" and ""hands off my Republic"" in a peaceful afternoon procession in eastern Paris that ended in Bastille square. Saturday's ""yellow vest"" march in the capital also ended at Bastille, where small groups confronted police and a demonstrator suffered an eye wound that inflamed a debate about whether the authorities are using excessive force. The ""yellow vest"" protesters, who wear the fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to have in their cars, took to the streets in November to oppose a fuel tax rise. Their movement then developed into a broader revolt against the government. Around 69,000 people attended the latest Saturday protests, including 4,000 in Paris, a lower turnout than the previous weekend, the interior minister said. However, the injury to well-known activist Jerome Rodrigues attracted more television coverage on Sunday than the ""red scarves"" march, as it heightened debate over use by police of dispersal grenades and so-called ""flashball"" pellet guns. To help quell discontent, French President Macron this month launched a series of public debates that he has promised will lead to changes.

"Facing Protests, France Against ""Exorbitant"" Payoff For Ex-Renault Boss","Facing Protests, France Against ""Exorbitant"" Payoff For Ex-Renault Boss",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/france-warns-against-exorbitant-payoff-for-former-renault-chief-carlos-ghosn-1984122,en,"France's finance minister said on Sunday a severance package for former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn, forced to resign in a financial scandal, should not be ""exorbitant"" and that the French state would follow the matter closely. Renault, which this week appointed a chairman and chief executive tandem to replace Ghosn, has yet to finalise its former boss' severance package, a potentially explosive issue in France where the government is facing protests over low pay and inequality. ""No one would understand if the severance pay of Carlos Ghosn were exorbitant,"" Bruno Le Maire told France Inter radio. ""We are going to be extremely vigilant."" The French state is Renault's largest shareholder, with a stake of around 15 percent, and holds two board seats. Ghosn resigned from his Renault role last week under pressure from the French government following his arrest in Japan in November and indictment there for financial misconduct. He denies any wrongdoing. The scandal has strained Renault's alliance with Japan's Nissan, an industrial partnership Ghosn built into a global carmaking giant over two decades. France's CGT union has estimated Ghosn's severance package is worth 25-28 million euros ($28-32 million), in addition to an annual pension of 800,000 euros. Le Maire declined to say what he thought would be an acceptable pay-off for Ghosn, but said the government had previously succeeded in getting Ghosn's 2018 pay package reduced by 30 percent from his 2017 total of 7.4 million euros. The finance minister also said he would propose in the coming months legislation to require bosses of large companies based in France to make the country their tax domicile. The changes would target in particular big firms listed on the CAC-40 and SBF-120 indexes on the Paris stock market, along with groups in which the state has a holding, Le Maire said. The legislation would include sanctions for company chiefs that breached the rule, he added.

The FIR, filed after an audio clip went viral on social media, says the singer defamed the country's highest civilian award. It has not been verified if the voice in the audio clip is of Mr Garg. Zubeen Garg has been vocal against the BJP over the controversial bill. Earlier this month, the singer demanded that the BJP return the votes it got through his election song during the 2016 elections. Last week, Mr Garg released a new song against BJP and Citizenship (Amendment) bill. The song “ Politics No koriba Bondho ” ( Don't do politics my friend ) was an instant hit among youngsters. On January 8, Mr Garg had threatened to protest if Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal failed to take steps to scrap the controversial Bill within seven days. The singer had posted an emotional letter addressed to Mr Sonowal on social media along with his photograph holding the letter. ""Even if the Citizenship Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, Sarbada (Sarbananda Sonowal) can say no to it. Speak and see, rest will be seen later. I am still keeping my cool. I won't be in Assam for one week. It will be good if Sarbada takes some action before my return. Otherwise this time, I will agitate on my own. What I will do, I don't know,"" he said. While Zubeen Garg is yet to respond, police sources have indicated that they would investigative the allegations.

"Thousands Of ""Yellow Vests"" Back On France's Streets To Challenge Macron","Thousands Of ""Yellow Vests"" Back On France's Streets To Challenge Macron",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/yellow-vests-back-on-frances-streets-to-challenge-macron-1983796,en,"Thousands of ""yellow vest"" protesters returned to the streets of France Saturday to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's policies, clashing with police in several cities in a challenge to his bid to quell the movement. Police fired tear gas and water cannon to push back protesters at Place de la Bastille in Paris, one of the regular protest sites, as some demonstrators threw stones from a building site. The local prefecture reported 223 arrests in Paris. The interior ministry estimated numbers for the 11th week of protests were at 69,000 across France, compared to 84,000 last Saturday. In Paris, the official count was 4,000 demonstrators against 7,000 the previous weekend. Clashes erupted too in western France in Nantes and Evreux and in the southern city of Montpellier, where a police officer was injured by ""a pyrotechnic device"" said a statement from the local prefecture. In Paris and other cities, the yellow vest movement had called to continue the protests into the night. But police quickly dispersed several hundred protesters in the capital's symbolic Republique square using tear gas, water cannon and stun grenades to clear the area, AFP journalists said. The protests erupted in mid-November over Macron's economic reforms, but have since grown into a wider rallies calling for the resignation of the former investment banker who critics say is out of touch with the economic struggles of ordinary French people. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner on Twitter criticised ""rioters disguised as yellow vest protesters"" after Saturday's clashes. 'Keep the pressure on' The weekend's protests against Macron's tax and social policies came as divisions appeared among the yellow vests -- named after the high-visibility vests they wear -- as to where to take the movement. In a new political development, a 31-year-old nurse named Ingrid Levavasseur said this week she would lead a yellow vest list of candidates for the European elections in May. An initial survey in the wake of the announcement suggested they would garner a respectable 13 percent of the vote. But not every protester appeared to welcome this development. ""There is a hard core that is ready to keep fighting,"" said 42-year-old Gilbert Claro from the Paris suburbs. But the movement ""is not meant to be political"", he added. ""We have to keep the pressure on in the streets,"" to get their demands accepted, said Virginie, an activist in her 40s who said she had been involved in the protests from the beginning. She and many other protesters want a citizen-sponsored referendum so ordinary people can have more of a say in government policy. This idea has been consistently rejected by the government, although Macron made some concessions last December in a bid to end the protests. Recent opinion polls suggest that he has regained some of the ground lost during the crisis, as he has put his case at a series of town hall events around the country. The ""great national debate"" he initiated in response to the protests has nevertheless been dismissed as a public relations operation by many yellow vest protesters. A ""masquerade"", said Mathieu Styrna, a 36-year-old carpenter from northern France in Paris for the protests. His impression, he said, was that the participants had been selected. Night protests Outside Paris, several thousand protesters were marching in Bordeaux and Toulouse in the southwest, two of the cities where support for the movement has been consistently strong. In Bordeaux, police fired tear gas and water canon to break up small groups of protesters tossing fireworks and bottles as night fell. In the Mediterranean port city of Marseille, members of the CGT union joined the protests and about a thousand protesters turned out in the eastern city of Lyon. In the north, officials in the city of Evreux, Normandy, reported clashes there and damage to the police and Banque de France buildings. For the first time on Saturday, riot police using controversial defence ball launchers (LBDs) that shoot 40-millimetre (1.6-inch) rubber and foam rounds were equipped with cameras. A French court on Friday refused a bid brought by France's League for Human Rights (LDH) and the CGT to ban the weapons, blamed for serious injuries suffered by some demonstrators. The police authority in Paris announced the introduction of the cameras in a move for greater transparency. On Sunday, supporters of the government will stage their first ""red scarf"" protest to represent what they say is ""the silent majority"" defending ""democracy and its institutions"" and denouncing the violence of the yellow vests protests.

"As PM Modi Visits Tamil Nadu, Hashtag War On Twitter","As PM Modi Visits Tamil Nadu, Hashtag War On Twitter",https://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/gobackmodi-trends-ahead-of-pm-modi-s-tamil-nadu-visit-1983792,en,"In a major embarrassment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP, #GoBackModi is trending on Twitter as he is in Madurai in Tamil Nadu today for the foundation-laying ceremony of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The posts largely reflect the state's anger over PM Modi not visiting the districts in Tamil Nadu that were ravaged by cyclone Gaja that left more than 3 lakh homeless and uprooted around 11 lakh trees, crippling the livelihood of a huge population. A majority of tweets contain a cartoon that has an outline of Tamil Nadu with the face of late rationalist leader EVR Periyar saying ""Go Back Modi"". The Prime Minister, shown in a saffron jacket, is running towards a ladder lowered from a hovering chopper. Similar works with ""Go Back Modi"" have sprung up on Twitter and Facebook. Thousands of other tweets, meanwhile , welcomed PM Modi to Madurai and thanked him for setting up AIIMS in the city. Hashtags like #MaduraiThanksModi and #TNWelcomesModi too are among the top trends on Twitter. PM Modi's alleged silence over the Sterlite shooting in Tuticorin in which 13 anti-Sterlite protesters were shot dead by the police; the centre's reported pro-Karnataka approach in the Cauvery waters issue, particularly over the Mekedatu reservoir project across Cauvery which farmers in the state claim will deny them their share of Cauvery waters; and the implementation of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test or NEET for medical admission abolishing the state's Class 12 marks-based system for selection are some other issues that have left the southern state seething. ""We are not behind this. This reflects people's anger. The construction of the AIIMS hospital should have started two years ago and by now it should have become functional. Why did they delay the project? This foundation laying is just a gimmick before polls,"" DMK spokesperson A Saravanan told NDTV. This is the second time that the Prime Minister is facing this kind of an online backlash. In April last year, when he had visited Chennai for the Defence Expo, #GoBackModi had trended. Hundreds of protesters belonging to opposition parties had let black balloons in the air then. The Prime Minister had to use a chopper to attend an event at the IIT Madras to avoid protesters. At the time, the centre's alleged delay in constituting the Cauvery Management Board in view of the Karnataka assembly elections had triggered the anger. Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), party sources said, will lead a protest against PM Modi in Madurai today, several kilometres from the venues. The BJP has a negligible presence in Tamil Nadu and after Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, many say that the party is exploiting the weak leadership in the AIADMK to forge an alliance for the upcoming national election. They also claim that the state BJP is aiming to milk the proposed Rs 1,264 crore hospital project. But the BJP has dismissed the online anger as a ""paid campaign"". BJP spokesperson Thirupathy Narayanan told NDTV, ""This is a paid campaign by many groups online. We know who they are and we are ignoring the campaign."" There are also some voices that see the anti-Modi campaign to be unfair. Political analyst Dr Sumanth C Raman tweeted: ""Trending #GobackModi on this occasion is IMHO wrong. PM is coming tomorrow (Sunday) to lay the foundation stone for what one hopes will be a premier medical Institute in TN, the AIIMS. There hv been occasions for TN to feel aggrieved & let down by his Govt but this is not one of them"". The Prime Minister will also visit Kochi in Kerala today and unveil a plaque at an integrated refinery expansion complex of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. He will also lay the foundation stone for a petrochemical complex at the same venue, inaugurate a mounded storage vessel at an LPG bottling plant of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited in Kochi and lay the foundation stone for skill development institute at Ettumanoor in  Kottayam.

Bandhs and blockades hit daily wage earners the most, Mr Biren said, adding, he has appealed to the organisations multiple times not to resort to such kind of protests. ""We are duly elected legislators who have formed a government based on the mandate of the people.... Leaders of those (protesting) bodies should contest elections and get people''s mandate in order to participate in the decision-making meetings,"" Mr Biren said at the Manipur Rifles Parade Ground. At least five organisations, including the United Committee Manipur (UCM), All Manipur United Clubs Organisation (AMUCO) and Committee of Civil Societies Kangleipak (CCSK) jointly boycotted the 70th Republic Day celebrations to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016. ""Let the teachers, students and others carry out their respective duties,"" the chief minister said, warning that actions of these outfits would tantamount to running a ""parallel administration"", which is ""unacceptable"". In neighbouring Mizoram too, Governor Kummanam Rajasekharan addressed an almost-empty ground due to a statewide boycott call given by the NGO Coordination Committee, an organisation of civil society groups and student bodies. On the controversial bill, Mr Biren said the protesters should understand and analyse it first. The state government will not ""remain silent if the bill harms the interest of the people,"" he asserted. Manipur will also urge the Centre to include a provision or a clause within the framework of the rules, so as to enable the consent of the state government before granting citizenship, the chief minister said. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, passed in Lok Sabha on January 8, seeks to provide Indian citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Several outfits in the Northeast have opposed it claiming that it would undermine the rights of the indigenous people of the region.

The protests were mostly peaceful but there were sporadic clashes at the end of the Paris march at Bastille square, and incidents elsewhere around France, with a combined 22,000 people attending as of the early afternoon, the interior ministry said. The protests - named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to carry in their cars - began in mid-November over plans to raise fuel taxes before developing into a broader revolt against the government that mobilised tens of thousands each weekend. Turnout so far was lower than last Saturday, particularly in Paris. However, in a change of approach, some protesters have also called for an evening gathering, dubbed ""Yellow Night"", at Republic square, a common venue for demonstrations in Paris. In one of several processions in the capital, a few hundred demonstrators walked down the Champs-Elysees, the famous avenue that has been the scene of protests every weekend, and across town to Bastille square. As in previous weeks, protesters carried French flags and held signs attacking ""King Macron"" as out of touch or calling for referendums tabled by ordinary citizens. As the march converged on Bastille, small groups of protesters formed makeshift barriers, lit fires and threw projectiles at police, who responded with tear gas and water canon, television footage showed. Police made 42 arrests in Paris, prefectural authorities said. But as on the last two Saturdays in the capital, the incidents were minor compared with the violence seen in December - the worst trouble of its kind in decades in Paris. Elsewhere in France, protesters marched through the eastern city of Strasbourg to the European Parliament. In the southwest, marches took place in Bordeaux and Toulouse, which have been focal points of the movement, while there were some confrontations during protests in Marseille and Lyon. To help quell discontent, Macron this month launched a series of public debates that he promised will lead to measures. In a sign of divisions within the movement, some ""yellow vests"" have proposed a list of candidates to run in May's election for the European Parliament, a move attacked as a betrayal by other activists. Those opposed to the movement, meanwhile, are planning a counter-demonstration in Paris on Sunday, mainly to condemn the violence seen during the protests.

The workers of Shiv Sena on Thursday staged a protest outside a theatre in Vashi, against the theatre's management for not installing posters of the film inside the theatre. In a video from the incident, the group of protestors can be seen staging a sit-in protest and shouting slogans. During the protest, the workers also got into an argument with the theatre staff. Based on the life of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, the film hit the big screens on Friday, commemorating Bal Thackeray's birth anniversary. Shortly after the trailer of the film came out in December, the release date of the film attracted a lot of controversies. Many claimed that the film is deliberately being released ahead of elections as part of a political agenda. However, in an exclusive interaction with ANI, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who plays the role of Bal Thackeray in the film and Amrita Rao, who will feature as his wife Mina Thackeray, refuted those claims and asserted that the only reason behind releasing the film in January was that January 23 is Bal Thackeray's birth date.

Many underground militant groups have also called a boycott. Security forces across the Northeast are on high alert following the boycott call given by militant groups. In Nagaland, the powerful Naga Students' Federation (NSF) has demanded that the state government should make its stand clear on whether it is for or against the bill. The NSF said that the state should not confuse the public with statements and counter-statements. In Manipur, five civil society organisations called for boycott of Republic Day celebrations and in Mizoram, a non-profit group, an umbrella organisation of civil societies and student bodies, has also called for a boycott. The influential People's Representation for Identity and Status of Mizoram (PRISM) announced that it will not participate in the Republic Day functions today. Meanwhile during an anti-bill rally on Wednesday, many anti-India placards where seen in Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram. Such placards where common in the state during the insurgency period, said locals. Although militant groups in the Northeast routinely call for boycotting Republic Day and Independent Day celebrations, it has become part of a larger issue this year.

""The Modi government has neither the electoral mandate nor electoral legitimacy to present its 6th full budget in 5 years,"" Mr Tewari told the media. Pointing to the fact that the term of the present government ends on May 26, Mr Tewari said: ""From where does the government derive the locus to present budget for 365 days? ""Seeking to hide the economic mismanagement in the last 5 years, it is resorting to complete violation of Constitutional propriety and parliamentary procedures and norms,"" said Mr Tewari, adding that the Congress will oppose it tooth and nail inside and outside Parliament.

The apparently controversial poster titled ""Democracy in Telangana"" shows voters as Draupadi being 'disrobed' by the Election Commission of India (ECI), which is shown as the Kauravas and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao and Asaduddin Owaisi, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief, standing on either side as silent spectators. The Congress held a protest against the alleged failures of the poll panel to ensure a free-and-fair assembly elections in the state. Telangana BJP spokesperson, Krishna Sagar Rao questioned whether the newly-appointed Congress general secretary, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would ""approve"" of women and Hindu mythological characters being used in cartoons. The poster titled ""Democracy in Telangana"" shows voters as Draupadi being 'disrobed'. The AIMIM chief, who also features in the cartoon, said that though it is everyone's right to protest, the way Congress workers used Draupadi in the poster ""was completely wrong."" ""What if someone creates a cartoon of Sonia, Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi. How would the party react? I respect Sonia Gandhi a lot. The Congress party can protest for their rights but not in such a way that insults women,"" said Mr Owaisi. The Telangana Congress election committee chief, Marri Shashidhar Reddy said that he found nothing wrong in the posters. ""The BJP must be out of their mind for seeking an apology from Rahul Gandhi and local Congress leaders. I will take complete responsibility for this poster. It has nothing to do with Hindu sentiment as it is a depiction showing what democracy in Telangana is being subjected to...The Election Commission is silent and they have failed to identify the mistakes in the electoral rolls.

The boycott is being pushed by the Co-ordination Committee (CorCom), an umbrella organisation of banned terrorist groups in Manipur, besides the Paresh Baruah-led United Liberation Front of Assam-Independent and the National Liberation Front of Tripura. In a press statement, they accused the centre of trying to implement a hidden agenda through the controversial legislation. ""They detected more than three million ""illegal migrants"" during updation of the National Register of Citizens in Assam. This number does not include a large chunk of migrants from India and elsewhere. The indigenous people of Tripura have been systematically outnumbered and marginalised. The tribal states of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland are facing massive pressure by Indian migrants, particularly in urban clusters and resource-extraction areas. Manipur has been resisting the onslaught of the demographic invasion,"" the statement read. The militant groups also protested alleged police atrocities against those protesting the controversial legislation, and the levelling of sedition charges against activists and intellectuals who have voiced their dissent. Although terrorist groups in the Northeast routinely call for boycotting Republic and Independent Day celebrations, it has become part of a larger issue this time. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, passed in the Lok Sabha on January 8, seeks to amend the Citizenship Act-1955 for granting expedited Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from three neighbouring countries. While people hit the streets to protest against facilitating the entry of outsiders, social groups alleged discrimination against immigrants on religious grounds. At least four chief ministers from the Northeast have raised their concerns on the bill until now. Recently, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma and Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga visited the national capital in a combined effort to make the centre scrap the controversial legislation in the face of raging protests across the region. Mr Sangma's National People's Party and Mr Zoramthanga's Mizo People's Front are both part of the National Democratic Alliance.

The chief minister's media advisor, Irengbam Arun today said the CM has called the meeting at his official residence on January 29 morning to discuss the Bill. The BJP is heading a coalition government in the state with the National People's Party, Naga People''s Front and the Lok Janshakti Party. Protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) are continuing in the state with people taking out processions and holding sit-ins in various districts demanding that the Bill be withdrawn. Manipur People's Party (MPP), many students' organisations and civil society players in the state are against the CAB. MPP president O Jugindro had earlier said his party would oppose the Bill tooth and nail. He said the Bill, if passed in the Rajya Sabha, would reduce the population of indigenous people of the northeastern states, including Manipur, to ""microscopic minority"". Six students'' organisation of the state along with the women organisation ''Meira Paibi'' have also announced that they would launch agitation against CAB at New Delhi when the Bill would be introduced in the Rajya Sabha. The chief minister has earlier said the Bill will have no effect on the state. The Manipur Cabinet in its January 10 meeting chaired by the chief minister had urged the Centre to exempt the state from the jurisdiction of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. The state cabinet in the same meeting also decided to urge the Centre and authorities concerned to give assent to the Manipur Peoples'' (Protection) Bill, 2018 passed by the state assembly. The Manipur Peoples' (Protection) Bill, 2018 defines Manipuris and non-Manipuris and seeks to protect the interests and identity of the indigenous people. The Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on January 8.

The farmers protested in Gauriganj town in Amethi district on Wednesday demanding that either their land that was given to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation should be returned or they are provided employment. Rahul Gandhi yesterday visited Amethi for campaigning for the general elections. One of the protesters, Sanjay Sing told ANI: ""We are very upset with Rahul Gandhi. He should go back to Italy. He does not deserve to be here. Rahul has grabbed our land."" They staged the protest near Samrat Cycle factory, which was inaugurated by former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi when he was the Lok Sabha lawmaker from Amethi. In the 1980s, Jain brothers had taken over 65.57 acres of land in the industrial area of Kausar to run a company but after its failure, a land auction took place in 2014. According to the records, UP State Industrial Development Corporation (UPSIDC) had leased 65.57 acres of land to the company in 1986 but when the company was closed down, the Debts Recovery Tribunal got it auctioned in 2014 at Rs. 20.10 crore to recover the loan. The land purchased in the auction was paid by the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust for stamp duty of Rs. 1,50,000. However, later the land auction process was termed invalid by the UPSIDC after which a Gauriganj SDM Court ordered the return of the land of the Samrat Cycle Factory to UPSIDC. Since then the land is on papers with UPSIDC but is still occupied by the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. Earlier, Union Minister Smriti Irani had also accused Rahul Gandhi of grabbing the land of farmers through the foundation.

The accused has been produced before a city court and placed in police custody, it added. The arrest of the accused -- Abhishek Mishra -- from the Madhya Pradesh capital had given rise to a major controversy, with the state police complaining that they were not informed about the Delhi Police's operation. The state police has lodged a strong objection with Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik, asserting that Mr Mishra's clandestine arrest amounts to violating Supreme Court directives. Madhya Pradesh police claimed that a few unidentified people arrived at Mr Mishra's residence in Bhopal's Rajeev Nagar around 8:30 pm that day and whisked him away in a waiting vehicle. As nobody identified them as policemen, it was initially feared that he had been abducted. A subsequent investigation revealed that he had been arrested by Praveen Kumar, Inspector of the Cyber Crime Unit (Special Cell), Delhi Police. The Madhya Pradesh Home Department, in its letter to Mr Patnaik, said an investigation should be launched into the police operation. It also wanted the Delhi police to inform it of action taken against the officer responsible for the ""inappropriate act"".

Sabarimala Temple Closes After Annual Pilgrimage Season; Political War On,Sabarimala Temple Closes After Annual Pilgrimage Season; Political War On,https://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/sabarimala-temple-closes-after-annual-pilgrimage-season-political-war-on-1980579,en,"After witnessing unprecedented protests over the entry of women of menstruating age, the Lord Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala was closed on Sunday marking the culmination of the over two-month-long stormy annual pilgrimage season. As the temple closed, the opposition BJP ended its 49-day-long relay hunger strike staged in front of the Secretariat, the administrative hub in Thiruvananthapuram, demanding the lifting of prohibitory orders and restrictions at Sabarimala, which the LDF government rejected. While Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday lashed out at the Sangh Parivar and said their Sabarimala stir was a ""complete failure"", BJP state president PS Sreedharan Pillai claimed the agitations were aimed at protecting the traditional faith of devotees and it had won in garnering mass support. The Sabarimala Karma Samithi, the rightwing forum which spearheaded the agitations against the entry of young women into the shrine, is all set to organise a mass gathering of devotees, spiritual and cultural leaders in the state capital this evening. The sanctum sanctorum of the hill temple was closed at 6.15 am after darshan by P Raghava Varma Raja, representative of the erstwhile Pandalam royal family, attached to the centuries-old shrine. After the customary ''bhasmabhishekam'' , the portals of the shrine were closed with the singing of ''Harivarasanam''. With this, the tumultuous 67-day long annual pilgrimage season at Sabarimala concluded and the Lord Ayyappa temple would be reopened on February 13 for the monthly poojas in the Malayalam month, Kumbham, sources said. The annual pilgrimage season this time witnessed widespread protests from frenzied devotees and rightwing groups over the CPI(M)-led LDF government's decision to implement the September 28 Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the hilltop shrine. The decision of the state government was described as a ""shameful act"" by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he attended a BJP convention at Kollam in southern Kerala. Traditionally, women of menstruating age or in the age group of 10 to 50 years were not allowed to enter the temple as the deity, Lord Ayyappa, was in the form of ""Naishtika brahmachari"" (perennial celibate). The temple witnessed the first round of protests during the monthly ''Thulamasa'' pooja when it was opened for five days in October. Several mediapersons and women devotees of traditionally accepted age were injured in the protests which were spearheaded by the BJP-RSS led groups. Later, when the temple was opened for the annual pilgrimage season on November 17, the situation at Sannidhanam (temple complex), which is around 3.5 kilometre uphill from Pamba, was calm but the state witnessed frenzied protests from the right-wing groups under the aegis of ""Sabarimala Karma Samiti."" During the melee, BJP leaders K Surendran, K P Sasikala attempted to visit the shrine defying the prohibitory orders but were arrested. The Sabarimala Karma Samiti held an event ''Ayyappa Jyothi'' (lighting of sacred lamp) on December 26, to protest against the government''s decision, which the LDF government countered by organising a 620-km-long ""women''s wall"" across the state. During the season, over two dozen women devotees, of whom some were branded as activists, unsuccessfully attempted to trek the hill. However, on January 2, two women of the traditionally barred age group--Kanakadurga (44) and Bindhu (42)-- trekked the hill and offered prayers at the shrine without facing any troubles from the devotees. This led to widespread violence across the state and the Samiti, with the support of BJP, called for a shutdown on January 3.

Sister Neena Rose, who is staying with the survivor nun, has been asked to report to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation's Jalandhar convent and meet its Superior General Sr Regina Kandamthottu on January 26. The congregation head accused sister Rose of carrying on with the ''rebellious'' posture refusing to be part of the community and its daily religious life. Earlier, the head had issued transfer orders to four nuns who took part in the protest, demanding the arrest of the Bishop. In her letter to Rose , the superior general of the congregation had warned that failure to comply with the advice to report in person as instructed would be construed as a deliberate refusal to abide by the legitimate order of her Mother General, thereby challenging the authority canonically bestowed on her. Earlier, the four nuns and the survivor nun had written to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, seeking his intervention to ensure that their transfer orders were not affected till the trial of the case was over. The letter to the chief minister was written after four of the five nuns, who led the protest against the Bishop last year, were directed to leave their convent in Kottayam district, in compliance with a transfer order issued by their congregation last year. ""Their aim is to single me out and to harass and torture me. My life will be in danger if such a situation arises,"" the survivor nun has alleged in her letter. Their congregation -- Missionaries of Jesus under the Jalandhar diocese of the Roman Catholic Church -- has directed the nuns to join their previously-assigned convents, according to the transfer orders issued between March and May this year. The nuns - Alphy, Anupama, Josephine and Ancitta - were served notice by the superior general of the congregation, Regina Kadamthottu, urging them to take up their assigned responsibilities as befitting members of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation. The protest led by the nuns and the Catholic reformist forums in September last year had led to a public outrage and demands for action against the bishop. Bishop Mulakkal, a senior member of the Roman Catholic clergy in India, was arrested last year following allegations by the nun that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted her at the Kuravilangad convent between 2014 and 2016, a charge denied by him.

The demonstrations were largely peaceful but Reuters Television reporters said they saw clashes break out late in the afternoon between police and demonstrators, some wearing masks, in Paris' Invalides district. Protesters threw firecrackers, bottles and stones at the police who responded with water canon and tear gas to push them back. Officials said there were around 7,000 demonstrators in Paris and 27,000 across France. A Reuters reporter also said there had been clashes in the southern port city of Marseille, while similar demonstrations took place in other cities across France. ""Macron, resign!"" some of the protesters shouted. Some also carried mock coffins symbolising the 10 people who have died during the protests, mainly due to accidents when demonstrators blocked roads. The ""yellow vest"" protests - which make use of fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to carry in their cars - began in November over higher fuel taxes. Those fuel taxes were subsequently scrapped, yet the movement has morphed into a broader anti-Macron protest. December's demonstrations wreaked some of the worst violence seen in decades in Paris, as rioters burned cars and damaged shops and businesses. Protests this month have not witnessed the same level of trouble, although video of a former French boxing champion punching and kicking police in Paris shocked many.

The party has been spearheading the nearly two-month-long agitation against the decision of the Kerala government to implement the Supreme Court order allowing entry of women of all age groups into the shrine of Lord Ayyappa. Speaking at the venue of the protest, state BJP president PS Sreedharan Pillai said the party would end the indefinite fast on Sunday. ""There were notable achievements during certain phases of the agitation, but, our fight to protect the faith was not entirely successful,"" he said. ""Even though we were unable to achieve 100 per cent success, we were able to garner more public support due to the blessings of Lord Ayyappa,"" Mr Pillai said at the protest venue in front of the Secretariat. The protest lost steam at a point of time when the BJP was unable to field known leaders to take part in the indefinite relay fast. The fast was started by party general secretary AN Radhakrishnan followed by CK Padmanabhan and Shobha Surendran, among others. Meanwhile, the BJP-led by National Democratic Alliance (NDA) met Kerala Governor P Sathasivam and submitted a memorandum seeking withdrawal of ''fabricated'' cases registered against ''devotees'' on the Sabarimala issue. The memorandum, with around one crore signatures from people from Kerala and elsewhere, seeks to end the police restrictions at the hilltop shrine. Mr Pillai, who led the delegation, sought the release the activists who were jailed during the recent protests on the women's entry issue. ""Around 5,000 fabricated cases have been registered against the devotees who protested. Almost 1,000 activists are still in jail. They must be released,"" he said. Besides, there were demands to end the alleged police raj at the shrine and withdrawal of prohibitory orders at Sabarimala, a senior BJP leader told PTI. Besides Mr Pillai, the lone BJP MLA in the state O Rajagopal, Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) leader Gopakumar and former Kerala Congress leader PC Thomas, among others, also were part of the NDA team that met the governor. The prohibitory orders ended on January 14, the Makaravilakku festival day. However, a BJP leader said their memorandum seeks to reduce the police restrictions which may come up next time when the shrine opens for monthly pooja. Meanwhile, two women in their late 30s, who came to offer prayers at the shrine, were turned back by the police apprehending protest by devotees. The state had witnessed ""nama japam "" protests by BJP, RSS and right outfits over the entry of young women into the shrine, where the deity is Naishtika Brahmachari (perennial celibate).

Artists Protest Loyola College's Apology Over Satirical Paintings Row,Artists Protest Loyola College's Apology Over Satirical Paintings Row,https://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/artists-protest-loyola-colleges-apology-over-satirical-paintings-row-1982262,en,"Artists in Chennai are unhappy that Loyola College has apologised for display of satirical paintings on contemporary issues on campus. On Monday, the Catholic minority institution now at the centre of a controversy over art works put up by a cultural group not from the college had apologised after right wing Hindu groups alleged that some of the paintings hurt Hindu sentiments. ""We acknowledge our lapse and apologise for insurmountable hurt. The venue for a cultural event was misused. We've immediately removed the exhibits. We are pained our pluralistic campus was used for derogative exhibits. We do not advocate anything tantamount to peace and tranquility of society,"" the college said in a statement. Cartoonist Bala, who was arrested in 2017 for a caricature of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, says stifling freedom of expression has become the norm in Tamil Nadu. ""The college should not have apologised. It was not their work in the first place. I find nothing wrong with those paintings . It's an expression of a cartoonist's view. Whether the idea is right or wrong an artist should have the right to express,"" he said. Recently, Lois Sophia, a woman researcher was arrested for criticising the state BJP chief Tamilisai Soundararajan. The ruling AIADMK had also banned Kamal Haasan's certified film Vishwaroopam till legal intervention. Similarly, Actor Vijay's films Mersel and Sarkar too faced heat from BJP and AIADMK for taking on Centre's GST and state's freebies. Among the paintings found to be offensive by the right wing Hindu groups is one that shows Bharat Mata as a sexual harassment victim in the context of #MeToo. Some other paintings target the BJP and the Prime Minister on the Rafale fighter jet deal besides taking on the RSS for denying entry of women of menstrual age at Sabarimala temple. One painting shows a menstruating woman chained to a trident. Narayanan Thirupathy, BJP Spokesperson, said, ""It's a premeditated insult by the college against Hindu religion. It's not a contemporary issue. To use Bharat Mata with #MeToo, is freedom of expression?"" Call it satire on contemporary issues or deliberately hurting of sentiments, the state BJP has already made this a Christian vs Hindu issue. Many say the controversy yet again reflects the rising intolerance towards criticism in Tamil Nadu that even institutions nurturing critical thinking choose to not stand up to.

Addressing ""United India Rally"" being organised by Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, Mr Sinha said that the opposition leaders had gathered at the mega-rally not to remove one man, but the kind of thought and ideology he stands for. ""Modiji is not the issue here, issues are the issue. There is no democratic institution in this country that this government has not compromised,"" he said. Mr Sinha, a former minister in the NDA government and a known critic of the PM, said democracy has been under attack under the present government. ""While praising the government was ""desh bhakti""(patriotism), criticising it is ""desh drohi"" (sedition),"" he said. The former BJP leader also accused the BJP government of manipulating the developmental statistics to downgrade the previous governments. ""After Independence this is the first government which has been presenting decorated and inflated developmental statistics to befool people,"" he said apparently referring to the Niti Aayog downgrading GDP growth rate during UPA time. Mr Sinha, who was in a committee to find solution to the Kashmir problem said when he had suggested to talk to the cross-section of people in the environment of love, he was branded a ""Pakistani agent"".

Although Congress president Rahul Gandhi could not make it to the event, he had extended his support in a letter addressed to the Trinamool chief yesterday.

"In Third Year, US Women's Marches Turn To 2020 Elections","In Third Year, US Women's Marches Turn To 2020 Elections",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-third-year-us-womens-marches-turn-to-2020-elections-1979421,en,"Two years after filling the streets of US cities to protest the start of Donald Trump's presidency, women will march again this weekend to try to build political pressure against him ahead of the 2020 elections. The loose movement around the marches has splintered as it enters its third year, and one of the various groups now involved has faced criticism it is anti-Semitic, which it denies. But leaders of the groups say momentum has not slowed, and the rallies will celebrate unprecedented gains for women in congressional and state races in last year's midterm elections. Millions of people took part in the women's marches in Washington and other cities in the United States and abroad on January 21, 2017, the day after the Republican president was sworn in. Vanessa Wruble, a co-founder of the original Women's March on Washington who left to start March On, a separate grassroots coalition, said the movement has evolved from being a reaction to Trump's presidency. It was ""essentially the resistance movement, and now you see the movement being far more proactive,"" she said. Women's March, a national nonprofit organisation that evolved from the initial Washington march, is using its #WomensWave marches in Washington and elsewhere on Saturday to roll out a 10-part policy platform that includes raising the federal minimum wage and protecting reproductive rights. ""Women are just not on the agenda in this current administration,"" Women's March Chief Operating Officer Rachel Carmona said. March On will kick off an initiative to mobilise women voters by hosting a ""March on the Polls 2020"" on Saturday in dozens of cities, including Boston and Denver. Dozens of like-minded organizations will host training sessions for activists and prospective candidates. More than 400 women have applied to attend a candidate training session this weekend in Washington hosted by Emily's List, an organisation that works to elect women who support abortion rights, said spokeswoman Tonya Williams. Wruble said the 2018 elections showed the movement had ""shifted the balance of power"" in American politics. More women were elected to the US Congress than ever before and many of the new Democratic women lawmakers cited Trump's presidency among the reasons they decided to run for office. Of course, women are not all united around the same causes. The annual ""March for Life"" by anti-abortion campaigners, which takes place in Washington on Friday, is a movement of people who broadly embrace Trump and Republicans. People participated in a Women's March to protest against US President Donald Trump in New York City Grass-Roots Efforts At the outset, March On was bankrolled by leaders covering expenses out of pocket, but it raised a ""sizeable"" amount of money in 2018 and aims to raise $2 million in 2019, Wruble said. March On distributes funds to local affiliates for on-the-ground planning, provides design assistance for websites and logos and gives access to a public relations firm. In February and March, the group's leaders will meet with affiliates to determine how best to support their efforts over the next election cycle. ""This year is really going to be about increasing our tool chest of what we offer to them,"" said March On's Natalie Sanchez, an organizer of the 2017 Boston Women's March who is also with March Forward Massachusetts, which is leading Saturday's march there. The Women's March now counts national progressive groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Move On among its partners. March On partners include the ACLU, Rock the Vote and Emerge America, which recruits Democratic women to run for office. Women's March's Carmona said she spends 60 hours a week on planning calls, including ""chapter"" calls with 30 to 45 local organizations. The group did a 10-state tour ahead of last year's congressional elections and is developing a nationwide strategy that would train more local leaders ahead of the 2020 presidential contest, she said. There have been growing pains in a movement that grew out of hundreds of loosely affiliated marches in 2017. In cities such as New York, there will be multiple events on Saturday hosted by different organizations, largely due to calls by some religious leaders to boycott Women's March over criticism that some of its leaders are anti-Semitic. Women's March leader Linda Sarsour issued a statement condemning all forms of anti-Semitism and bigotry. Leaders Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland reiterated on ABC's talk show programme ""The View"" this week that they were committed to a movement that fought all forms of oppression. Leaders of Women's March and March On insist the divisions are not a weakness. ""I know there have been controversies this year and rifts and divides and those may or may not affect numbers on particular marches, but I haven't seen that have any effect on the movement's strength over all,"" Wruble said. Carmona said ""there is a role for everyone"" no matter which group they join, adding decentralized movements had a kind of power that is ""hard to strike at.""

Sarbananda Sonowal Under Pressure As Neighbours Oppose Citizenship Bill,Sarbananda Sonowal Under Pressure As Neighbours Oppose Citizenship Bill,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sarbananda-sonowal-under-pressure-as-neighbours-oppose-citizenship-bill-1978819,en,"Cornered over widespread protests in the state over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016, which has been passed in Lok Sabha on January 8, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal today reassured agitators that he would 'never betray them'. The BJP had come to power in the state in 2016. ""The people of Assam have made me the chief minister with lots of trust and confidence. I have not come here to betray them. I shall work for the development of Assam till the last moment,"" said the chief minister while addressing a meeting at Dhubri in Assam. The Chief Minister had been criticised for not considering the popular sentiment in the state against the controversial bill. Pressure increased on Mr Sonowal after the state government of Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland opposed the bill. The Meghalaya cabinet has already passed a resolution opposing the bill, with even its lone BJP minister siding with the majority. In Meghalaya, Sofiur Rahman, head of the State BJP's Minority Morcha, resigned from the party in protest the bill. He has warned the party of an impending defeat if it tables the bill in the Rajya Sabha. ""You'll see one day, only we can protect the Assamese race. I am the Chief Minister and I am here to establish peace following the ideologies of Dr Bhupen Hazarika and Hemanga Biswas,"" Mr Sonowal added. At least four BJP MLAs, including speaker of state legislative assembly Hitendra Nath Goswami, have aired their opposition to the bill. The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) that cut ties with the BJP over the bill, has decided to launch state-wide protests from January 18. The Citizenship Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to grant Indian citizenship to the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who fled religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and entered India before December 31, 2014, after six years of residence in the country, instead of the current 12 years, even if they do not have any proper documents.

Denying reports about the outfit opposing the period drama, its national spokesperson Dr Himanshu said Shri Rajput Karni Sena's name is being used for vested interests. ""We are not opposing 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' till we don't have anything substantial from the family, region or the community,"" Himanshu told IANS over the phone. ""These people, I believe, are using the name of Karni Sena for their own vested interests and they are bringing disrepute to Karni Sena and to the historical characters,"" he added. ""Manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi"" captures the life story of Rani Laxmibai and her fight against the British. Kangana Ranaut plays the lead role in the film, produced by Zee Studios in association with Kamal Jain and Nishant Pitti, and releasing on January 25. According to reports, the Maharashtra wing of the Karni Sena protested against the film on Thursday alleging that the period drama ""alludes to Rani Laxmibai's relationship with a British officer"". The reports also said Karni Sena is opposed to the film showing the queen dancing to a special number, saying it is against tradition. They asked the makers of the film to show them the movie before its release. Himanshu says ""we disown and completely dissociate ourselves"" from all such claims. ""Supposedly, the family has a problem. They can come to us and if they seek support from us and have a valid reason (we will take it in consideration)... I was in Jhansi recently and nobody said anything of this nature,"" Himanshu said. He continued: ""Our approach is very clear, if the family, community or the region approaches us or the historians have some reservations... Supposedly, they approach us and we are convinced with the logic of that, we will take a stand. But we will cross the bridge when the river comes."" Himanshu says ""this is the official stand of Karni Sena"". ""First and foremost, we should be clear which Karni Sena (has protested). Anybody who pops up and says 'I am Karni Sena', cannot be Karni Sena."" Asked if he thinks the outfit's name is being used for vested interests, Himanshu said: ""Yes. In the case of 'Padmaavat', some people became Karni Sena members. They were prominent faces on TV claiming to be from Karni Sena. But in the last 12 years, we didn't even see them once. They bring a bad name to us."" He says the objection should either come from ""the family or the historians as in the case of 'Padmaavat'"". Recalling the whole stir around ""Padmaavat"", based on 16th century poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi's poem ""Padmavat"", Himanshu said: ""The family had reservations and they were not consulted... We had reached out to the government, the states and the censor board as well. We went to almost every Chief Minister and 11 CMs gave it to us in writing that they had reservations about the movie. ""Either the protests should be proper, or it should have some substance. Protests just for the sake and somebody running the shop in the name of the Karni Sena is objectionable from our side and it should be discouraged from the media side also.""

The two leaders visited Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and told him that all the six coalition partners -- including the United Democratic Party and People's Democratic Front -- believed that the bill would disrupt the social fabric of Meghalaya and the Northeast by causing law-and-order problems in the region. ""The Citizenship Amendment Bill will affect the Northeast to a great extent. The bill is against the spirit of its people of North East, and is likely to give rise to serious repercussions.

Kerala police warned them about protestors who had gathered at Pamba, which is around 5 km away from Sabarimala temple. The women, identified as Reshma Niashanth and Shanila, attempted the reach Sabarimala temple last week as well, but had been stopped from doing so. The women had reached Nilakkal with a team of six other men today, but left for Erumeli, around 30 km away. The Kerala government had on Friday claimed that 51 women between the ages of 10 and 50 had entered the Sabarimala temple since the Supreme Court's verdict, which allowed women of reproductive age to enter the shrine. A list of names, along with their age and Aadhaar details were given to the Supreme Court. However, many women who were featured on the list say the Kerala government's claim is not entirely correct. A 42-year old woman mentioned in the list turned out to be a man from Tamil Nadu. Many others on the list have said that they are 50 and above, blaming incorrect information on their Aadhaar cards. NDTV called up over 15 women from the list after their details were leaked soon after a Supreme Court hearing on Friday. Chandira from Tamil Nadu was mentioned in the list as a 48-year-old. However, her voter ID card shows she was born in 1956, making her 63. Padmavathy from Andhra Pradesh was shown as 48 on the list, but when contacted, she said she was 55. The entry of two women earlier triggered widespread protests in the state with a day-long strike by right-wing groups, which also saw backing from BJP and Congress workers. The Sabarimala temple has been the site of controversy ever since the Supreme Court ruling on September 28. The court order allowing women of reproductive age to enter the shrine has not been accepted by devotees and protestors, who feel the women should not be allowed near the shrine.

The funds for public institutions have been cut drastically over the years and the premier public funded institutions such as JNU have even stopped subscribing important academic journals by citing the scarcity of fund, a statement from the student bodies said. ""The central government has given green signal to start Self-financing courses in public universities and colleges, in the name of autonomy. On the one side seats have been reduced in higher education institutions while on the other there is a complete dismantling of reservation,"" it added. ""The federal character of Indian education is under severe attack, with initiating central policies without taking the peculiarities of each state and their representation in decision making into cognizance,"" they said. According to the organisers, students will be mobilised from across the nation for a massive student march to parliament on February 18. ""There will be an intensive campaign throughout the country highlighting the issues of education as part of this 'Delhi Chalo' call by the left student organisations. Conventions and seminars will be held in all states rallying all democratic and secular sections,"" the statement said. The central demands of the march are: - Establish a nation-wide fully state-funded and free Common Education System from KG to PG. - Increase government spending to at least 6% of the GDP and 10% of the central budget on education. - Enact Bhagat Singh National Employment Guarantee Act (BNEGA) to ensure guaranteed employment to all. - Stop communalization of education. - Implement existing reservations properly and ensure social justice in govt as well as private institutions. - Release the money for all pending scholarships immediately and establish more fellowships for research scholars from deprived backgrounds. - Protect federal character of education and resist centralization of education. The protests have been planned under the banner of student bodies; SFI, AISF, AIDSO, AISB and PSU.

Shah Faesal, who resigned from the administrative services in protest against the centre's policies on Kashmir, sparked controversy by saying that little had been done to solve the problems of the state. Mr Abdullah today said that should Mr Faesal choose to join the National Conference, he could arrange for that to happen. ""Shah Faesal is free to choose, he can go wherever he wants to. If he wants to join the National Conference, I can definitely get that arranged,"" Mr Abdullah told the media in Jammu and Kashmir capital Srinagar, according to news agency ANI. Sources close to Mr Faesal said he would enter politics and would contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from North Kashmir's Baramulla constituency. His social media posts, announcing his resignation, were also seen as strong indicators of his reported intention to join politics. ""To protest against the unabated killings in Kashmir and lack of any sincere reach-out from the Union government; the marginalization and invisiblisation of around 200 million Indian Muslims at the hands of Hindutva forces reducing them to second-class citizens; insidious attacks on the special identity of the J&K state and growing culture of intolerance and hate in the mainland India in the name of hyper-nationalism, I have decided to resign from IAS,"" Mr Faesal said in a Facebook post. Mr Faesal has so far remained silent as to which party he would join. However, he ruled out joining the Hurriyat Conference, saying he was ""a man from the system"" and that he rejected the notion of the Hurriyat Conference to ""not subscribe to electoral politics,"" according to news agency IANS. ""He left the service to serve the people, he has to decide in what role he can do that in the best way possible,"" Mr Abdullah said. Mr Faesal topped the IAS exam in 2010 and was given his home cadre of Jammu and Kashmir. Over the years, he worked as District Magistrate, Director of School Education and Managing Director of the state-owned Power Development Corporation. Shah Faesal recently returned from the US after completing his Fulbright fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School.

The students, who came out in large numbers, said this was not the first time Kanak Sarkar has made misogynistic and regressive comments. Mr Sarkar, a professor at the university's Department of International Relations, had written in a Facebook post that, ""Virgin girl is like sealed bottle or sealed packet. Are you willing to buy broken seal while purchasing a bottle of cold drinks or a packet of biscuits...To most boys' virgin wife is like angel."" Mr Sarkar who has now deleted his Facebook account, stood by his statement and said the constitution guaranteed him the freedom of speech and expression. The comments were intended for ""fun"" among social media friends and ""not for public consumption"", news agency Press Trust of India had quoted him as saying. On Monday, a journalist said that Mr Sarkar had once asked a female student if she wants to become a model as her ""figure"" is ""very model-like"" and hers was the kind of body that ""men would enjoy"". Students said that this should be the last time he is allowed to make such comments as a professor of the university. Vice-Chancellor Suranjan Das, who was not on campus today, has assured action. Professor Omprakash Mishra said that they have set up student-teacher committee to probe the incident. ""The comments by Kanak Sarkar are highly condemnable. I am surprised how a teacher can make such comments. Professor Sarkar's Department of International Relations has set up committee. If the committee reports any misconduct by him, I will take necessary steps immediately according to rules,"" he told NDTV. Rekha Sharma, the chairperson of the National Commission for Women, will meet the vice chancellor on Friday. In a letter addressed to the vice chancellor, they have asked for Mr Sarkar to depose before the Commission within 7 days. Professor Omprakash Mishra, Head of the Department of International Relations, said the behavior of the professor in classrooms is to be evaluated and some action is expected by tomorrow afternoon.

The women were surrounded by a large number of protesters around 1 km after they crossed the base camp. The women were taken to safety by the police in a vehicle. They had earlier refused to return without offering prayers, saying they followed the 41-day penance. The two women are part of a nine-member group who were on their way to the temple. The group was stopped after they crossed the Pamba base camp. One of the women, Reshma Nishant, claimed she has been getting death threats ever since she began her penance. ""If they're trying to scare me away, I am definitely not ready to go back,"" she told reporters. ""There is Ayyappan there. Ayyappan has no objection to women entering the temple. Why are these people protesting then?"" she said. Activist Rahul Easwaran tweeted, backing the protesters who stopped the women who tried to ""intrude into #Sabarimala"". 1 more Victory for #Hindu Resistance Huge protests erupt for #SaveSabarimala .. some leftists with 2 young women tried to intrude into #Sabarimala Devotees from different states spontaneously gather and resist the young women, leftist group and police Young women returned On Monday, Kanaka Durga, one of the first women below 50 to enter the temple, was attacked at home allegedly by her mother-in-law. She had entered her home after nearly two weeks in hiding because of threats by right-wing protesters. She alleged that her mother-in-law came at her with a wooden stick and beat her until she could barely stand. Then she was thrown out. Kanaka Durga, along with 40-year-old Bindu Ammini, are the first women below 50 in decades to enter the hilltop shrine . For nearly two weeks, they stayed in an undisclosed location on the outskirts of Kochi, under state protection. The temple has been the site of tension since the Supreme Court ruled in September last year to end the age restriction on women. The court order has not been accepted by the devotees and protesters who believe women should not be allowed near the shrine's deity, Lord Ayyappa. Since the court order, attempts by women to visit the shrine were blocked by thousands of protesters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was in Kerala on Monday, attacked the Left government in the state over the handling of the Sabarimala temple issue. ""The CPM government's conduct on Sabarimala will go down in history as the most shameful action of any government in power... We know CPM government never respected spirituality, religion... but no one thought it would turn so shameful ,"" PM Modi said in Kollam. The CPM hit back with a tweet, calling PM Modi's comments ""shameful"". ""(PM) Modi should read the Indian constitution which he is sworn to uphold rather than Manusmriti or RSS oath!"" the party tweeted from its official handle.

Would the same dreadful fate befall the writers, particularly, Manto in ""Naya Pakistan""?"" Saadat Hasan Manto was tried for obscenity six times - three times before 1947 in British India, and thrice in Pakistan. However, he was never convicted. The film also explores Manto's trials through and the fight he put up to defend freedom of expression. Manto premiered worldwide at the Cannes Film Festival 2018 and the film opened in Indian screens in September 2018.

Macron's initiative comes after nine weeks of protests by the ""yellow vests"" -- named after the high-visibility jackets they wear. The disparate anti-government uprising has wreaked havoc in Paris and French cities, shaken the economy and challenged his authority. ""For me, there is no banned issue. We won't agree on everything, which is normal in a democracy. But at least we'll show we're a people which is not afraid of talking, exchanging, debating,"" Macron wrote in the letter published by his office. But Macron said he would remain faithful to his campaign manifesto, and appeared to rule out rolling back some of the pro-business economic reforms, such as scrapping a wealth tax, which have earned him the nickname ""president of the rich"". ""When taxes are too high, our economy is starved of the resources that could be usefully invested in companies, creating jobs and growth,"" Macron wrote. ""We will not undo the measures we have introduced to put this right, encourage investment and ensure that work pays more."" In the 2,330-word letter, to be published in French newspapers, he also asked a series of questions he hoped the French will answer in town hall meetings across the country or in online questionnaires. Below are some of the questions Macron asked: - Which taxes do you think we should cut? - What kind of public spending savings do you think we should make a priority? - Are there too many administrative layers? - Should we use referendums more often and who should be able to trigger them? Macron said proposals made during the debate will help build a new ""contract for the nation"" and influence government policy-making and France's stance on European and international issues. He said he would give his own conclusions within a month of the end of the debate on March 15, but did not mention a possible referendum on his policies, an idea floated privately by some in his administration.

Rahul Gandhi Edits View On Sabarimala To An Election-Friendly Version,Rahul Gandhi Edits View On Sabarimala To An Election-Friendly Version,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhis-changed-position-on-sabarimala-accommodates-tradition-1977041,en,"After over three months of continued protests , opposing the entry of women of reproductive age into Kerala's Sabarimala temple, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has tweaked his position on the issue. Mr Gandhi, who earlier spoke in favour of allowing women of all ages into Sabarimala, today said he also sees merit in the argument of traditionalists, who are upholding the traditional ban. ""I can see validity in the argument that tradition needs to be protected... and that women should have equal rights,"" Rahul Gandhi said at an interaction with the media in Dubai. Admitting to the change in his stance, Mr Gandhi said he would not ""be able to give an open and shut position on this"". The acknowledgment of the traditionalists' argument comes weeks after the election victories in the three heartland states, where the Congress had worn its religion on its sleeve. Mr Gandhi had temple hopped regularly and in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath, who is now the Chief Minister, had spoken of cow protection and religious tours. Mr Gandhi's new position closes the gap between the party's central leadership and the state unit on the issue. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy's government had supported the traditional sentiment and now that the party is in the opposition, it has not changed its views. Mr Gandhi, who initially explained the gap saying the state unit ""represents the emotions of the people of Kerala"", now said he has come to realise the ""complications"". ""After I spoke to the people in Kerala, and our team there, I realised that the issue is much more complicated and both sides have a valid position. I would leave it to people to decide on this,"" he told journalists in Dubai on Saturday. The top court's September judgment that opened the doors of Sabarimala to women of all ages had called the traditional ban ""almost like untouchability"". Since then, right-wing groups had practically been picketing at the temple, harassing and threatening women and forcing them to turn away. Earlier this month, two women in their 40s finally made their way into the temple . Another woman, a Sri Lankan, also managed to offer prayers. Attacked by parties like the BJP and the Congress, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan says he is duty-bound to follow the Supreme Court order.

Mobile phones of the first-time MLAs have been ""kept aside"" to safeguard them against any poaching attempt, the sources said, reported news agency Press Trust of India. A political crisis in brewing in Karnataka, where two Independent MLAs on Tuesday had withdrawn support to the seven-month-old ministry amid trading of poaching charges by the ruling coalition and BJP. Union minister DV Sadananda Gowda had said on Tuesday that the BJP would stake claim to power in Karnataka if the Congress-JDS coalition government falls. Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy however reiterated he enjoyed the support of 120 MLAs and alleged that Yeddyurappa was making ""futile attempts"" to destabilise his government. In the 224-member Karnataka Assembly, BJP has 104 members, Congress-79, JDS 37, BSP, KPJP and Independent one each, besides the Speaker.

She also threatened to stage a dharna at the office of his Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). Mr Paswan, whose party will contest the upcoming general election along with JD(U) and BJP in Bihar, had at a press conference on Friday attacked the opposition RJD for opposing the NDA-led government's bill to provide 10 per cent reservation for the economically backward in general category. ""They (RJD) believe in merely raising slogans and making '' angootha chhap '' (illiterate person) the chief minister,"" he had said, without naming anybody. The remark was seen as a reference to the events of 1997 when RJD chief Lalu Prasad had to step down as Bihar chief minister as he faced arrest in the fodder scam cases and his wife, Rabri Devi, who has little formal education, was appointed as his successor. She remained in office for eight years, longer than her husband, who was in power from 1990 to 1997. ""Papa has insulted Rabri Devi. My mother too was uneducated - a reason why he abandoned her. He must apologise or else I will stage a dharna in front of the LJP office,"" Asha said. She is Mr Paswan's daughter from his first marriage. Her husband, Arun Sadhu, had joined the RJD last year.

A senior student has been arrested in the incident after locals launched protests, alleging a cover-up attempt. The 14-year-old girl, a student of Class 8, delivered the baby on Saturday night, Kandhamal District Welfare Officer (DWO), Charulata Mallick said. The girl said that she and the baby were thrown out of the hostel and had to seek shelter in a nearby forest. The school in Kandhamal district is run by the tribal and rural development department of Odisha. With the government facing sharp criticism from the opposition over the incident, Odisha minister Ramesh Majhi said the district collector had been asked to probe the incident and submit a detailed report on the circumstances under which the girl got pregnant and delivered the baby. ""The government has taken a serious view of the incident,"" he said in Bhubaneswar. Ms Mallick said a third year student has been arrested over the incident. District Collector D Brunda said two matrons, two cook-cum-attendants, a lady supervisor and an auxiliary midwife of the institute were suspended. The government has also recommended suspending the school headmistress Radha Rani Dalei on the same charges, Mr Brunda said. The two were traced by authorities from nearby forest and the local police on Sunday morning and taken to hospital. The police were informed by the locals, who also staged a demonstration and put up a blockade on National Highway 59 demanding immediate arrest of the accused and stern action against the school authorities.

France's ''Yellow Vests'' Mobilise For Fresh Round Of Protests,France's ''Yellow Vests'' Mobilise For Fresh Round Of Protests,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/frances-yellow-vests-mobilise-for-fresh-round-of-protests-1976832,en,"Thousands of anti-government demonstrators marched in cities across France on Saturday in a new round of ""yellow vest"" protests against President Emmanuel Macron, accused of ignoring the plight of millions of people struggling to make ends meet. Officials have vowed zero tolerance for the violence that has marred the weekly protests since they began two months ago, deploying some 80,000 security forces nationwide. In Paris, epicentre of the fiery street clashes and vandalism that have made global headlines, 5,000 riot police were on hand, using tall barricades and armoured vehicles to lock down the central Place de la Concorde and surrounding districts. Hundreds of officers were also on guard on the Champs-Elysees, where banks, jewellery stores and other shops had boarded up windows in anticipation of renewed looting and violence. Yet many cafes and retailers on the iconic avenue remained open for business, as several thousands of protesters marched calmly from the Place de la Bastille toward the Arc de Triomphe early in the afternoon. Many sang the ""Marseillaise"" national anthem, while others held signs saying ""Insecurity is not a job!"" At times the crowd yelled ""Free Christophe!"" in reference to Christophe Dettinger, the former professional boxer arrested last week after being filmed bashing two police officers during the Paris demos. Police said some 30 people had been detained in the capital earlier for carrying weapons or other charges. ""We've come to Paris to make ourselves heard, and we wanted to see for ourselves at least once what's going on here,"" said Patrick, 37, who told AFP he had travelled from the Savoie region of western France. 'Macron resign!' In the well-heeled racehorsing town of Chantilly just north of Paris, 1,000 or so protesters marched through the centre before descending on the hippodrome where they delayed the start of a race, local media said. And another 1,200 protesters gathered in the central city of Bourges, where some yellow-vest organisers were hoping to those from areas far from the capital. Signs said ""Macron resign!"" and ""France is angry,"" while local prosecutor Joel Garrigue said five people had been detained after police discovered a cache of ball bearings during a search of their car. The protests also spilt over the border into eastern Belgium late on Friday, where one of around 25 protesters manning a blockade died after being hit by a truck, Belgian media reported. Mutual mistrust Officials had warned of bigger and more violent protests than last week, when demonstrators rammed a forklift truck through the main doors of a government ministry in Paris. ""Those who are calling to demonstrate tomorrow know there will be violence, and therefore they are in part responsible,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said in a Facebook interview Friday with Brut, a digital news site favoured by many yellow vests. But many yellow vests pointed to images of a police officer repeatedly striking an unarmed man on the ground during a protest last week in Toulon, accusing the police of excessive use of force. The movement, which began as protests over high fuel taxes, has snowballed into a wholesale rejection of Macron and his policies, which are seen favouring the wealthy at the expense of rural and small-town France. Politicians inspire 'distrust, disgust' Macron has called for a national debate starting next week to hear voters' grievances, hoping to sate demands for more of a say in national law-making and tamp down the protesters' anger. He has already unveiled a 10-billion-euro ($11.5 billion) financial relief package for low earners, and axed the planned fuel tax hike. But the public consultations risk being hobbled by record levels of distrust towards politicians and representatives of the state. A poll by the Cevipof political sciences institute released Friday showed 77 percent of respondents thought politicians inspired ""distrust"", ""disgust"" or ""boredom"". And Macron may not have done himself any favours on Friday, when he told a gathering at the Elysee Palace that ""too many of our citizens think they can get something without making the necessary effort.""

Tribal groups are also protesting police firing earlier this week, in which six youth were injured. Parties led by BJP ally, Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura (INPT), demanded the resignation Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb. They want a judicial probe headed by a sitting High Court judge, compensation of Rs 20 lakh or government jobs for the families of the injured youth. ""The BJP-led government's police opened fire on unarmed innocent people while they were protesting against the Bill on Tuesday, in a democratic manner. We have called for a bandh to protest the firing,"" INPT General Secretary Jagadhish Debbarma told reporters in Agartala. Security measures have been intensified and large contingents of the Tripura State Rifles, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Assam Rifles and Tripura Police have been deployed across the tribal dominated areas police sources have told NDTV. Mobile data and Internet services are still suspended in the state to check spreading of rumours on social media. Six leaders of the North-East Students Organisation (NESO), who had called the bandh in the entire northeastern region on Tuesday, were not allowed to go to the troubled areas of Khumulwng, where protesters had clashed with the police injuring six people. ""The BJP-led Tripura government does not believe in democratic values. The party is trying to bulldoze sentiments and opinion of the people of the northeast. The BJP is using force on people of the northeast, who voted for them and the police firing is an example of that. We will fight this and not allow the bill to be implemented,"" said NESO adviser, Samujjal Bhattacharjee. Alleging conspiracy, Tripura BJP spokesperson, Nabendu Bhattacharjee, said that the tribal parties, who called the bandh , ""have no base among the masses"" and these parties and the CPI-M are ""conspiring against the state government"". The Congress party, however, is supporting the bandh in Tripura. The BJP-led Manipur government too has sought exemption from citizenship bill as agitators hit the streets on Friday. Three persons, including a woman and a police officer, were injured in clashes between students, women vendors and the police at the Khwairamban Bazaar, the main market in Imphal. The police had to fire teargas shells to disperse the protesters. Many NDA partners in the northeast including the Asom Gana Parishad in Assam, the ruling Mizo National Front in Mizoram, the NPP heading a coalition government with the BJP in Meghalaya, the IPFT, and the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party, heading a coalition with the BJP in Nagaland have already said that they are not in agreement with the BJP over the bill. The AGP has even quit the alliance. Amid strong opposition by political parties like the Congress, Left and the Trinamool Congress, the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016, which seeks to grant citizenship to migrants from six non-Muslim minority groups from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

""Stop the shutdown!"" protesters shouted in the bitter cold at the union-organized demonstration that started at the AFL-CIO headquarters and ended in front of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where they hoisted signs reading ""Trump: End the Shutdown"" and ""Not a strike - we want to work."" Some 800,000 federal government employees have been ordered to stay home or work without pay during the shutdown brought on by a standoff between Trump and Democrats in Congress over Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall on the southern U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, in a 2016 presidential campaign promise, repeatedly vowed that Mexico would pay for the wall. But he has said he will not sign any bill to reopen the government that does not provide wall funding. Elaine Suriano, 62, a furloughed scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency, said she would have to dip into her retirement savings if the shutdown continued and robbed her of yet another paycheck. ""It's just clear that this administration doesn't understand normal people and real life or they wouldn't do this,"" Suriano said. In its third week, the shutdown of about a quarter of the federal government is the second longest since the mid-1970s. Trump has said it could continue for months or even years. Many furloughed federal workers have turned to online fundraising outlets such as GoFundMe.com to help cover expenses from food to utility bills. Mathew Crichton, 32, a furloughed Peace Corps employee, said uncertainty over how long the shutdown will last made it impossible to budget for food, lodging and other needs. ""It could go on another day, and it could go on more weeks. It could go on for months,"" Crichton said. ""It's really a shame that I'm ready to go to work. I'm able to go to work and I can't."" Protesters, many wearing neon green vests reading, ""I am a worker. I demand a voice,"" on Thursday demanded the government be reopened, separate from any debate over wall funding. Smaller protests across the country - from Palm Beach, Florida, to New York City - had similar demands. In Ogden, Utah, dozens of out-of-work federal employees gathered to urge an end to the shutdown, some holding signs reading ""I am TSA. I am furloughed. I am not a pawn. I'm a voter"" and ""800,000 unemployed. Hurts our family and our economy."" Trump was not at the White House when the protesters arrived, having traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border in McAllen, Texas. The president has said he has the right to declare a national emergency if no deal with Congress can be reached on funding the border wall project.

District Superintendent of Police Sylvester Nongtynger said while there were no injuries to any personnel when the bus was targeted on Thursday night on the National Highway in the Khasi-Jaintia Hills region, the vehicle was partially damaged. Protests have been reported from several places in the northeast region against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill that seeks to accord Indian citizenship on non-Muslims from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. On Thursday night, a group of 14 Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) sponsored a night blockade on highways and hence traffic movement on the National Highway was disrupted, police said. The police escorted the vehicle after the attack, they said. On Friday too, several groups of citizens staged protest against the Bill and burnt effigies depicting the proposed legislation and the BJP. As many as 15 miners are trapped for almost a month inside the illegal coal mine filled with water in Meghalaya. Even as a multi-agency effort to rescue them is underway, the Supreme Court is hearing a PIL in the matter for urgent action. The centre on Friday told the Supreme Court it has to ""believe in miracles"" and see if the miners come out alive. The court told the Centre's counsel, ""There is no dispute that you are making efforts. Whether they (miners) are alive today, we do not know. May be somebody is alive there. You have to take them out."" A senior police officer in Meghalaya said the flow of traffic along the national highways was affected and there were reports of stone throwing on vehicles in West Khasi Hills, East Jaintia Hills and in Ri-Bhoi districts as well. Some groups in the Garo Hills region continued their protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill by observing a black flag day across the region.

Viral Video Shows Tripura Police Attacking Ambulance Carrying Injured Men Amid Protests,Viral Video Shows Tripura Police Attacking Ambulance Carrying Injured Men Amid Protests,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tripura-police-attack-ambulance-carrying-injured-duo-amid-protests-1976794,en,"Shocking videos of Tripura policemen allegedly attacking an ambulance carrying two injured protesters to a hospital went viral on social media earlier this week, giving credence to allegations of a brutal crackdown against those opposing the central government's Citizenship (Amendment) Bill-2016 in the state. The people inside the vehicle, who were apparently wounded in police firing, could be seen crying for mercy. The first video of the incident that occurred on January 8 shows a Tripura State Rifles team stopping an ambulance transporting the two bullet-hit protesters to a hospital outside Khumulwng in the western part of the state. The next shot has them beating up the driver, who runs from the spot as the injured shriek in agony. The policemen, clad in anti-riot helmets and vests, can be seen hitting the vehicle with batons while one smashes its windscreen. The second clip, an apparent follow-up of the first shot, bears visuals of the two injured men lying inside the wrecked ambulance. The police have denied the incident. ""I cannot comment on the video because I haven't watched it. All I can say is that the police were the ones who took the injured to hospital. We don't attack ambulances,"" Additional Director General of Police Rajiv Singh said over the phone from Agartala. The brutal incident followed the injury of six tribal youngsters in police firing during a protest by the North East Students' Organisation against the controversial bill. The authorities said police and paramilitary personnel had no choice but to lathi-charge and fire in the air to disperse the protesters. The injured included a Tripura State Rifles personnel and six Twipra Students Federation members who were part of a group that blocked the Assam-Agartala National Highway in Madhabbari. The incident was condemned by the opposition and allies of the BJP alike, with an NDA partner -- the Indigenous Nationalist Part of Tripura (INPT) -- even demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb . They have also sought a judicial probe headed by a sitting High Court judge, and compensation of Rs 20 lakh as well as government jobs for families of the injured. ""Police personnel under the BJP-led government opened fire on unarmed innocents while they were protesting against the bill in a democratic manner on Tuesday,"" INPT general secretary Jagadhish Debbarma told reporters in Agartala, calling for a 12-hour shutdown on Saturday. Tripura BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharjee dismissed the allegations, claiming that the tribal parties responsible for the shutdown ""have no base among the masses"". He also alleged that these organisations were ""conspiring against the state government"" in connivance with the Left parties. The Lok Sabha had passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 -- which seeks to grant speedy citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from three neighbouring states -- on January 8 amid strong protests by political parties such as the Congress and the Trinamool Congress. The opposition terms the legislation as discriminatory. Get the latest election news , live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

""I have ruled out all mainstream political parties at the moment. My idea is not to grab a chair or win an election. What I want to do now is engage people, talk to youngsters, see what are their aspirations, see how we can better represent them,"" he told NDTV in an exclusive interview. Mr Faesal, however, clarified that he does plan to enter politics in the long run. ""Parliament is definitely a place I am looking at, and I hope all existing political parties pitch in. While I have my idea of reimagining politics, other stakeholders can also be brought in,"" he said. The IAS topper had announced his decision to quit the IAS in a Facebook post, stating that it was in protest against the ""unabated killings"" in Kashmir and the ""marginalisation of Indian Muslims"". Media reports had then claimed that he was likely to join former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's National Conference. ""I will always be a proud former member of the service, but the right to life of the Kashmiri youth should be respected. I am doing this to protest the denial of justice to my fellow-Kashmiris and the lack of political initiative in the state,"" he said. ""I will be very happy to fight the next parliament elections,"" he said. "" I will listen to youngsters and meet stakeholders."" The former civil services official criticised the BJP government's alleged attack on the state's ""special position and identity"", and said that it was indulging in such activities for electoral gains in the rest of the country. ""The rise in lynch mob nationalism in our country dejects me. Also, attempts are being made to pit one region of the state against another,"" he said. Mr Faesal cracked the Union Public Service Commission examinations in 2010, but kept a low profile in the years that followed. During the 2016 Kashmir unrest, he asked media organisations to stop contrasting him with Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani. However, the former IAS topper doesn't believe that his decision will discourage youngsters from taking up the civil services. ""They should know that I am not leaving this job out of frustration... this was about leaving something that's very dear. This gives me a sense of giving up, of sacrifice, it's a very painful moment for me. But I had nothing else to give up that would bring the government's attention to all the killings happening in Kashmir,"" he said. During a press meet held in Srinagar today, he had accused the Narendra Modi government of promoting the ""culture of intolerance"" while placing curbs on free speech and undermining central institutions such as the Central Bureau of Investigation.  ""Earlier, I was not allowed to speak on these issues due to the civil services rules of conduct. Today, I am relieved at being allowed to do so,"" Mr Faesal said, adding that he was expecting support from youngsters across the state. The former IAS officer said he is inspired by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in politics, but  the situation is completedly different in Kashmir.  He also slammed the central government for failing to ensure the homecoming of Kashmir Pandits, stating that the state is ""incomplete"" without the exiled community.

The temple has been the site of tension since the Supreme Court ruled in late September to end a ban on women of menstruating age entering it. There have since been sporadic outbreaks of violence between the authorities and protesters attempting to prevent women from entering. Bindu Ammini, 40, a law lecturer at Kerala's Kannur University and Kanaka Durga, 39, a civil servant, told Reuters they were determined to enter despite threats of violence. ""A lot of people tried to dissuade us and make us turn back - police officers, our friends... because they knew we were facing a lot of backlash,"" Kanakadurga said. After the Supreme Court's judgment, the women made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the temple on December 24, before finally succeeding on January 2. A third woman aged 46 has since entered the site, the office of the chief minister of Kerala said on January 4. ""We felt no fear. We had only one aim: we wanted to go to that shrine,"" Bindu said. Their entry sparked widespread protests and a day-long strike in Kerala led in part by members of ruling BJP. ""This BJP government has a duty to regulate and control their members,"" Bindu said. The women -- speaking in an undisclosed location on the outskirts of Kochi -- say they have since faced threats from protesters, but that they trusted the authorities to keep them safe and plan to return home next week.

The BJP had fielded its lawmaker Jagdish Devda for the post. Earlier, assembly speaker NP Prajapati read out four separate proposals of treasury benches to elect the two-time legislator Ms Kawre, 33, as deputy speaker. Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava objected to this, saying his party's proposal to elect Mr Devda should be read out too along with the four proposals. The Chair agreed to this. Former assembly speaker Sitasharan Sharma also tried to raise a point of order (objection to the procedure being adopted to elect deputy speaker) on the issue. Mr Bhargava and former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan backed Mr Sharma and demanded that the former speaker be heard. After speaker Prajapati did not pay heed to the opposition's demand, BJP members said the House was being run ""un-democratically and unilaterally"" right from day one. The BJP legislators trooped into the Well of the House and shouted slogans seeking that Mr Sharma, one of their senior most members, be given a chance to speak. The speaker, however, said he had honoured Mr Bhargava's demand and read out the five proposals. He asked the opposition not to hinder the process to elect the deputy speaker. The speaker had to adjourn the House two times for 10 minutes each amid protests. After the House reassembled, Ms Kawre was elected deputy speaker by a voice vote amid pandemonium. The BJP lawmakers continued to stay put in the Well of the House, leading Mr Prajapati to adjourn the House for the third time for 10 minutes. When the House reassembled, the BJP shouted slogans against the speaker and accused him of being ""unfair"". The opposition members said the deputy speaker was elected without following established rules and maintained there was no point in Mr Prajapati now giving a clarification. Mr Prajapati took up the listed business for the day, including approving the supplementary budget. The speaker then adjourned the House sine die a day ahead of schedule.

The bill, passed by the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, aims to grant citizenship rights to non-Muslim migrants from three neighbouring countries. The three -- Dr Hiren Gohain, Akhil Gogoi and Manjit Mahanta -- are spearheading the protests in Guwahati. According to sources, the Latashil police registered an FIR against Mr Gohail for allegedly making controversial statements against the government at a public meeting in Guwahati earlier this week. The other leaders were accused of raising the idea of a sovereign Assam -- in keeping with the views of terrorist group ULFA -- at rallies covered by the media. Meanwhile, protests continued in the Northeast for the second day after the Lok Sabha passed the controversial legislation. Roads were blocked in front of the state secretariat in Guwahati, and BJP leaders were shown black flags wherever they went. Members of 70 civil society groups spearheaded a non-violent agitation, resolving that PM Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah and other party leaders will not be allowed to enter Assam for poll campaigning until the controversial bill is withdrawn. Mr Gogoi led hundreds of protesters in shouting slogans against the BJP government at the state secretariat, Dispur. Orders prohibiting public gatherings were imposed across Guwahati in view of the ongoing agitation. Even the BJP's regional allies are miffed. While the Asom Gana Parishad has parted ways with the ruling party in Assam, National People's Party chief Conrad Sangma is considering following suit. Sensing trouble brewing in the region, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached out with the assurance that his party means well. The 25 Lok Sabha seats in the northeast are crucial for the BJP's electoral prospects in the upcoming parliamentary polls. ""After this was passed... children of Ma Bharat, those who sing Vande Mataram from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh can now become citizens of India easily.

But Sister Kalapura did not turn up, saying that she was busy. ""Your deeds on September 20 and the following dates caused grave external scandal and harm to the church... On 20th, you went to the Ernakulam High Court junction and participated in the protest held by the SoS (Save our Sisters) council without the permission of your superior... Through Facebook, channel discussions and articles, you belittled the Catholic leadership by making false accusations against it and tried to bring down the sacraments... you defamed the congregation and your performance through social media was culpable in causing grave scandal,"" the note read.

For publishing your book, you have used Rs 50,000. That was a very high amount that exceeds the amount even a superior general can use for extraordinary expenses,"" it read. Although the provincial superior had denied Sister Lucy permission to publish her collection of poems titled ""Snehamazhayil"", she had gone ahead with it anyway. The congregation also termed the act of participating in television news channels and writing articles in non-Christian newspapers on the Bishop Mulakkal case as a ""grave scandal"".

The Kashmiri IAS topper of 2010 had resigned on Wednesday saying he was quitting to protest against ""unabated killings"" in Kashmir and the ""marginalization of Indian Muslims"". Today, Mr Chidambaram in a series of tweets said the world will take note of Mr Faesal's ""cry of anguish and defiance"". Calling his resignation an ""indictment of the BJP government"", the former home and finance minister said Shah Faesal's ""every word of  statement was true."" Mr Chidambaram also tweeted about another police officer who ""said the same thing"" as Shah Faesal and attacked the BJP ""rulers"" for not giving any reassurance. Not long ago Mr Rebeiro, the legendary police officer, said the same thing, but there was not a word of reassurance from the Rulers. Such statements from our fellow citizens must make us hang our heads in regret and shame. Shah Faesal had released a statement on his resignation from the civil services yesterday on Facebook. He wrote: ""To protest against the unabated killings in Kashmir and lack of any sincere reach-out from the Union government; the marginalization and invisiblisation of around 200 million Indian Muslims at the hands of Hindutva forces reducing them to second-class citizens; insidious attacks on the special identity of the J&K state and growing culture of intolerance and hate in the mainland India in the name of hyper-nationalism, I have decided to resign from IAS."" His Facebook post was seen as a strong indicator that he intends to join politics. Many reports have suggested he will join the National Conference. Sources close to him say he may contest the parliament elections from Baramulla constituency in North Kashmir. A tweet from National Conference chief Omar Abdullah reinforced speculation when he ""welcomed Shah Faesal to the fold"". But Mr Abdullah later clarified: ""Actually I welcomed him to the fold of politicians. His future political plans are his to announce."" Shah Faesal reportedly gave a resignation notice to the state government on Monday. He topped the IAS or Indian Administrative Service exam in 2010 and was allotted the home cadre of Jammu and Kashmir.

Quota Bill Brings Out Rifts Among the Opposition Parties,Quota Bill Brings Out Rifts Among the Opposition Parties,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/quota-bill-brings-out-rifts-among-the-opposition-parties-1975399,en,"The proposed law to provide for 10 per cent quota for the economically weaker sections in the general category, introduced and passed by both houses of parliament within two days, is a record of sorts in recent times, when parliament has been logjammed for days by protesting opposition parties. While many of the parties, including the Congress, questioned the government's haste in introducing and clearing the bill , they found their hands forced. Most of the opposition parties, as Union minister Arun Jaitley had pointed out during the debate in Lok Sabha, have supported quota on basis of income at some point. The Congress-led UPA government in 2013 had even come up with the idea which the NDA government implemented. Where they differed was in the mode of the implementation. Others raised the question of rights of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and the Other Backward Classes, contending that they deserved a share of reservations bigger than 50 per cent. The matter brought out the many rifts among the opposition parties, which are trying to paper over their differences to present a united front against the BJP ahead of the coming national elections. The Congress and several other parties, including Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Left parties and Tamil Nadu's opposition DMK pointed out that the bill required intense scrutiny, especially as it exceeds the 50 per cent cap on quota prescribed by the Supreme Court and could be subjected to questioning. Even the Trinamool Congress, which extended cautious support to the bill, expressed reservations. Party leader Derek O Brien said, ""This bill is an acknowledgement of guilt about not creating enough jobs... It also redefines India's poverty line,"" he added. The parties wanted a select committee to examine the bill - a demand that was shot down during voting. Other parties flagged the interest of the support base. Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal argued that if 10 per cent quota is being set aside for the 15 per cent upper castes, there should be 90 per cent reservation for the remaining 85 per cent population. Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, the two Uttar Pradesh leaders whose supporters comprise largely of Dalits and Other Backward Classes, also demanded a bigger share of the pie for these communities. But neither was read to pull off support to the bill for fear of upsetting the rest of the electorate, or support a scrutiny which would have put the bill on ice. Telangana's ruling party, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, called for a 12 per cent reservation for backward Muslims and Union minister Ram Das Athwale, the chief of the Republican Party of India said the government should increase the 27 per cent quota for the Other Backward Castes by at least 10 per cent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi insisted the bill does not ""steal"" from the Dalits and Backward castes. ""I used to say earlier that going above 50 per cent reservation was simply not possible without a constitutional amendment. Anyone who promised anything else was lying or would steal from the Dalits , SC and ST reservations. I am very happy that I have managed to do this without stealing from the Dalits or Adivasis,"" he said.

Agriculture Minister Atul Bora, Water Resources Minister Keshav Mahanta and Food and Civil Supplies Minister Phanibhushan Choudhury submitted their resignations to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal at the state secretariat in Assam capital Guwahati, Mr Bora told reporters after submitting their resignations. The AGP had pulled out of the BJP-led coalition government a day before the bill seeking to provide Indian citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan was passed in Lok Sabha on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, the AGP executive met at the party headquarters in Guwahati to discuss the resignations and the future course of action. Mr Bora, who is also the party president, told reporters after the meeting that he would announce the party's future strategy regarding the bill after submitting their resignations. The AGP pulled out of the state government after its ""last-ditch attempt to convince"" the centre to withdrew the proposed legislation failed on Monday. The withdrawal of the AGP, which has 14 MLAs in the 126-member assembly, will not have any immediate effect on the future of the Sarbananda Sonowal-led government that still has the backing of 74 MLAs. The BJP has 61 members and the party has support of 12 MLAs of the Bodoland People's Front and the sole Independent member.

The 10 central trade unions (CTUs) which have given a call for the two-day Bharat Bandh are protesting the government's snub of their 12-point charter of demands seeking minimum wage of Rs 18,000, social security for all workers and issue related to price rise. The workers participating in the strike will go on a protest march from Mandi House to Parliament on Wednesday at noon, and similarly protests would be seen in other parts of the country as well. All India Trade Union Congress General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur told PTI that there will be a complete bandh in Goa and Bihar, while 100 per cent strike is expected in other parts of the country too. She said that due to UGC exams, which started from Tuesday, some state transport departments would not participate completely in the strike in the interest of students. The exams are scheduled in some states on Wednesday as well. The strike had received mixed response on Tuesday. The educational institutes, rail, banking, postal and transport services are expected to witness disruption on Wednesday too. The unions have alleged that the government has failed to create jobs and grossly ignored unions' 12-point charter of demands. They also said that the Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on labour issues has not called unions for any discussion since September 2, 2015, strike which left them with no other option but to go on another strike. In a joint statement issued on Monday, the CTUs also alleged that the government undermined tripartism and continued its ""aggressive attack with arrogance on the lives and livelihood of the working people."" They are also opposed to the proposed amendments in Trade Union Act, 1926, saying those are irrational and extremely damaging to the independent functioning of unions.

Opponents have alleged that the new bill legitimises non-Muslim immigrants, while Muslims who might had migrated years ago to India will be deported based on the citizen's register.

Despite the Shiv Sena-affiliated union withdrawing from the protest, only five buses of the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) were plying on roads this morning, a BEST official said. Over 32,000 BEST employees went on an indefinite strike on Tuesday over various demands, including higher salaries. The state government quickly moved to invoke the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA) against the striking BEST employees, while its management asked them to end the stir and come to the negotiating table. BEST's Kamgar Sena had late Tuesday evening said that 11,000 of its members would go back to work on Wednesday to mitigate woes of Mumbaikars. It had also said that nearly 500 buses were expected to run on Wednesday. The Sena union's announcement to withdraw from the protest invited sharp criticism from BEST Workers' Union chief Shashank Rao who said the former had shown its ""true character"". The BEST has a fleet of over 3,200 buses, which criss-cross the city and also operate services in the neighbouring Thane district and Navi Mumbai. It is the second-biggest mode of transport in Mumbai after local trains, which ferry over 80 lakh passengers every day. ""However, only five buses were plying on the city roads on Wednesday morning,"" a senior BEST official said. The employees are demanding higher pay, merging budget of the loss-making transport undertaking with that of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), deliberations on new wage agreement, resuming appointments on compassionate grounds and a bonus equivalent to that of the civic body's employees. The protest by BEST employees coincided with the two-day nationwide bank strike called by trade unions to protest the government''s ""anti-worker"" policies and labour reforms. The strike, declared illegal by the industrial court in Mumbai, on Tuesday affected nearly 25 lakh daily commuters, who rely on BEST buses to reach their destinations. A BEST staffer, who is a member of the Sena-affiliated union, expressed anger over his union's decision to withdraw from the strike. ""The BEST Kamgar Sena should not have withdrawn its support to the strike. Our union leaders do not seem to have any sympathy with us,"" he told reporters on condition of anonymity. The BEST management is likely to send notices to the agitating workers on Wednesday. ""We are hopeful that our staffers will resume work, considering the hardships faced by commuters across the city,"" the official said. The commuters complained they were inconvenienced by the ongoing protest. Pramod Tamane, a Ghatkopar resident who travels to Wadala every day by BEST buses, sought to know how the government was planning to end the stalemate. ""This is too much. How can a few people be allowed to paralyse the city? What is the government doing to address this? It seems busy preparing for elections and has forgotten about the innocent citizens,"" he said. The Central Railways and the Western Railways have decided to operate additional suburban trains for the convenience of the commuters.

Central Trade Unions' Bharat Bandh Enters Day 2,Central Trade Unions' Bharat Bandh Enters Day 2,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-central-trade-unions-nationwide-strike-enters-day-two-1974954,en,"The two-day nationwide strike called by Central Trade Unions (CTUs) to protest against the alleged anti-worker policies and unilateral labour reforms by the Centre entered its second day on Wednesday, impacting normal life in some parts of the country. According to the reports, public transport and banking services remain disrupted for the second day in some states. The 10 CTUs which gave a call for the two-day strike are protesting the government's snub of their 12-point charter of demands seeking minimum wage of Rs 18,000, social security for all workers and issues related to price rise. All India Trade Union Congress General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur told news agency PTI that there will be a complete bandh in Goa and Bihar, while 100 per cent strike is expected in other parts of the country too. She said that due to UGC exams, which started from Tuesday, some state transport departments would not participate completely in the strike in the interest of students. The exams are scheduled in some states on Wednesday as well. Educational institutes, rail, banking, postal and transport services are expected to witness disruptions today too. The unions have alleged that the government has failed to create jobs and grossly ignored the unions' 12-point charter of demands. They also said that the Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on labour issues has not called unions for any discussion since the September 2015 strike which left them with no other option but to go on another strike. In a joint statement issued on Monday, the CTUs also alleged that the government undermined tri-partism and continued its ""aggressive attack with arrogance on the lives and livelihood of the working people."" They are also opposed to the proposed amendments in Trade Union Act, 1926, saying those are irrational and extremely damaging to the independent functioning of unions. Farming communities, through their associations, have also extended support to the strike. Student and teacher organizations of various universities have also declared support, the statement had said.

Members of the North East Students' Organization cashed with the police at Khumulwng, the tribal body headquarters, about 25 kilometre from Agartala. Two among them are critical. Over 100 organisations participated in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 yesterday. The police and paramilitary forces had to lathicharge and fire in the air to disperse the protesters. Those injured include a Tripura State Rifles personnel and six Twipra Students Federation (TSF) members, who were part of a group that blocked the Assam-Agartala National Highway at Madhabbari. Internet services have been suspended for two days to check spreading of rumours, said the police. ""Riots and arson were reported in Jirania and photographs of the incidents were being uploaded on social media,"" said a police officer. Photo Credit: Several people were injured in clashes with police in Tripura  In Assam, protesters blocked roads and national highways at various places and burnt vehicles, while picketers occupied railway tracks in Guwahati and Dibrugarh. Protesters clashed with the police and gheraoed Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal's house at his native place in Dibrugarh. The bandh also hit normal life in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland. The powerful Young Mizo Association (YMA), Mizoram's largest civil society organisation, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Rajnath Singh about its strong opposition to the bill. Parliament on Tuesday passed the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 amid tension in the entire northeast India. The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) yesterday snapped ties with the NDA and accused Mr Sonowal of not respecting the emotions and interests of the Assamese people. State finance minister and the BJP's strongman in the northeast, Himamta Biswa Sarma, claimed that the issue of granting citizenship to Hindu refugees from Bangladesh and Pakistan can only be resolved on ""religious"" lines. ""BJP has to take religious line because persecution of Hindus in neighboring countries happens on religious lines. It does not happen along secular lines. India right from the days of Nehru and Gandhi has been siding with Hindus. The period of residency for a refugee to get citizenship was 12 years, now we are bringing it down to 6 years. This is in line with the commitment which our founding fathers have given,"" Mr Sarma told NDTV. After Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma , another NDA partner from northeast has voiced it's dissatisfaction over passage of citizenship amendment bill in parliament. The Chief Minister of Mizoram, Zoramthanga and his party Mizo National Front (MNF) opposed the bill and had even supported yesterday's bandh . ""The bill is against the principle of secularism and would have adverse effect in the northeast,"" said Mr Zoramthanga.

Second South Korea Taxi Driver Burns Self To Protest New Ride-Sharing App,Second South Korea Taxi Driver Burns Self To Protest New Ride-Sharing App,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/second-south-korea-taxi-driver-burns-self-to-protest-new-ride-sharing-app-1975560,en,"A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country's largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month. The 64-year-old, surnamed Im, parked near the US embassy in central Seoul moments before his vehicle was engulfed in flames. The driver remained conscious after he got out of the burning vehicle on Wednesday evening, witnesses said, and was taken to a nearby hospital but died hours later, according to police, who found melted fuel bottles in the car. Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called ""illegal car-pooling"". He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence. Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue.

The gruesome crime has stirred up massive protests in the town 111 km from state capital Patna. The teen's family alleges she was raped. The police, however, believe it was a case of killing over family honour. There is growing public anger over the lack of arrests and a perceived delay in police action. The teenager went missing from her home on December 28. Her body was found in a decomposed state on January 6. Her family says the police did not act promptly when they reported that she was missing. Senior police officer Rajiv Mishra, however, has a different version to the story. He says the girl's mother and sisters claimed she had returned home on December 31, three days after she went missing. Her father, according to the family, sent her away with a man known to the family at around 10 pm the same night, the police said. The man has been detained but has denied killing the girl. But his call records indicate he was in touch with several local criminals. An autopsy report will confirm whether the girl was raped.

It plans to grant the scheduled tribe status to six prominent communities in the state. ""The central government has decided to fulfil a long-pending demand by granting scheduled tribe status to six communities. It was done to secure the future of the Assamese people. As an Assamese, I am proud that Modiji and Rajnath Singhji have done this,"" State Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told NDTV. The decision -- if implemented -- will benefit the Tai Ahom, Tea, Koch Raj Bongshi, Chutia, Moran and Matak tribes, and turn Assam into a tribal state. The move is expected to help the BJP in the Lok Sabha election because the six communities dominate Upper Assam, which accounts for a majority of the state's 126 seats. The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes reportedly cleared the proposal yesterday. ""The centre and state will now work on the modalities of the quantum of reservation because, at present, these communities are listed as other backward classes in Assam,"" Mr Sarma said. Although the BJP lost a regional ally -- the Asom Gana Parishad -- because of its decision to push the citizenship bill, it is confident of holding on to the Hindu and tribal vote bank through the decision to grant tribal status and implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord-1985 (aimed at granting constitutional safeguards to the Assamese people). The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill-2016 seeks to amend the Citizenship Act-1955 to grant Indian nationality to people from minority communities -- Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians -- from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan after six years of stay instead of 12.

In Assam, the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) has called for a state-wide bandh after a gap of 10 years and it is being supported by the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which withdrew support to the BJP-led government in Assam on Monday, the opposition Congress, the AIUDF, and the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS). Tyres were burnt on roads at various places in Assam to prevent movement of vehicles. Vehicles were damaged in Guwahati, Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts,the police said. Railway tracks were blocked briefly in Guwahati and Dibrugarh district but movement of trains, including that of the Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express, resumed after the GRP removed protestors from the tracks, railway sources said. Train and flight schedules remained unaffected. Shops, markets, financial institutions kept their shutters down, educational institutions, private offices remained closed and private vehicles, including long-distance buses, kept off roads in the Brahmaputra valley, the police and official sources said. Attendance in government offices was thin as the employees had difficulty in reaching their workplace in the absence of adequate public transport, the sources said.

Several students' bodies of the region have decided to observe the ''bandh'' in support of the call given by the North East Students' Organisation (NESO), an umbrella organisation of students' unions, of which the AASU is a constituent. Thirty ethnic organisations are also supporting the bandh in Assam. The bandh evoked response in the Bengali-majority Barak valley also where Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 4, had announced that the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016 will be passed as soon as possible in parliament as a penance for past injustices. The bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act 1955 to grant Indian citizenship to people from minority communities - Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians - from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan after six years of residence in India instead of 12 even if they do not possess any proper document. The AGP and other groups in Assam have said the provisions of the bill will nullify the 1985 Assam Accord, which provides for deportation of all illegal migrants, irrespective of religion, who had entered the state after March, 1971. Security arrangements were intensified and patrolling by the police and paramilitary forces intensified across the state in view of the bandh called by the AASU after ten years. Assam Director General of Police Kuladhar Saikia said, ""District SPs have been instructed to ensure public peace. Appropriate forces have been deployed across the state to prevent any untoward incident. Patrolling has also been intensified at all places."" Meanwhile, member organisations of the NESO in other states such as Mizo Zirlai Pawal (MZP), All Arunachal Pradesh Students' Union (AAPSU), Khasi Students Union (KSU), Garo Students Union (GSU), Naga Students'' Federation (NSF), All Manipur Students Union (AMSU) and Twipra Students Federation (TSF) are also supporting the bandh.

Most parties from the northeast, even those that were allies of the BJP, have also strongly opposed Bill, saying it is ""against the fundamental aspects of the Indian constitution"". A day-long shutdown was held against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, across the northeast today, in which five people were injured. Assam has been witnessing protests since the NDA government said it was going ahead with the controversial bill and yesterday, Asom Gana Parishad, a regional ally of the BJP, exited the ruling coalition in Assam. The state has been witnessing protests since the NDA government said it was going ahead with the controversial bill. Today, moments after the bill was passed, Assam's BJP spokesperson Mehdi Alam Bora resigned all party posts in protest. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 will amend the laws governing citizenship, formed in 1955, to grant Indian nationality to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who fled religious persecution from the three neighbouring countries and entered India before December 31, 2014. Citizenship Bill: A proposed law to give citizenship to non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan was passed by Lok Sabha today amid vigorous dissent by several opposition parties The political parties and the civil society opposing the proposed law say it would allow citizenship to illegal Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, who came to the state after March 1971, in violation to the Assam Accord, 1985. Illegal migration is a sensitive issue in the northeast, where tribals and other ethnic communities wish to keep out the outsiders. ""The burden of those persecuted migrants will be shared by the whole country. Assam alone should not have to bear the entire burden,"" Union minister Rajnath Singh said while responding to the debate on the bill. ""The government of India is committed to give all help to the state government and people of Assam,"" he said. The opposition parties say the bill links religion to citizenship and want it to be ""religion and country neutral"". ""Some people ask why Christians were included in the bill. But they have also suffered since the partition, so we have included them in the amended bill. How can there be a more secular bill,"" the minister added.

How Trinamool Protested Citizenship Bill With A PM Modi Mask And A Stick,How Trinamool Protested Citizenship Bill With A PM Modi Mask And A Stick,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-protests-citizenship-amendment-bill-with-a-narendra-modi-mask-and-a-stick-1974583,en,"As the BJP-led Union government battled with the opposition over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill-2016 in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, some of the theatrics leaked onto the parliament lawns -- becoming a little more literal in the process. The Trinamool Congress presented a protest skit that had a number of lawmakers, dressed in black, pretending to cower in fear as a colleague wearing a Narendra Modi mask hit them repeatedly with a stick. The bill, which aims to make illegal migrants of the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities eligible for Indian citizenship, has been opposed by opposition parties as well as the BJP's allies in the northeast . The Congress walked out of the house soon after Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh tabled the legislation today, alleging that a bill which discriminates on the basis of religion goes against the preamble of the Constitution. The party has termed the bill as a ""political ploy to divide and rule"" northeast India. The bill easily cleared Lok Sabha. The BJP is facing resistance in the northeast too, with protest marches being taken out across its expanse. While the Asom Gana Parishad broke ties with the BJP in Assam on Monday, unidentified people hurled molotov cocktails at the party's Meghalaya headquarters a day ago. Terming the proposed amendment to the bill as an ""attack on the country's secular fabric"", the Trinamool Congress said it would oppose the move with all its might in parliament. ""How can there be discrimination on the basis of religion? You will be eligible if you are Hindu but kept out if you are Muslim? Our Constitution does not allow this,"" party member Saugato Roy told PTI. Tuesday's novel protest was another step forward in the party's plan to oppose the amendment. ""We enacted this skit to illustrate how the centre is forcing this bill on the people against their will,"" said one of the protesting parliamentarians. The BJP, however, remains firm in its resolve to amend the law. ""I strongly believe that if this bill is not passed, Assamese Hindus will become a minority in the next five years. That will be advantageous for elements who want Assam to be another Kashmir,"" Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Monday. PM Modi's speech in support of the proposed amendment at Assam's Silchar recently had provoked a statewide backlash against the BJP, despite his claim that it was ""not for anyone's benefit"". ""The Citizenship Bill is an atonement for the wrong that was done during India's partition. I hope this bill is passed soon in parliament. India will safeguard every victim of the partition,"" he had said.

No Strike Can Be Called Without A Week's Notice: Kerala High Court,No Strike Can Be Called Without A Week's Notice: Kerala High Court,https://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/kerala-high-court-says-no-strike-can-be-called-without-a-weeks-notice-1974135,en,"Amid protests over the Sabarimala issue, the Kerala High Court on Monday said no strike can be called in the state without prior notice of at least seven days. The court made the comment while hearing a petition moved by the Kerala Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Thrissur-based NGO ''Malayala vedi against hartals'' against shutdowns in the state. Condemning the practice of calling flash strikes, a division bench of Chief Justice Hrishikesh Roy and Justice A K Jayasankaran Nambiar observed if prior notice is not given, people can approach the court and government can take adequate measures to deal with the situation. Organisations and individuals, who call for hartal, shall be responsible for loss and damages caused on account of the shutdown, the court said. It added that in the absence of adequate enactments, hartals have become a continuous process. Such flash hartals would affect the state''s economy as well as the country''s tourism prospects. The bench said though right to protest exist, that shall not affect the citizens' fundamental rights. It directed the state government to file a counter affidavit within three weeks. In their petition, the chamber alleged that Kerala witnessed 97 strikes in 2018, which affected business and livelihood of people leading to huge economic loss. The petitioners also sought police protection for shops and commercial establishments during such shutdowns. In December, over 35 trade organisations came together against rampant strike calls by various political parties in the state and decided to observe 2019 as an ''anti-hartal year''. On Thursday, a dawn-to-dusk strike called by pro-Hindutva groups plunged the state into turmoil. The shutdown was called to protest the entry of women of menstruating age into the Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala. Subsequently, violence involving BJP-RSS and ruling CPI(M) rocked parts of Kerala, particularly Kannur district, with several houses and shops of rival leaders and workers being attacked.

The anti-corruption crusader said he would launch the protest in his village Ralegansiddhi in Ahmednagar district, around 240km from here, and asked his followers to do so in their respective states.

The trade unions have called the strike to protest the central government's alleged anti-worker policies and unilateral labour reforms. ""As many as 10 central trade unions (CTUs) have joined hands to go on a two-day nationwide strike from tomorrow. We expect 20 crore workers to join the strike. This is the largest number of workers from formal and informal sectors joining the strike against anti-worker policies of the BJP-led central government,"" Amarjeet Kaur, general secretary of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) told news agency PTI. At a joint press conference of the 10 CTUs in Delhi, Amarjeet Kaur said that workers from sectors such as telecom, health, education, coal, steel, electricity, banking, insurance and transport are likely to support the strike. Farmers and students' groups are also supporting the strike, said the union leader. The protesters have planned to march from Mandi House to Parliament on Wednesday and similar marches will be held across the country. Protesters have also planned rail roko and road blockades across the country, said union leaders. The labour unions alleged that suggestions on labour codes were given to the government but they were rejected. Trade union leaders alleged that the government has ""failed to create jobs and grossly ignored"" the 12-point charter of demands, which includes minimum wages and social security schemes. The Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on labour issues is unwilling to discuss matters, claimed the trade unions.

Assam Minister Himanta Sarma's Citizenship Bill Remark Triggers Protests,Assam Minister Himanta Sarma's Citizenship Bill Remark Triggers Protests,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-minister-himanta-sarmas-citizenship-bill-remark-triggers-protests-1974019,en,"Protests broke out across Assam over state Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's remark that if the Citizenship Bill is not passed ""we will be surrendering to Jinnah's policy"". The minister on Sunday had also said people are commenting on the bill in a ""reactionary way"" and intellectuals are trying to build a ""wrong narrative"", but clarified that he was not pointing to any community. ""I am meaning (Pakistan's founding father Mohammad Ali Jinnah) Jinnah, I am not meaning any community,"" Mr Sarma had said. However, protesting organisations such as the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) and Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) alleged that Mr Sarma through his comments was trying to polarise the electorate ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced in the Lok Sabha to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who fled religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan and entered India before December 31, 2014. ""Without that bill, we are surrendering to the philosophy of Jinnah. If those people are not there, the Sarbhog seat will go to Jinnah. Do we want that? This is a fight between Jinnah's legacy and India's legacy,"" Mr Sarma had told reporters while addressing a press conference on Sunday. BJP state president Ranjit Dass represents the Sarbhog assembly seat. ""So, let the bill be passed and we will see if there is a provision of welcoming Bangladeshis in it. And, I am sure that is not there,"" he said. The minister said if we delete six lakh people from the voters list, the demography will change and ""you will not retain Assam."" ""Today, if we do not have Citizenship Bill, 17 seats that elect Assamese people will go the Jinaah way...I am meaning Jinnah, I am not meaning any community,"" Mr Sarma had said. Protesters, led by organisations, observed ''Black Day'' and carried black flags and burnt replicas of the bill across the state. In Delhi, a group staged a nude protest in front of the Parliament. Another group staged a nude protest in Assam's Tinsukia town as well against the minister's remarks. They also burnt effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal. The Left Democratic Mancha, a common platform of Left and democratic parties, organised a protest meeting. They took out a procession to Kamrup Metropolitan Deputy Commissioner's office here. Several indigenous organisations in the state have been opposing the bill as they believe it would harm their cultural identity. Mr Sarma had also said detection and deportation will be carried out, but ""not at the cost of Jinnah"" as the state cannot have a detection and deportation policy to have ""Badruddin Ajmal (AUDF chief) as the chief minister"". ""So, if something led us to make Ajmal as chief minister, then we have to change that policy,"" he had said. ""That is why all this exercise is going on. So, in my view, Citizenship Bill and Clause-6 (of Assam Accord) are complementary. The bill itself will strengthen us. If the bill is not there, we will lose Sarbhog and many other seats,"" he said. Meanwhile, the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the bill, was submitted in Parliament today after all amendments moved by the opposition in the panel were defeated on December 31 last year. Asked if implementing the Bill will not contradict the Accord, Mr Sarma said, ""Let the Accord be violated, but let us not go to Jinnah. You have to determine between a word of Assam Accord and Jinnah. Which way will you go? We are not apologetic. We trying to do something for the people of Assam and save the state from Jinnah."" He also said the ongoing update exercise of the National Register of Citizens will detect a ""lot of Jinnahs"". Reacting sharply to this, AASU General Secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi told PTI, ""These are baseless and communal statements. He is showing fear of Muslims to get Hindu votes, but people are not fools."" Despite being a public representative, the minister does not know how to speak to the people, the AASU leader alleged. KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi said, ""The makers of India and common people did not take side of Jinnah, but supported a secular country. Talking about Jinnah at this time is deliberately done to polarise the society before the polls. By doing so, he is trying to spread the communal agenda of RSS."" A total of 70 groups led by KMSS will protest in front of different offices of Oil India Limited and ONGC, Mr Gogoi said. In addition they would also stop oil, petroleum products, coal, forest products and limestone from being transported outside the state, he said. ""We all know that Himanta Biswa Sarma is a politician who changes party at the time of his crisis,"" he added. He is in BJP now and playing to the tune of RSS to save himself from Louis Berger and Sarada chit fund scams. Addressing an election rally at Silchar on January 4, Prime Minister Modi announced that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 will be passed as soon as possible in Parliament as a penance for past injustices.

No one was injured in the attack but the windows of the office chamber of state BJP President Shibun Lyngdoh were damaged. The petrol bomb attack comes amid the protests against the Modi government's bid to get the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 passed in Parliament. The Bill aims to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, to make illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan eligible for citizenship of India. ""We were informed that the incident occurred at around 11.20 p.m. and a fire engine doused the flames,"" Superintendent of Police (Shillong City) Stephan Rynjah told IANS. A team of forensic experts on Monday visited the BJP headquarters to collect samples and took possession of the CCTV footage capturing the incident. BJP legislator and Health and Family Welfare Minister Alexander Laloo Hek, who visited the party office, demanded the immediate arrest of the perpetrators.

The travel advisories by the US and the UK came in the backdrop of incidents of violent protests in Kerala over the entry of women into the Lord Ayyappa Shrine at Sabarimala. ""They haven't said don't go, but asked to remain vigilant. That itself is insulting,"" Kerala Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said on Sunday. He also said that the protests led by the BJP, the RSS and other right wing outfits had hit the tourism sector of Kerala. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), which regularly updates its advice for travel to different parts of the world, said on Friday that any British citizens planning to travel to Kerala should monitor media reports, be vigilant and avoid large public gatherings. According to media reports, the US has also issued a similar advisory. Ten per cent of Kerala's GDP comes from the tourism sector. The tourism industry is worried that frequent hartals and protests would severely impact the state which is slowly recovering from the massive devastation caused by the floods last year. Kerala has been rocked by violent protests by right wing groups after two women of the menstruating age entered the Lord Ayyappa shrine in Sabarimala on January 2.

Citizenship Amendment Bill: Northeast Student Bodies Support Shutdown Call,Citizenship Amendment Bill: Northeast Student Bodies Support Shutdown Call,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/citizenship-amendment-bill-northeast-student-bodies-support-shutdown-call-1973831,en,"Several student bodies of the north-eastern region have decided to observe a shutdown on Tuesday in support of the call given by a students' union to protest the proposed Citizens Amendment Bill, 2016. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 seeks to grant nationality to people belonging to minority communities from neighbouring countries. The Mizo Zirlai Pawal (MZP), the All Arunachal Pradesh Students' Union (AAPSU), the Naga Students' Federation (NSF) and the All Assam Students Union (AASU) have extended their support to the 11-hour ""bandh"" call by the North East Students' Organisation (NESO). The shutdown has also been called to condemn Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent statement that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 would be passed in Parliament soon, a NESO leader said. ""Despite staging various dharnas even in New Delhi by student bodies from the north-east, the Centre is hell bent to pass the controversial bill, undermining the sentiments of the indigenous people of the region,"" NESO coordinator Pritambai Sonam said. PM Modi at a rally in Assam on Friday said the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 would soon be passed in Parliament as a ""penance against the injustice and many wrongs done in the past."" MZP general secretary Lalnunmawia Pautu said the 11-hour bandh will begin from 5am in Aizawl. He said the people of the north-east are against the proposed amendment as it will grant citizenship to people on religious grounds. In Mizoram, it would mean legalising thousands of Buddhist Chakmas who had illegally entered the state from Bangladesh, Mr Pautu said. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced in the Lok Sabha to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who fled religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan and entered India before December 31, 2014. Demanding immediate scrapping of the bill, AAPSU president Hawa Bagang said, ""If the bill is passed, we will be left with no option but to take up arms to protect our indigenous population."" The NSF, in a press release, said as a constituent of the NESO, it had apprised the Centre of the detrimental effects of the bill, if it was passed in Parliament.

Video: Saudi Teen Seeking Asylum Barricades Herself In Thai Hotel Room,Video: Saudi Teen Seeking Asylum Barricades Herself In Thai Hotel Room,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/saudi-woman-rahaf-mohammed-al-qunun-caught-at-bangkok-airport-to-be-sent-back-thai-authorities-1973603,en,"A Saudi woman being held at Bangkok airport is to be sent back, Thai authorities said Monday, after she made a desperate plea for asylum, saying she feared for her life after escaping an abusive family. The incident comes against the backdrop of intense scrutiny of Saudi Arabia over its investigation and handling of the shocking murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, which has renewed criticism of the kingdom's rights record. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun told AFP she ran away from her family while travelling in Kuwait because they subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. The 18-year-old said she had planned to travel to Australia and seek asylum there, and feared she would be killed if she was repatriated by Thai immigration officials who stopped her during transit on Sunday. Thai immigration chief Surachate Hakparn had said Qunun was waiting, with local and Saudi embassy officials on hand, to board a flight to Saudi Arabia, travelling via Kuwait. ""She bought the ticket herself yesterday,"" he added. Asked if she was seeking asylum, he said ""we do not know but if anyone wants to seek asylum, they have to wait for those countries to reply"". The Kuwait Airways flight departed Bangkok as scheduled, but Qunun was not on board, according to Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch. Qunun said she was stopped by Saudi and Kuwaiti officials when she arrived at the Thai capital's Suvarnabhumi airport and her travel document was forcibly taken from her, a claim backed by HRW. Abdulilah al-Shouaibi, charge d'affaires at the Saudi embassy in Bangkok, acknowledged in an interview with Saudi-owned channel Rotana Khalijial that the woman's father had contacted the diplomatic mission for ""help"" to bring her back. But he denied that her passport had been seized and that embassy officials were present inside the airport. Barricaded in room In a sign of growing desperation during the night, Qunun posted video of her barricading her hotel room door with furniture. . @rahaf84427714 sent this: ""Based on the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol, I'm Rahaf Mohammed, formally seeking refugee status to any country that would protect me from getting harmed or killed due to leaving my religion and torture from my family. #SaveRahaf pic.twitter.com/jJSFBKC8Ka If sent back, she said she will likely be imprisoned, and is ""sure 100 percent"" her family will kill her, she told AFP. Immigration chief Surachate said Sunday that Qunun was denied entry because she lacked ""further documents such as return ticket or money"", and Thailand had contacted the ""Saudi Arabia embassy to coordinate"". Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on Twitter from its Bangkok embassy, disputing her account. ""Her passport was not impounded by the Saudi embassy"", it said, adding that she was stopped by Thai authorities for ""violating the law"". ""She will be deported to the State of Kuwait where her family"" lives, it added. Qunun, however, told AFP that she was only travelling in the Gulf state. HRW's Robertson said she ""faces grave harm if she is forced back to Saudi Arabia"", and that Thailand should allow her to see the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and apply for asylum. ""Given Saudi Arabia's long track record of looking the other way in so-called honour violence incidents, her worry that she could be killed if returned cannot be ignored,"" he said. ""She has clearly stated that she has renounced Islam which also puts her at serious risk of prosecution by the Saudi Arabian government."" The concern was echoed by Georg Schmidt, the German ambassador in Thailand. ""We are very concerned about Rahaf Mohammed and we are in contact with the Thai authorities and the embassies of the countries she has approached,"" he said on his verified Twitter account. The UNHCR said that according to the principle of non-refoulement, asylum seekers cannot be returned to their country of origin if their life is under threat, and that it has been trying to seek access to Qunun. The ultra-conservative Saudi kingdom has long been criticised for imposing some of the world's toughest restrictions on women. That includes a guardianship system that allows men to exercise arbitrary authority to make decisions on behalf of their female relatives. In addition to facing punishment for ""moral"" crimes, women can also become the target of ""honour killings"" at the hands of their families, activists say. Saudi Arabia has come under fierce criticism following the murder of dissident journalist Khashoggi inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate on October 2 -- a case that stunned the world. Another Saudi woman, Dina Ali Lasloom, was stopped in transit in the Philippines in April 2017 when she attempted to flee her family.

"""Money Spent Unacceptable"": Yellow Vest Protesters Attack French Ministry","""Money Spent Unacceptable"": Yellow Vest Protesters Attack French Ministry",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/yellow-vest-protesters-attack-french-ministry-clash-with-police-in-several-cities-1973471,en,"""Yellow vest"" protesters returned in force to the streets of France this weekend, clashing with police in several cities and smashing their way into a government ministry in Paris with the help of a forklift truck. The interior ministry put the number of protesters who took to the streets on Saturday at 50,000, compared with 32,000 on December 29 when the movement appeared to be weakening after holding a series of weekly Saturday protests since mid-November. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, who was evacuated from his ministry in central Paris when a handful of protesters in high-visibility vests smashed down the large wooden door to the ministry compound, denounced the break-in as an ""unacceptable attack on the Republic"". ""Some yellow vest protesters and other people dressed in black ... got hold of a construction vehicle which was in the street nearby and smashed open the entrance gate to the ministry,"" he told AFP. They briefly entered the courtyard where they smashed up two cars, broke some windows then escaped, he added, saying police were trying to identify them from security footage. President Emmanuel Macron did not specifically refer to the incident, but tweeted his condemnation of the ""extreme violence"" against ""the Republic, its guardians, its representatives and its symbols"". Griveaux had on Friday criticised the yellow vest movement, describing those still involved as ""agitators"" who were seeking ""to overthrow the government"". Police said some 3,500 demonstrators turned up on the Champs-Elysees on Saturday morning. Some then made their way south of the river to the wealthy area around Boulevard St Germain, where they set light to a car and several motorbikes and set up burning barricades, prompting police to fire tear gas to try and disperse them. Police said 35 people were arrested. Demonstrators took to the streets of several other cities across France, with up to 2,000 people in Rouen northwest of Paris, where some set up burning barricades. One protester was injured and at least two others were arrested, police said. Some 4,600 protesters hit the streets of the southwestern city of Bordeaux, with some hurling stones at police who answered with tear gas and water cannon. Five police were hurt and 11 people arrested, local authorities said, adding that several cars were torched and shop windows broken. Further south in Toulouse, 22 people were detained following clashes that erupted after 2,000 people turned out to demonstrate. And in the central-eastern city of Lyon, several thousands took to the streets, blocking access to the A7 motorway and causing traffic jams for those returning from Christmas holidays in the mountains. The yellow vest movement began in rural France over plans to increase fuel taxes. But it later ballooned into a wider revolt against Macron's pro-market policies and governing style, with 282,000 people joining the first Saturday rally on November 17. Macron initially refused to make any concessions, but in mid-December, after weeks of violence, he scrapped the planned fuel tax hike and promised extra cash for minimum wage earners as well as tax cuts for pensioners. The protests have turned into the biggest political crisis of Macron's 20-month presidency and brought his popularity ratings to an all-time low. Although public anger appeared to abate following his concessions and over the holiday period, the brief arrest on Wednesday of Eric Drouet, one of the leaders of the movement, appeared to rekindle resentment among his supporters. The latest opinion poll, published on Thursday by Odoxa Dentsu, indicated 55 percent support the protests -- a figure which, although lower than the 75 percent back in November, is still important enough to suggest the anti-austerity movement retains political clout. Former cinema icon Brigitte Bardot, who is known today for her rightwing views and animal rights activism, on Sunday said she understood what motivated the yellow vest movement. ""When I see the millions spent on incredibly trivial things, when I see politicians using private planes and chauffeur-driven cars to get around (...) all this money spent is unacceptable,"" she told the Midi Libre newspaper. ""It should be given instead to people in need."" Get the latest election news , live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

He added that the updation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is being done to ""drive out the Jinnahs"", in an apparent reference to the Muslims of Bengali origin residing in Assam. ""This is a fight between the legacy of Jinnah and India. The NRC is a process to weed out the Jinnahs. If we do not implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord, then Badruddin Ajmal will become chief minister and if there is no Citizenship Bill, at least 17 seats will go to the Jinnahs,"" Mr Sarma told reporters on Sunday. Mr Ajmal is an MP from Dhubri and chief of the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has formed a high-power committee to look into the implementation of the Clause 6 of the Assam Accord that safeguards the socio-political rights and culture of the ""indigenous people of Assam"". ""We have discussed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding legal immunity for the indigenous people, and we have made recommendations to the ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)-constituted committee for the implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord. PM Modi has said he will think on the proposal of bringing the recommendations of the committee under Article 371. However, the committee has to recommend that it wants to be covered under 371 which provides special provisions for states like Nagaland and Sikkim,"" Mr Sarma told reporters in Guwahati hinting at a possible move to give 'special status' to Assam ahead of the crucial general elections. Assam has 14 Lok Sabha seats and seven of them are with the BJP. Mr Sarma also hinted at 'reservations' in the assembly, local bodies and even in jobs for Assamese people.

Around a thousand protesters gathered on the Champs-Elysees in central Paris, where around 15 police wagons were also deployed, an AFP journalist said. Some paused outside the headquarters of Agence France-Presse (AFP) in central Paris to hurl anti-media insults. Police fired tear gas in the capital after protesters threw projectiles at police and AFP journalists saw minor scuffles near the River Seine as up to 4,000 joined the fray in the city by the afternoon, according to police. Some protesters set bins ablaze and material damage included several burned out motorcycles strewn across streets. Protesters gathered on the Champs-Elysees in central Paris. (Reuters) ""I am here to defend the right of my children to work that enables them to eat. My daughter earns 800 euros ($911) a month. She works 25 hours a week in a baker's. For her, it's about surviving,"" said one protester, 58-year-old Ghislaine. Several other cities across France also saw small marches -- including up to 2,000 in Rouen northwest of Paris, where at least two arrests were made and one protester was hurt by a projectile after demonstrators set fire to a barricade. The scale and intensity of the protests has shrivelled in recent weeks, however, and authorities put Saturday's nationwide turnout at around 12,000, compared with 282,000 for the initial rally on November 17. Public anger has on occasion been directed at the media, seen by some as too close to the government. Several journalists have been assaulted since the protests called by the grass-roots movement started in November. Last Saturday saw scuffles in Paris between some demonstrators denouncing media ""collaborators"" and police outside the headquarters of broadcasters BFMTV and France Televisions. Police fired tear gas in the capital after protesters threw projectiles at them. Police made four arrests Friday evening in the northeastern city of Nancy after some 50 demonstrators tried to block the entrance of newspaper L'Est Republicain. On Friday, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux denounced those still protesting as ""agitators who want insurrection and, basically, to overthrow the government"".

Will Deal With RSS Violence Sternly: Kerala Chief Minister On Sabarimala Protests,Will Deal With RSS Violence Sternly: Kerala Chief Minister On Sabarimala Protests,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sabarimala-temple-row-violence-in-kerala-several-politicians-houses-attacked-1973176,en,"Violence erupted in parts of Kerala, particularly Kannur district, today with several houses and shops of political leaders and workers being attacked over the Sabarimala temple issue. Violence had broken out across Kerala on Wednesday when two women entered the temple. Perambra in Kozhikode, Malappuram and Adoor in Pathanamthitta, where the Ayyappa shrine is located, also witnessed a series of similar attacks and vandalism on Friday night and in the early hours of today. Bombs were thrown at several places, including at the houses of CPI(M) lawmaker AN Shamseer in Madapeedikayil, BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member V Muraleedharan at Vadiyil Peedikia and former Kannur district secretary of CPI(M) P Sasi at Thalassery in Kannur district past midnight, the police said. No one was injured in the attacks. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Sangh Parivar (referring to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) is trying to create fear in people's minds. The Opposition Congress hit out, asking why the Left government failed to stop the RSS from creating trouble. Meanwhile, a peace meeting called by the Revenue Divisional Officer at Adoor in Pathanamthitta district was boycotted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP claimed that they decided to stay away as the police failed to arrest the accused in connection with the death of Chandran Unnithan, a 'Sabarimala Karma Samiti' member who, they alleged, was killed in stone-pelting on January 3. Chief minister Vijayan said: ""The state will deal with the RSS violence sternly. They are trying to destroy the peace and tranquility of the state. We will take strong action against it. It's the RSS agenda to create fear in the minds of the people."" He said people of the state have shown restraint. ""The RSS workers were attacking houses of MLAs, and other leaders. Their only aim and route is violence. The law and order system of the state will take care of it."" Senior congress leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged the state police had failed to maintain law and order. ""DGP himself has accepted this. Why has government failed to stop the BJP from creating violence?"" Mr Chennithala asked. Two women, 44-year-old Kanakadurga and 42-year-old Bindu, entered the Sabarimala shrine and offered prayers on Wednesday, breaking a centuries-old tradition. Following this, the priest, Kandaru Rajeevaru, closed the sanctum sanctorum to perform a ""purification"" ceremony. In Delhi, BJP national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao hit out at the CPI(M) state leadership and said the violence around the hill shrine was unleashed by the LDF government, which, instead of dealing with it in a sensible way, wreaked havoc, resulting in devotees being hurt and even killed. Meanwhile, Pathanamthitta district collector has extended prohibitory orders at Sabarimla till the 'Makaravilakku' festival on January 14. State police chief Loknath Behera has sounded a state-wide alert and gave direction to take stern action against those responsible for attacks on houses of party leaders. According to Mr Behara, 1,286 cases have been registered till now and 3,282 people were arrested in connection with the violent incidents since the January 3. Of the arrested, 487 have been remanded and 2,795 granted bail. A police release said patrolling and raids have been intensified across Kannur. The police carried out a route march today morning in Thalassery. The police said stone-pelting was reported against a march taken out by DYFI and BJP in Kannur district this evening, but no one was injured. It has been decided that no marches will be allowed to be taken out tonight and tomorrow, according to the police. Some people also set fire to an office of the RSS in Pariyaram area in the morning. The CPI(M) and BJP-RSS leaderships blamed each other for the violent attacks. CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the RSS is trying to trigger riots in the state and sabotage peace talks. ""The RSS-BJP combine is turning temples and educational institutions managed by them as armoury,"" he alleged, adding the ruling party will take the initiative to restore peace in violence-hit areas. Countering the charges, V Muraleedharan said the incidents of violence were the tactics of the ruling CPI(M) to divert attention from the controversies and protests over the violation of the traditional customs at the Sabarimala temple.

Protests In Assam After PM Says Government Working On Citizenship Bill,Protests In Assam After PM Says Government Working On Citizenship Bill,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/protests-in-assam-after-pm-modi-says-government-working-on-citizenship-bill-1973130,en,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who launched the BJP's campaign for the upcoming national elections in the northeast on Friday, has made it clear that his government is going forward with the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which has been vehemently opposed in Assam. At a rally in Silchar, PM Modi said that citizenship for Hindus from neighbouring countries is an emotive issue, but his government is protecting the interests of the indigenous communities of Assam by setting up a high-power committee for the implementation of the Clause 6 of the Assam Accord that safeguards the socio-political rights and culture of the ""indigenous people of Assam"". Protests erupted across the state after his rally. The agitators burnt effigies of PM Modi in Lower Assam and Dibrugarh, even as Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal assured the people that he would protect the interests of the state. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, to grant nationality to people belonging to minority communities -- Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians -- in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan after six years of their residence in India. Several indigenous organisations in the state have been opposing the bill as they believe it would harm their cultural identity. ""The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is linked with emotions and related to people's lives. It is not for the benefit of anyone but a penance against the injustice and many wrongs done in the past. I hope the bill is passed in the parliament soon,"" PM Modi said. But his remarks drew sharp reactions from both allies as well as the opposition. Former Chief Minister of Assam Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and leader of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), a BJP ally, said, ""Our party's stand is clear that if they go ahead with this bill and make it a law, we will part ways. Our alliance with BJP is a pre-poll alliance, so the BJP should have the morality to face the verdict of the people. Their decision on the bill will impact the prospects of the alliance."" The Congress alleged that his rallies are an excuse to skip the parliament where he will be asked tough questions. ""On Thursday, he had a rally in Punjab and a day later he was in Assam. All this is nothing but an excuse to run away from discussions on two of his major blunders -- the President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir and the overpriced Rafale deal. He wants to avoid parliament,"" Gaurav Gogoi, Congress MP from Assam, told NDTV. The powerful All Assam Student Union (AASU) that spearheaded the anti-illegal migrant crusade is also up in arms against the BJP. ""They are violating the Assam accord by trying to bring the citizenship amendment bill. The high-level committee is a complete eyewash. During the 2014 election campaign, he said all Bangladeshis will have to go. He asked them to pack their bags. He is trying to protect the interest of Bangladeshis. It's a double standard,"" said AASU's adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjee. Around 70 organisations, led by Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), took out protest rallies in the state capital this morning. The KMSS members had plans to march to the Asom Gana Parishad headquarters to ask the party to break off its alliance with the BJP, but the police prevented them from doing so, its leader Akhil Gogoi told reporters. ""The bill will put the identity of the indigenous people at stake. We cannot tolerate a leader coming from Delhi and threatening our very existence while the chief minister and other BJP leaders applaud him,"" Mr Gogoi said. But Mr Sonowal urged all to maintain calm. ""I am the chief minister of Assam and I have been entrusted with the duty of protecting the interest of the people of both Brahmaputra and Barak Valley. People should not doubt the government's intention,"" he told reporters.

Alleging that BJP activists and leaders were being targeted by the Kerala government under the garb of implementing the Supreme Court judgment permitting entry of all women to the Sabarimala temple, Mr Rao accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of giving a free hand to CPI-M workers to perpetuate violence against BJP supporters. Mr Rao contested the Chief Minister's claim that a BJP worker at the Sabarimala temple died of cardiac failure, insisting that he died due to injuries caused by stones pelted by CPI-M activists.

Mr Naidu was in East Godavari district for the 'Janmabhoomi maa vooru' event in Kakinada when BJP leaders, including some corporators, raised slogans against the chief minister saying 'CM go back'. ""You will get beaten up. Don't invite unnecessary trouble. You will be finished. Do you support the injustice meted out to AP? If you go on the streets, people will teach you a lesson,"" he said. Mr Naidu has been constantly criticising PM Modi and the BJP, accusing them of betraying the people of Andhra Pradesh by not granting special status to the state. On Tuesday, Mr Naidu had claimed that he bowed down to satisfy the ego of Prime Minister Modi for getting things done for his state, yet the central government did not cooperate in the last four years. Chandrababu Naidu's party, TDP, walked out of the NDA alliance in March last year, claiming that the promises made by the centre during the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh were not kept. Since then he has constantly flayed the central government over denial of Special Category Status or SCS to the state and 'failure' to implement provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 and accused the Prime Minister of seeking to create a wedge between the two Telugu states.

Participating in the debate on the issue during Zero Hour, Ms Lekhi said a narrative was coming from the people, who ""neither understand Hinduism nor do they know the practices of rituals"". From Kamakhya to Chengallur, the goddesses are worshipped as "" rajaswala "" in the menstruating form, she said. ""This is what Hinduism is. So, we have a space for everything and one such ritual in a small temple like Sabarimala has its own ritualistic practices."" Referring to the entry of women in the Sabarimala temple on Wednesday, Ms Lekhi attacked the Left government in Kerala, saying, ""(The) government, which is refusing to maintain law and order in that state, is acting in a manner where it transports two women in an ambulance and surreptitiously takes them as a transgender."" The BJP leader alleged that a certain kind of narrative was being set in the country where men are made to feel small and anti-feminist about the issue. ""One person has died because of stone-pelting. The state government is squarely responsible for their deaths. Guruswamy, one among four of those worshippers, had committed suicide. You are actually doing things to provoke (the) community. You are leading to a particular anarchical form,"" she added. Echoing similar sentiments, Congress MP K K Venugopal said, ""In entire Kerala, the minds of people -- the devotees of Sabarimala -- have become very much upset (with the incident)."" CPI parliamentarian P Karunakaran said according to the Constitution, each and every citizen has the right to go to the temple or to any other place. ""The Supreme Court has given that verdict and we are upholding that. Not only we, Uma Bharti, Subramanian Swamy, Maneka Gandhi and many other BJP persons and Congress persons have upheld this verdict,"" he said, while referring to the Supreme Court's order to strike down a rule that disallowed girls and women in the 10-50 age group from entering the Sabarimala temple. Kerala had witnessed unprecedented violence and mayhem on Thursday, a day after two women entered the hill shrine, infuriating right-wing outfits, with protesters blocking roads by placing burning tyres and granite blocks.

This number includes two CPI(M) workers who were arrested earlier today in connection with the death of a right-wing activist during a clash in Pandalam. Police have registered 801 cases related to the violence that broke out after various Hindu groups called for a state-wide shutdown of shops and other establishments yesterday to protest against the entry of the women. On Wednesday, two Malayalee women in their forties -- Bindu and Kanakadurga -- unexpectedly entered the temple premises around 3.45 am and offered prayers in the presence of police personnel. Right-wing activists armed with stones and crude bombs took to the streets in protest, clashing with the police and threatening local businessmen. Chandran Unnithan, a Sabarimala Karma Samiti worker, died in a clash with CPI(M) activists at Pandalam. By evening the next day, nearly 750 protesters had been arrested and over 30 policemen injured.

Sasikala, a 46-year-old woman from Sri Lanka , became the third person to successfully undertake the Sabarimala pilgrimage with police assistance on Thursday night. The BJP has been scathing in its attacks on Mr Vijayan. Yesterday, Union Minister Ananth Kumar Hegde termed the state government's handling of the Sabarimala issue as the ""daylight rape"" of Hindus. Party leader V Muraleedharan also alleged that Ms Bindu and Ms Kanakadurga were Maoists, and the communist government in Kerala was guilty of helping them desecrate a religious site. Incidentally, the chief priest had decided to close the sanctum sanctorum of the temple for over an hour in order to perform a ""purification ceremony"" after the women's visit. Kerala Minister EP Jayarajan called it contempt of court because untouchability is against the law. The Supreme Court will start hearing a legal challenge to its previous ruling on January 22.

Mr Vijayan, who is mostly based in the state capital, on Wednesday oversaw the arrests of 109 Sangh Parivar activists on charges of unleashing violence in various parts of the capital city district. The last time a Kerala Chief Minister came under attack was in October 2013, at Kannur, when Oommen Chandy was targeted by stone-throwing Left supporters, injuring him in the chest and face.

The powerful image is in wide circulation on social media as protests rage across Kerala over two women entering the Sabarimala temple defying a decades-old ban on women below 50, or of menstrual age. Several in the media faced attacks during a 12-hour shutdown call by right-wing groups. The cameraperson in the image, Shajila Abdulrahman of Kairali TV, suffered blows from protesters in state capital Thiruvananthapuram. She was abused and heckled, but she kept filming. The protesters even tried to snatch her camera. She is in hospital and needs to wear a neck-brace. ""I was not crying out of fear. I was in tears because of helplessness,"" Shajila told NDTV. She admitted she used the camera to try and hide the tears. ""What could I do if five-six people come from the back, snatch my camera, hit me and push me down? How do I retaliate? I was crying because I realised I lost precious visuals and time to shoot, as I had to get back my camera, plug in the batteries and restart the camera. I didn't want people to see my pain, and that's why I tried to hide my face with the camera."" In tweets, people have praised Shajila's ""bravery and professionalism"". The protests began after two women in their forties walked into the hilltop shrine around 3.45 am on Wednesday morning, escorted by policemen. They were the first to achieve their mission since the Supreme Court ended the restriction on women between 10 and 50 entering the shrine; more than a dozen women tried to visit Sabarimala over the past three months but were blocked by protesters. After the two women succeeded, right-wing groups who have strongly opposed the Supreme Court order ending the ban accused the ruling Left of hurting Hindu sentiment. Attacked by parties like the BJP and the Congress, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan yesterday said the women were helped by devotees. He also said he was duty-bound to follow the Supreme Court order. The shutdown on Wednesday was called by Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an umbrella organisation of various right-wing groups, and the Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP). Three journalists were injured during the protests in Thiruvananthapuram, which spurred a boycott call by the media.

In a CCTV footage released by police sources, the Sri Lankan national is seen going inside the temple with the irumudi kettu or offerings kit on her head. Sasikala, a citizen of the island nation, earlier told reporters that she was near the 18 golden steps that lead to the shrine when she was stopped by the police. The police later said she managed to offer darshan . Ms Sasikala is the third woman of menstruating age to have offered darshan to Lord Ayyappa after Bindu and Kanaka Durga, both in their early 40s, who on Wednesday made history. Protesters have been targeting women under 50 who attempt the trek to the Sabarimala temple after the Supreme Court's order in September last year. Sasikala, a citizen of the island nation, earlier told that she was near the 18 golden steps. ""I did not get darshan . They did not let me go... I have a medical certificate,"" Ms Sasikala earlier said, before the police confirmed that she did manage to offer prayers inside the temple later. Her medical papers show her uterus was removed. Ms Sasikala said she has fulfilled every condition needed to visit the temple. ""They have a 48-day fasting rule; I have done the 48-day fast."" Priests and many devotees strongly believe that the ban on women between 10 and 50 years should stay as the deity Lord Ayyappa is celibate. Both the BJP and the Congress have protested against the state government for allowing the two women inside the temple on Wednesday. Armed with stones and crude bombs, mobs took to the streets in Kerala during the dawn-to-dusk strike on Thursday, clashing with the police, forcing shops to shut and attacking offices of the ruling CPM and its allies in several districts. The strike was called by Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an umbrella organisation of right-wing groups, and the Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad. The opposition BJP supported the strike while the Congress observed a ""black day"". BJP Rajya Sabha member V Muraleedharan petitioned Home Minister Rajnath Singh for a detailed probe on the background of the two women and how they entered the temple through a backdoor, helped by the state government. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the state provided protection to the two women because it was obeying the Supreme Court's order.

"With Sabarimala Protests, BJP Attempts New Dark Age For Kerala","With Sabarimala Protests, BJP Attempts New Dark Age For Kerala",https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/with-sabarimala-protests-bjp-attempts-new-dark-age-for-kerala-1971939,en,"""Long ago on the streets of Vaikkom in a rickshaw The great sage Sree Narayana was going An idiot born as god on earth Came up and ordered the rickshaw to withdraw."" (From a poem written on the Vaikom Satyagraha by the famous Malayalam poet Muloor Padmanabha Panicker) The developments in Kerala should be a matter of concern for citizens across India. It was Swami Vivekananda who, appalled by the inhuman rigid caste-based rules and rituals of Kerala society at the time, had called it "" a madhouse."" The Kerala renaissance led by great social reformers like Ayyankali, Shree Narayana Guru, Chattambi Swami and others from different communities had, through tremendous courage and sacrifice, confronted, resisted and defeated the forces of orthodoxy and conservatism operating in the name of religious tradition and belief. Their heroic and visionary endeavors loosened the shackles of caste discrimination and violence against Dalits, avarnas, especially women, and gave them the confidence to fight for dignity and rights and helped transform Kerala society. It was the communists, progressive and democratic forces who took that legacy forward to expand it to include economic justice and rights of the working people and they adopted a model of development which has brought Kerala to the first place in the country in all social indicators. Protesters blocked highways in many parts of Kerala after two women entered the Sabarimala temple. Today, the forces of darkness which had turned Kerala into that madhouse have been reincarnated in the form of those who are roaming the streets shouting filthy abuse at the Chief Minister, burning buses, smashing cars, attacking ordinary people on the roads, brandishing sticks and throwing stones, all because two women entered the temple in Sabarimala. ""Women menstruate, ipso facto they are impure, their presence in the temple will defile the deity, tradition tells us so, this is our faith and therefore must be respected."" It is a terrible, dangerous rewind to the days of the madhouse. The concern is because the hooliganism is organised by members of the political party that rules India. Its leader has taken oath as Prime Minister, swearing allegiance to the constitution of India. But in Kerala, it is only because the state government led by Pinarayi Vijayan is fulfilling its constitutional duty by implementing the Supreme Court order in the Sabarimala case that his men are enraged. The court had lifted the ban on the entry of women in the fertile age bracket, calling it unconstitutional. Two women who reached the temple early last morning expressed their wish to worship the deity. They were given the required protection to do so. Earlier, other women had tried to enter the shrine but were always obstructed by Sangh Parivar men, who surrounded them, shouting abuse, manhandling them and deliberately tried to provoke the police into using force, knowing that this would affect the thousands if not lakhs of devotees who would be present at any given time. Two women below 50 walked into the Sabarimala temple in Kerala before daybreak on Wednesday The Kerala government refused to fall into the trap. It had reiterated its commitment to implement the Supreme Court judgement. Many of the troublemakers who tried to physically prevent the women were identified and arrested. This time there was no obstruction. The game of the RSS-BJP Sangh Parivar was foiled. The tantri or head priest shut the temple and performed a purification ceremony to wash away the polluting presence of the two women. This gentleman has been taking advice from the BJP state president PS Sreedharan Pillai. This became public when a recording of their conversation was broadcast in which the BJP leader is heard assuring the priest of all protection. Was it under his advice that the priest acted as he did? This outrageous action demeaning women is exactly what Dalits have and still do face in so many temples today. The purification rituals performed in the Sabarimala temple are completely illegal, an act of grave insult to women, an assault on democracy. The government will surely explore the legal measures required against this act. The Sabarimala temple shut down for ritual ""purification"" briefly after the two women entered the shrine The entry of women into the temple, a decision taken by them, comes in the background of a widespread campaign in Kerala upholding the rights of women in all spheres, including the right to worship. The campaign did not urge women on whether to enter the temple. It held that these are individual decisions. It however attacked the retrograde thinking about menstruation; menstruation is creation, not crime, why should women be punished, was the question asked by thousands of activists fanning out to houses, speaking at public meetings, breaking the social taboo that such things should not be discussed in public. For two months, this inspiring campaign reawakened the love and respect for the social reform movement and its leaders and the history of the Kerala renaissance. It reminded Keralites of the dangers of being pushed back to the dark ages by those who want to destroy this legacy. It was an unprecedented campaign which in this phase culminated in the historic Women's Wall for women's equality and rights in defense of the values of the renaissance. Never before has this country, or indeed the world, witnessed such an event in which over 5 million women stood shoulder-to-shoulder, covering a distance of more than 620 kms from one end of Kerala to another. They were from all communities, from all walks of life, of all ages, spirited, joyous taking a pledge not to allow Kerala to become a madhouse again. An estimated 30-50 lakh women came together to form the human wall from Kasargod in northern Kerala to Thiruvananthapuram in the south to promote gender equality But the challenge faced is serious and enormous. In his most recent interview, the Prime Minister justified his party's position on the Sabarimala judgement, saying it is a matter of faith. This mask of ""faith"" has been used historically against all steps of social change and reform. It was used to justify the aggressive mobilizations in support of Sati and against the proposed law banning widow immolation and its glorification through Sati temples after the horrific burning of 21-year-old Roop Kanwar on the pyre of her husband in 1987. It was used before the demolition of the Babri Masjid. It is being used to justify lynchings in the name of the cow. So when the Prime Minister speaks of faith when his men are indulging in violence, well, it should certainly be a matter of concern. It should also be a matter of concern for all secular minded people that the main opposition party in Kerala, the Congress in Kerala has announced that its MPs will give a memorandum to the Prime Minister today to request him to bring an ordinance for the takeover of the Sabarimala temple. Nothing would Please the PM more: a Mandir ordinance for Sabarimala today, can Ayodhya be far behind. Such utterly opportunist politics will prove to be a self goal for the Congress in Kerala. Priests and many devotees strongly believe that the ban on women between 10 and 50 years should stay as the deity Lord Ayyappa is celibate Solidarity actions with the Women's Wall and support for the role of the Kerala government in fulfillng its responsibility to implement the Supreme Court order are taking place in several states. In the coming days, these solidarity actions will surely increase. When right-wing forces led by those in power threaten, bully and intimidate all those who stand for democracy and equality, the message of the Women's Wall has a resonance far beyond the boundaries of Kerala.

He will also inaugurate a dozen projects in Manipur, and address a public rally. The 25 Lok Sabha seats in the Northeastern region are key to the BJP's political prospects in the upcoming parliamentary polls. However, resentment may be building in Silchar. A majority of the people in this region -- the hub of Assam's Barak Valley -- are Bengali-speaking people, and a number of Bengali Hindus who voted for the BJP in the last elections were left out of the National Register of Citizens draft. Many of the people in the region had supported the BJP in the 2016 assembly election because of its unfulfilled promise to bring the Citizenship Amendment Bill. The legislation -- which aims to change the definition of illegal migrants of certain communities -- has been termed ""anti-Assam"" by many regional parties. Meanwhile, workers of the Hindustan Paper Corporation plan to hold a demonstration at PM Modi's rally to protest the BJP's unfulfilled promise of reopening the Nagaon and Panchgram mills. Terrorist groups in Manipur have called for a boycott of PM Modi's rally and organised a general strike as a mark of protest.

Yogesh Raj, a Bajrang Dal activist dubbed ""Accused no 1"" in the killing of the officer in mob frenzy over alleged cow slaughter, was caught last night. Yogesh Raj had eluded the police for 30 days and even sent videos from hiding . Reports suggest he was arrested only after the Bajrang Dal, a Hindu rightwing outfit, turned him in. The police claimed in a press release that an informer alerted them to Yogesh Raj's plan to go to Khurja, about 20 km from Bulandshahr, last night. The police say they laid a trap and caught him near a popular college. On December 3, Yogesh Raj had filed a police complaint of cow slaughter after five carcasses were found scattered in a forest. He had named seven accused and led a protest. An argument between the protesters and the police escalated and violence erupted. Officer Subodh Kumar Singh was chased, cornered in a field and shot dead by the mob of 400 which allegedly included activists of the Bajrang Dal, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and a youth wing member of the ruling BJP. The UP administration has been accused of inaction in the killing of the policeman but displaying more alacrity in rounding up suspects for cow slaughter. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in a security meeting right after the incident, had ordered strict action for cow slaughter but had apparently not discussed the policeman's killing. Bulandshahr violence: Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was chased, cornered in a field and shot dead by the mob of 400 Five Muslim men arrested on the basis of Yogesh Raj's complaint were held for two weeks and eventually let off for lack of evidence.

A man arrested on January 1, Kalua, is accused of attacking the inspector with an axe , chopping off a couple of his fingers and then inflicting a head wound. Prashant Nutt, the man who allegedly shot the officer, was arrested on December 28. He, Kalua and a third man, Johnny, who had snatched the officer's revolver were identified from a cellphone video.

As news of the women's entry travelled, the shrine was controversially shut down for an hour and a half for ""purification"" Kerala minister EP Jayarajan called it contempt of court, saying: ""untouchability is against the law."" The Supreme Court, meanwhile, refused an urgent hearing of a petition against the Sabarimala temple authorities for closing down the shrine on Wednesday. Announcing the 12-hour shutdown on behalf of the Sabarimala Karma Samiti Samiti, its leader KP Sasikala said the government has ""betrayed"" devotees. The organisation, which is spearheading protests against the Supreme Court's September verdict allowing women of all age groups to offer prayers at the hill shrine, asked people to cooperate with them in their protest.

Protests have erupted across Kerala after two women below 50 walked into the Sabarimala temple in Kerala before daybreak on Wednesday, becoming the first to do so since the Supreme Court ordered the end of a decades-old ban on women of menstrual age entering the shrine. The ruling BJP and other groups have called for a state-wide shutdown today . The Congress-led United Democratic Front said it would observe a ""black day"". A Sabarimala Karma Samithi activist who was injured during stone pelting in yesterday's clash has also succumbed to the injuries. In a video accessed by NDTV, the women were seen hurrying into the shrine, dressed in all-black and escorted by the police yesterday.

Police used stun grenades, tear gas shells and water cannons to disperse the protesters. Protests erupted across the state soon after news of the women trekking to the hill shrine spread. The temple itself was closed for over an hour for ""purification"". Kerala Minister EP Jayarajan claimed this amounts to contempt of court because ""untouchability is against the law"". Thiruvananthapuram is currently in a tense standoff that has lasted over four hours, with neither side showing any sign of backing down. Police could also be seen charging at protesters who were trying to enforce a shutdown of shops in the area. A few policemen were injured after protesters targeted them with stones. Bindu and Kanaka Durga, both in their early 40s, entered the hilltop shrine around 3.45 am . A video accessed by NDTV showed them hurrying into the shrine along with a police team even as a group protested in the backdrop. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan confirmed the visit. ""It is a fact that the women entered the shrine. Police are bound to offer protection to anyone wanting to worship at the shrine,"" he said. During the protests that followed, BJP workers waved black flags at State Minister For Temple Bodies Kadakampally Surendran and Health Minister KK Shylaja in Guruvayur. BJP workers took out a march in the state capital and blocked a national highway in Kasaragod. Right-wing activist Rahul Easwar said his group -- the Ayyappa Dharma Sena -- would take ""appropriate action"" after more information comes through. Kerala has been on the boil since last September, when the Supreme Court overturned an age-old ban preventing women of menstrual age from visiting the Ayyappa temple. Over a dozen women attempted to do so, but were stopped by a wall of protesters less than a kilometre away from the temple. However, the Left government remains firm in its resolve to stand by the Supreme Court verdict. On Tuesday, it organised a massive women's chain extending from the northern tip of Kerala to its extreme south to push for equal rights for women in all spheres of life. An estimated 30-50 lakh women participated in the event. The Supreme Court is to start hearing a legal challenge to its ruling on January 22.

The comment came on a day when the southern state witnessed widespread right-wing protests against the entry of two women into the Lord Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala. Clashes were witnessed in state capital Thiruvananthapuram, with police using tear gas bombs and water cannons to disperse agitators. ""The chief minister's prejudice, rather than the Leftist prejudice, is causing complete confusion in Kerala. The Supreme Court has given the direction, I totally agree with that. But since law and order is a state subject, it should have seen how it can be managed diplomatically without hurting the faith of the masses,"" Mr Hegde told news agency ANI in a measured tone, before pausing to drop his bombshell: ""The Kerala government has entirely failed. I would like to say that it's totally daylight rape on Hindu people."" This is not the first time the Union Minister has stirred up a controversy with ill-considered remarks on sensitive issues. Last year, he described Dalit protesters who waylaid his convoy en route to a job fair in Karnataka's Ballari as ""dogs barking on the road"". A few months later, he compared the opposition to ""crows, monkeys, foxes and others"" that had come together to fight the tiger that's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Even the Janata Dal(United), a BJP ally, asked him to mind his language. In 2017, he said that his party -- the BJP -- would change the Constitution by removing the word ""secular"" from it -- provoking protests across the country. The same year, he was caught slapping a doctor on camera because he wasn't happy with the medical treatment provided to his mother. Mr Hegde is just the latest in a list of a high-profile individuals to loosely use the word ""rape"" in an otherwise unrelated context. Two years ago, Bollywood star Salman Khan was forced to apologise for telling reporters that his gruelling filming schedule made him feel like a ""raped woman"" .

Venkaiah Naidu Orders Protesting Tamil Nadu Lawmakers Out Of Rajya Sabha,Venkaiah Naidu Orders Protesting Tamil Nadu Lawmakers Out Of Rajya Sabha,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-chairman-m-venkaiah-naidu-orders-protesting-aidmk-and-dmk-tamil-nadu-lawmakers-out-of-ra-1971530,en,"Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu Wednesday ordered members of AIDMK and DMK to leave the House for the day when they continued to protest in the Well over the Cauvery issue. The House had to be adjourned twice in the afternoon amid din over the issue and finally for the day, minutes after it reassembled at 3 PM. The protest by these members prompted Mr Naidu to invoke Rule 255, asking over a dozen members of both parties from Tamil Nadu to leave the House for the day. Rule 255 provides that the Chairman may direct any member whose conduct, in his opinion, is grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the council. It says any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the reminder of the day's meeting. AIADMK members had trooped into the well as soon as the House resumed in the afternoon and were continuously shouting slogans ""We want Justice, take the permission (to build dam on Cauvery) back, Don't deny rights of Tamil Nadu"", disrupting functioning. One of the member said the Government of India has ""shamed"" Tamil Nadu. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Vijay Goel also requested the members from Tamil Nadu to allow the Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari to deliver his statement on the issue. Mr Naidu also said the minister had been called to the House to deliver a statement following the Tamil Nadu members' request and now he should be allowed to do so. However, the members from AIADMK continued their protest in the Well, with four DMK members also joining to associate with them. In the meantime, Mr Naidu said now the minister (Gadkari) would not make a statement. He then asked Home Minister Rajnath Singh to move a resolution to proclaim President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir on December 19, 2018 under Article 356 of the Constitution. Mr Singh tabled the resolution which was already approved in Lok Sabha on December 28, 2018. He delivered his statement amid the din. The Opposition leader Ghulam Nabi Azad was invited to initiate the discussion on the resolution but the Chairman had to briefly adjourn the House. Before adjourning, the Chairman asked the AIADMK and DMK members to leave for the day. When the House resumed, Deputy Chairman Harivansh asked the concerned members to leave the House but they continued to protest. Harivansh said,""In this situation the House is adjourned till 3 PM."" As the House reassembled, DMK and AIADMK Members again trooped into the Well, shouting slogans. ""I am left with no other other alternative than to adjourn the House for the day"", the Deputy Chairman said.

"Gift Scheme Sparks New Row Between Kiran Bedi, Puducherry Chief Minister","Gift Scheme Sparks New Row Between Kiran Bedi, Puducherry Chief Minister",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kiran-bedi-v-narayanasamy-puducherry-chief-minister-in-new-row-over-pongal-gift-scheme-1971170,en,"In a fresh turf war, Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy Tuesday said he has returned a file on Pongal gift hamper scheme to Lt Governor Kiran Bedi, protesting her 'arbitrary' decision to restrict its coverage, a charge rejected by her. He also said the Lt Governor had ""no authority"" to take a decision contrary to the proposal of the government to extend the benefits of the scheme to all ration card holders. ""She is only misusing her authority and acting to the detriment of the people by taking a decision contrary to the proposal of elected government,"" Mr Narayanasamy, who has been at loggerheads with Ms Bedi on various administrative matters, told reporters. Commenting on the issue, Ms Bedi charged Narayanasamy with using public platforms to spread 'false information' and said he was party to a decision taken last year that the scheme would be limited to BPL families only and not applicable to the APL (above poverty line) families. On December 28, while addressing Congress workers at the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) office in Puducherry, Mr Narayanasamy had said though the government decided to distribute Pongal gift hampers for all ration card holders, Ms Bedi returned the file insisting that only BPL families should be covered. The chief minister Tuesday said his cabinet did not accept the 'modification' made by Ms Bedi to the government's proposal. ""When she sent the file to the government with specific contention that only BPL families should be handed the Pongal gifts and those coming under above poverty line (APL) and AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana) categories would not be eligible for it, I had returned the file to her registering our protest against her arbitrary decision,"" he said. The gift hamper comprises essential items like rice, jaggery and cashew nuts required for making 'Pongal' (a sweet delicacy,) offered to Sun God on the occasion of harvest festival, which falls on January 15. Mr Narayanasamy said the Congress government wanted the benefits of the scheme to reach all categories as done in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Ms Bedi's contention that implementation of the scheme would mean heavy expenditure for the government was ""misleading and is an utter lie,"" he alleged. Noting that any difference of opinion between the Lt Governor and the government on implementation of welfare schemes should be referred to the Council of Ministers, Mr Narayanasamy said the former had no authority to adopt a totally ""improper and arbitrary approach."" Charging Ms Bedi with hiding facts to justify her stand, he said she ""does not deserve"" to be the incumbent of the gubernatorial post. Puducherry would witness a ""big change"" sooner than later and all ""current sufferings and embarrassment"" of the people would come to an end, he claimed without elaborating. Reacting to the chief minister's comments, Ms Bedi in a message to the media later said the gift hamper was ""limited to the BPL and red card holders as per the notification published in the state Gazette in January last year.""...the Chief Minister is part of the agreed decision - that the scheme is limited to BPL families and red colour card holders only and that the benefit of the scheme is not applicable to the APL families,"" she said. Ms Bedi also said the expenditure for this scheme would be met from out of the funds earmarked for free rice scheme. When full allocation was not available for the rice scheme, the chief minister would blame the office of Lt Governor for not providing the fund, she added. ""The Chief Minister is regrettably using his public platforms to spread false information all the time. He is violating his own gazette schemes when he demands Pongal gift for the above poverty line categories also,"" she said.

The Uttar Pradesh leader had said that unless the Congress withdrew the cases filed against the innocent persons in the two states, she would ""reconsider"" her support to the party. ""Mayawati had not given a warning, She explained the need to build pressure regarding cases filed against the Dalits,"" Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan told reporters today. The Congress had been on the same side as Mayawati during the all-India strike against the changes in a law meant for prevention of atrocities against the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Both parties had accused the BJP-led Central government of not taking up the cause of Dalits after the Supreme Court had suggested changes that were seen as compromising the safety and security of the community. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had tweeted: ""Our Dalit brothers and sisters are today on the streets demanding protection of their rights from the Modi Government. We salute them."" ""We are already reviewing the cases filed against the Dalits. The legal process takes time. But the matter will be sorted out,"" Mr Vadakkan said. Mayawati, who had ruled out support to the Congress in the run-up to the latest round of assembly elections, had reluctantly backed the party after it failed to gain majority in Madhya Pradesh by a very slim margin. The support of the Uttar Pradesh leader will also be crucial in the coming Lok Sabha elections. Uttar Pradesh sends 80 lawmakers in parliament - higher than any state. Earlier today, Danish Ali, a senior leader of HD Kumaraswamy's Janata Dal Secular, a Congress ally, also underscored the importance of withdrawing the case against Dalits for the April protests. ""We support the stand of Mayawati. Young people from the Dalit community have been victimized in the BJP-ruled states,"" he said.

Lakhs Of Women To Form 620 Km Long 'Women's Wall' In Kerala Today,Lakhs Of Women To Form 620 Km Long 'Women's Wall' In Kerala Today,https://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/lakhs-of-women-to-form-620-km-womens-wall-in-kerala-today-1970785,en,"Lakhs of women from across Kerala are expected to form a 620 km state sponsored 'Women's Wall today to uphold gender equality and renaissance values, in the backdrop of frenzied protests in Sabarimala after the ruling LDF decided to implement the Supreme Court verdict, allowing all women to pray at the Ayyappa shrine. The women will form the wall from Kasargod in northern Kerala to the southernmost district of Thiruvananthapuram. Health minister K K Shylaja will lead the chain at Kasargod and CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat will be the last person at the end of the chain in Thiruvananthapuram. The participants will gather at the designated centers today at 3 PM, where a rehearsal will be held. The Wall will be formed between 4 and 4.15 PM, with participants taking a pledge to uphold gender equality and renaissance values. The proposed wall was suggested at a meeting called by the Kerala government in the backdrop of frenzied protests by right-wing parties and a section of devotees over the state's decision to implement the September 28 top court order, allowing women of all ages to Sabarimala. ""Finding a solution to the issues faced by women is seen as part of the class struggle,"" Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday, adding that ensuring gender equality was part of class struggle. In Marxist ideology, class struggle is the conflict of interests between workers and the ruling class in a capitalist society. ""The protests by communal forces against women's entry in Sabarimala prompted the government and other progressive organisations to build Women's Wall in the state,"" Mr Vijayan had said, adding that all women, cutting across castes and religions, would join the wall ""to save Kerala from the being dragged back into the era of darkness."" The Universal Records Forum, the team which records amazing feats across the globe, is also in the state. The pledge for the wall, released by the Chief Ministers office on Sunday, calls for upholding gender equality and renaissance values. It also bats for secularism and to oppose the move to turn the state into a 'lunatic asylum.' While senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala has described the initiative as a 'wall of contradiction', UDF lawmaker M K Muneer had has termed it as a 'communal' wall for inviting participation only from 'progressive Hindu organisations'. The event is organised by the ruling CPI(M), along with over 176 other socio-political organisations, including the CPI, Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) and Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS). The Nair Service Society (NSS), a prominent caste-based organization, RSS and the right-wing groups have opposed this move. The Kudambashree Mission had earlier informed that it alone will field over 1.25 lakh women on January 1.
