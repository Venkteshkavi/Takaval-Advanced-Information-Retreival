UN agency praises India on minimising loss of life from Cyclone Fani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/un-agency-praises-india-on-minimising-loss-of-life-from-cyclone-fani/articleshow/69172691.cms,"UNITED NATIONS: The UN agency for disaster reduction has commended the Indian Meteorological Department's ""almost pinpoint accuracy"" of early warnings that helped authorities conduct a well-targeted evacuation plan and minimise the loss of life as extremely severe cyclonic storm Fani made landfall near the coastal city ofPuri.The powerful cyclone, strongest to hit India in 20 years, made landfall at around 8am in India's eastern state ofOdisha, killing at least eight people.Large areas in the seaside pilgrim town of Puri and other places were submerged as heavy rains battered the entire coastal belt of the state affecting about 11 lakh people.TheIndia Meteorological Department(IMD) has classified Fani as an ""extremely severe cyclonic storm"".UN agencies are monitoring Fani's movements closely and taking measures to protect families living in refugee camps in Bangladesh, which is on alert.The Cyclone lashed the coast with maximum wind speeds of up to 175 kilometres per hour, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding, with 28 million people living along the route of the massive storm.""India's zero casualty approach to managing extreme weather events is a major contribution to the implementation of the #SendaiFramework and the reduction of loss of life from such events,"" Mami Mizutori, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General (SRSG) for Disaster Risk Reduction, and head of the Geneva-based UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), said.Mizutori was referring to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the first major agreement of the post-2015 development agenda. It is a 15-year, voluntary, non-binding agreement which recognises that the state has the primary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders including the local government, the private sector and other stakeholders.Highlighting the zero-casualty cyclone preparedness policy of the Indian government, a spokesperson for UNISDR, Denis McClean said: ""the almost pinpoint accuracy of the early warnings from the Indian Meteorological Department had enabled the authorities to conduct a well-targeted evacuation plan, which had involved moving more than one million people into storm shelters"".UNISDR also tweeted about the advisory distributed by India's National Disaster Management Authority and local authorities days before Fani made landfall in an effort to minimise loss of life and injury.Local authorities are accommodating evacuees in over 4,000 shelters, including 880 specially designed to withstand cyclones.""Schools were shut, airports closed and transport suspended, and although damage to infrastructure was expected to be severe, there were no reports of any deaths,"" McClean said.According to preliminary reports, eight people have been killed due to the cyclone, which has the potential to cause widespread loss of life.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters that the UN humanitarian agencies in India have met ahead of the storm's arrival to take stock of preparedness measures.With Fani threatening devastation in India and Mozambique still reeling from Cyclone Idai, one of the worst tropical cyclones,Unicefraised alarm about impact of climate change on children.The UN children's agency said the cyclone currently hammering India and the back-to-back cyclones that tore through Mozambique in March and April have caused serious damage to the lives of thousands of children. They should be an urgent wake-up call to world leaders on the serious risks that extreme weather events pose to the lives of children.In Odisha, 28 million people, including 10 million children, are in the path ofCyclone Fani, Unicef said.""Children will bear the brunt of these disasters,"" said Gautam Narasimhan, Unicef Senior Adviser on Climate Change.He said climate change is linked to rising sea levels and the increase in rainfall associated with cyclones, causing more devastation in coastal but also inland areas.""In the short term, the most vulnerable children are at the risk of drowning and landslides, deadly diseases including cholera and malaria, malnutrition from reduced agricultural production, and psychological trauma – all of which are compounded when health centers and schools are impacted,"" he said.Narasimhan warned that in the long term, cycles of poverty can linger for years and limit the capacity of families and communities to adapt to climate change and to reduce the risk of disasters.According to the World Metereological Organization (WMO), the forecast on Friday was that Cyclone Fani ""would move north-northeast towards Bangladesh where there were concerns about the effects of potential coastal flooding"".World Meteorological Organizationspokesperson Clare Nullis said the impact the cyclone is expected to be less severe in areas such as Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar which is home to the world's largest refugee camp, populated mainly by Rohingyas who have fled Myanmar.Meanwhile, Americares, a health-focused relief and development organization, said its India arm Americares India is preparing to deliver medicine and relief supplies to assist survivors, including tarps, water cans and water purification tablets for up to 3,000 families.Americares India Managing Director Shripad Desai said: ""We anticipate thousands of families will need shelter and medical care in the coming days"".Download The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"

Rafale defence deal: Centre files affidavit against review petition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rafale-defence-deal-centre-files-affidavit-against-review-petition/articleshow/69171945.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday filed a fresh affidavit in Rafale deal in theSupreme Court, saying that the well-reasoned order of December 14, 2018, in which the apex court gave a clean chit to the government, could not be relooked merely on the basis of some stolen documents revealing incomplete file notings.The affidavit was filed after the top court issued a formal notice to Centre on review petitions filed against its December-14 judgment on Rafale deal in which it had refused to order a probe into the deal of procuring 36 Rafale fighter jets from France.The Centre told the court that all files relating to the procurement of 36 fully loaded Rafale jets were submitted to CAG, which after a thorough audit has returned a finding that the price is 2.86% cheaper than the proposed deal during UPA government.The Centre accused the review petitioners — Prashant Bhushan,Arun Shourieand Yashwant Sinha — of relying on subsequent information, which are nothing but unsubstantiated media reports and/or part internal file notings deliberately projected in a selective manner and said it cannot form the basis for a review.""A non-existent distinction is sought to be created between an inquiry by the CBI and by the Court by playing on words. Once the Court has held that perceptions of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving inquiry by this Court, there is no basis for a fishing and roving inquiry by the CBI,"" Centre said.On December 14, the Supreme Court had dismissed all petitions seeking court-monitored probe into the Rafale fighter jet deal with France, saying that there was no occasion to doubt the decision-making process in the deal.The top court said it was not its job to go into the issue of pricing. The bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI)Ranjan Gogoi, said that there is no need to conduct an investigation into details of Rafale pricing.Thereafter petitioners in Rafale fighter jet deal case - Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and Prashant Bhushan - in January moved the Supreme Court for review of the Rafale judgment.The petition stated that the verdict contains several errors and also it relies upon patently incorrect claims made by the Government in an unsigned note given in a sealed cover to the court, which is a violation of the principle of natural justice.Download The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"

SC refuses to dilute stringent provisions against pre-natal sex-determination test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-dilute-stringent-provisions-against-pre-natal-sex-determination-test/articleshow/69169609.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that a fall in sex ratio has not only demographic impact, but also leads to trafficking of women and bride-buying, the Supreme Court on Friday refused to dilute stringent provisions of the PNDT Act under which a medical practitioner could be sent to jail for up to three years for even anomalies in paperwork and not keeping records of patients.A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Vineet Saran dismissed a petition filed by Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) which challenged the validity of Sections 23(1) and 23(2) of Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act which says that criminal proceedings would be initiated against geneticist or gynaecologist in case of any violation of the Act and their registration could be suspended indefinitely during the pendency of trial.The Federation said the law was being misused as criminal cases were being launched even in cases of clerical errors in maintaining records of patients and pleaded that the provision should be read down and licence of doctors should be suspended only after conviction under the Act. It said authorities seal the sonography machine and file a criminal case even if there were mere anomalies in paperwork.“Suspension of medical licence at the stage of framing of charges is highly improper and harsh, which results in loss of livelihood of not only the members of the Society (FOGSI), but also their dependents ... The provision is unconstitutional as it assumes the guilt of an alleged accused even before conviction,” it contended.The court, however, refused its plea and said, “Considering the evils sought to be remedied it cannot be said that the imposition in the Act in question is disproportionate. The restrictions and the provisions of punishment have close nexus with the object sought to be achieved. It is not possible to term action as merely clerical one as that is pre-requisite for the test/procedure and that is what is intended by the Act, if it is given a go-bye under the guise of clerical error, the Act would be rendered otiose”.Referring toUnited Nationsreport, the court said that more than 4.6 lakh girls went missing at birth on an average annually during the period 2001-12 as a result of sex selective abortions and justifies the stringent provisions under the Act to maintain sex ratio and social balance in the society.Download The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"

The survey was conducted in India during October-December 2018.He said it is clear that Rahul Gandhi concocts falsehood, as in the Rafale case, starts believing his falsehood to be true and eventually dreams that the falsehood has destroyed his opponent. “He does not gauge public opinion.

It may well turn out to be a revenge against the Congress,” the FM added.Addressing a press conference, Union ministerPiyush Goyalsaid Rahul visited Amethi like a “tourist” and Congress had “betrayed” the constituency by keeping it mired in poverty and underdevelopment.

It also asked retired SC judge A K Sikri to randomly check answer sheets of the 1,195 candidates who took the main examination.In response to an advertisement issued by the Punjab and Haryana HC in March 2017 inviting candidates to appear in a three-stage screening-cum-examination system — preliminary, main and interview — 34,000 law graduates applied for 109 posts of civil judge (junior division), which is the entry-level post in judiciary. In August 2017, the number of posts was reduced to 107.Of those who applied, 32,230 were found eligible to take the preliminary examination. The exam was held nine months after the date of advertisement and only 14,231 took the preliminary test. On January 16 this year, the HC shortlisted 1,451 candidates from among those who appeared. Of the shortlisted ones, 1,282 candidates were found eligible to appear for the main exam conducted by Haryana Public Service Commission.The main examination was held on March 15 and 1,195 candidates appeared for it. On April 11, the results were declared and just nine were picked for the interview. The final stage of the recruitment process is not complete and yet more than 99% of candidates who appeared for the test have been eliminated.Thus, out of 34,000 who applied, only 0.026% were held eligible for the interview, and out of 14,231 who actually appeared in the preliminary examination, only 0.06% succeeded in getting through the two-tier process and went through to the interview round.After a petition brought the matter to its notice, the SC sought a response from the Punjab and Haryana HC and asked its registrargeneralto be present in court.On Friday, senior advocate Maninder Singh and advocate PrabhasBajajappeared for the HC and gave statistical details of the examination to a bench of Chief JusticeRanjan Gogoiand Justice Deepak Gupta.

Strange for an RSS pracharak, who preaches that our epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata replete with conflicts and violent wars is the only source of our history,” Yechury said describing Modi’s remark as “amazing”.Yechury’s comments drew a sharp rebuttal from BJP leader Subramanian Swamy who said the CPM chief’s remarks were laughable because he represented a party that believed in “revolutionary violence” and was now espousing non-violence. Swamy also said Hindus don’t believe in violence, but cited instances from both Mahabharata and Ramayana to assert Hindus don’t step back from “retaliatory violence” when provoked.“We demand an apology from him by trying to defame the Hindu religion and spreading lies and hate against Hindu epics and scriptures that have promoted noble values like victory of good over the evil, universal brotherhood and non-violence,” BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao said in a statement.Calling Modi’s comments as “venomous communal polarisation”, Yechury said Ashoka, the king of the Mauryan empire embracedBuddhismafter being remorseful for his bloody conquest of Kalinga. “It is only after denouncingHinduismand adopting Buddhism thatAshokafound his reverence for life through tolerance, compassion and peaceful co-existence,” Yechury said.“In fact, his symbol Chakra today occupies a place of pride on our tri-colour National Flag. It was his four lion stupa that is India’s official symbol. The RSS/BJP behavior today is the complete opposite of what is inscribed on stupas,” he added.Swamy, however, dismissed Yechury’s allegations as ridiculous and said the opposition was floundering because BJP’s “Hindutva” was upsetting all their calculations and even took a dig at Sitaram Yechury’s first name.In the editorial, Yechury attacked RSS ideologue Vinayak Savarkar because he tried to “Hinduize the military and militarise the Hindus’ and targeted Pragya Thakur, BJP’s Bhopal nominee, for disrespecting martyred police officer Hemant Karkare and alleged that after the initial phases of elections, BJP has resorted to the “coreHindutvaagenda” of abolition of Articles 35A and section 370, construction of Ram Mandir on the disputed site,Uniform Civil Codeand National Register of Citizens.Download The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"
CCTV footage exposes serial rapes of minors by retired executive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cctv-footage-exposes-serial-rapes-of-minors-by-retired-executive/articleshow/69169359.cms,"MEERUT: A clutch of CCTV footages, purportedly showing a 63-year-old retired insurance executive Vimal Chand sexually exploiting several minor girls at his upscaleMeerutresidence, came to the fore sending shockwaves in the region and prompting police to file three FIRs and nab the accused. By late Thursday night, Meerut police was able to trace six victims, some as young as ten years.Police claimed that the accused would lure these young girls, mostly from poor families, when the latter approached him for work. “He would call these girls in the name of hiring domestic help. He would later provide them food, clothes and financial help,” Meerut SSP Nitin Tiwari said.Painted in fluorescent yellow, the “house of horror” where Chand lived was famous in Meerut’s Jagriti Vihar locality as the place where poor children got treats for free.“After his wife passed away a few years ago, he began to visit a local temple here and started feeding young poor girls. Not just this, he often used to give money and clothes to them. Happy over freebies, these children started lining outside his house where he would serve them food and give them money and clothes,” said Soma Pal, owner of a dairy which Chand frequented for buying provisions.Chand retired in 2016 as an assistant administrative officer fromHapur. His wife, also a retired executive, passed away the same year. Their daughter is settled abroad.A CCTV technician, who stumbled on the footages while repairing the cameras, blew the lid off the scandal whose proportion has shocked the region. According to police sources, he has been sexually exploiting these young girls for the past two years and more skeletons will tumble out of the closet once the investigation gathers momentum.“Police took cognizance of the matter as soon as information was received. It is a very sensitive matter and police are dealing with it,” the Meerut SSP said.Three FIRs have been registered in the incident and the main accused, Vimal Chand, and CCTV technician Ashu Kashyap, who tried to extort money from Chand, have been arrested.It all began after CCTV technician Kashyap grew suspicious of Chand after he got over a dozen CCTV cameras installed last year covering every section of his house, including bedroom, living room and even the bathroom. Police have prima facie called it “an act of perversion”. “The most likely explanation of installing CCTV cameras inside rooms is that he watched his act afterwards,” SSP Tiwari said.The heinous crime came as a surprise to the neighbours who are in a state of shock and disbelief. “Most of us are unable to understand how such horrible things could be happening around us and we did not have a whiff of it. We thought that the girls were his maids but did not know there was something else going on in his house,” said a resident who did not wish to be identified.On Friday, Chand was attacked by a group of lawyers in premises of a local court where local police produced him. “We are seeking his police custody to get to the bottom of this case and ensure justice to the girls who have been wronged,” the SSP said.Download The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"
Why Jharkhand’s Pathalgarhi villages plan to vote in fight for autonomy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-jharkhands-pathalgarhi-villages-plan-to-vote-in-fight-for-autonomy/articleshow/69169926.cms,"KHUNTI: The undulating roads of Khunti are dotted with huge stone slabs, painted green with white text, claiming the tribal communities’ right to self-rule. The Pathalgarhis (stone plaques) have been in place for two years, delegitimising the rule of any elected government over tribal land. But now, before Khunti votes in theLok Sabhaelections on May 6, the movement has changed tenor, and strategy.Older Pathalgarhis, set up in 2017, have switched from Hindi to Mundari, asserting in even stronger terms the tribals’ claim to autonomy. These go back to older precedents, referring to the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act and Mundari Khuntkatti (a lineage-based system of collective landholding by tribal communities). Pathalgarhis erected in 2018 have stuck to Hindi, declaring “India Non Judicial” and dismissing voter cards and Aadhaar cards as “anti-Adivasi” documents.At Laterjang, which set up its Pathalgarhi in 2017, freshly painted wall graffiti repeats these statements — “Lok Sabha na Vidhan Sabha, sab se ooncha Gram Sabha (not Lok Sabha or assembly, gram sabha is the highest authority)” — but other messages make the political climate clear. One sarcastic take says, “Adivasi log gehri neend mein soye huye the.Raghubar DasaurNarendra Modine milkar MomentumJharkhandlaaya to yahaan paanchvi anusuchi ka bhoot nikal gaya. Bahut achchha kiya Raghubar Modi ne isliye CM ko bahut bahut dhanyavaad (Adivasis were in deep slumber. CM Raghubar Das and PM Modi together brought investors’ summit Momentum Jharkhand and destroyed the spirit of the Fifth Schedule. We thank the CM),” says another.In the next lane, as Congress workers distribute NYAY enrolment forms and put up party flags, there is no resistance.Just like Laterjang, Kochang — a stronghold of the Pathalgarhi movement — has decided to participate in the elections. A year ago, Kochang shot to the headlines after an alleged gang-rape in which Pathalgarhi supporters were implicated. Several arrests followed, including that of a cardinal at the Burudih church. While the government accused the movement of fostering criminal elements, Pathalgarhi supporters saw it as a conspiracy against them.A week ago, a Congress party office was set up opposite the Pathalgarhi. “Everyone here will vote, just to replace the present government. Under Pathalgarhi, we do not believe in elections, but the kind of repression we faced forced us to change our strategy,” says Kali Munda, a Pathalgarhi leader at Kochang. “The government has tried to take away the rights of indigenous people across the country. It has tried to divide Christians and Sarnas (followers of animism), but we don’t believe we’re different.”Beyond Kochang, the villages of Sakey and Saali are still holding their ground against elections, as is Udburu, the first Pathalgarhi village to set up its own banking system. Just like Kochang, Udburu saw a massive crackdown on its leaders last year.Areas around arterial roads, like Chitramu or Burudih, have either pulled down the Pathalgarhi or painted over it. Chitramu pulled down its plaque last year, with a ceremony marked by funerary rituals. “Government officials told us we will get access to development schemes if the Pathalgarhi is removed,” says Kishun Swasi, a village elder. Others simply don’t want any more trouble. “We will vote and see if anything changes for us,” says a villager at Alhaudi, where the Pathalgarhi still stands at the village square and has been painted over, but not enough to render the text illegible.Download The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"
"Cyclone kills 6 in Odisha, leaves trail of destruction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cyclone-kills-6-in-odisha-leaves-trail-of-destruction/articleshow/69169340.cms,"At least six persons were killed and hundreds rendered homeless as Cyclone Fani hitOdishaon Friday morning, making landfall nearPuriand unleashing its full force with wind speed going up to 175 kmph. Though various government authorities confirmed six deaths, PTI put the toll at 8.The cyclone made landfall south of Puri coast around 8 am and then got into Khurda district, of which Bhubaneswar is a part, triggering heavy rainfall along its way, weather officials said. Fani hit Bengal after 10.30 pm, hitting the Digha coast with a peak wind speed of 115 kmph. It was scheduled to enter Kolkata’s neighbourhood via Kharagpur with a wind speed of up to 80kmph a little after midnight. It will exit Bengal through Nadia and Murshidabad on Saturday afternoon and sail towards Bangladesh.According to Central Water Commission (CWC) officials, Odisha, Bengal,Andhra Pradeshand Assam face a high risk of “receiving extremely heavy rain” in the wake of Fani.The cyclone lashed Odisha’s capital Bhubaneswar for five hours with wind speed of over 100 kmph, damaging power and telecommunication lines. Most arterial roads in the city were blocked by uprooted trees and many low-lying areas remained inundated. It could take up to three days to restore power supply completely in Bhubaneswar. Telecom network was broken down in Puri and Bhubaneswar while it suffered partial damage in other parts of the state.Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik said Puri town and district had suffered huge damage. ""Energy infrastructure has been completely destroyed. Restoration of electricity is a challenging task,” he said.“We have engaged about 5,000 personnel to restore power supply. We have kept about 15,000 electric poles ready to replace the damaged ones,” special relief commissioner (SRC) Bishunupada Sethi said.Officials said more than 200 trains on the Kolkata-Chennai route that pass through Odisha were cancelled. More than 10,000 villages and 52 towns in nine districts of Odisha were affected as heavy rain pounded the state all through the day. Paddy and other crops were severely damaged in coastal districts due to flooding.Officials confirmed three deaths in Bhubaneswar and one each in Puri, Kendrapada and Nayagarh districts.Sethi said the cyclone uprooted numerous trees as it swept through Puri, Khurda and Ganjam districts, disrupting movement of vehicles. Several houses were damaged in these three districts, with Puri bearing the maximum brunt of the calamity.In Bengal, government sent out quick response teams to various districts and kept nine disaster management teams ready for Kolkata. Civic authorities arranged for evacuation of residents from unsafe buildings in Kolkata.Assam disaster management minister Bhabesh Kalita said all deputy commissioners of districts where heavy rain was forecast were told to put in place disaster mitigation measures. “Our state disaster management response force (SDRF) and national disaster management response force (NDRF) teams are on alert,” Kalita said.SDRF personnel are placed in 40 locations across Assam and NDRF teams have been sent to six locations in Cachar, Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Sonitpur, Tinsukia and Jorhat districts.The Army said the Eastern Air Command has kept medium-lift helicopters at Kumbhigram airport inSilcharas standby for rescue operations in Tripura, Mizoram,Manipurand Nagaland.In Andhra, there was some damage to crops and houses in the coastalSrikakulam districtbut the magnitude was far less compared to cyclone Titli which hit the district in October 2018.Download The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"
"New warning system, smooth evacuation limit casualties due to Fani's fury",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-warning-system-smooth-evacuation-limit-casualties-due-to-fanis-fury/articleshow/69169094.cms,"NEW DELHI/BHUBANESWAR: CoastalOdishaon Friday faced the wrath of “extremely severe” cyclonic storm ‘Fani’, but India Meteorological Department’s improved warning system, successful evacuation of lakhs of people, better Centre-state coordination and the highest ever deployment by NDRF limited casualties. The government officially put the death toll at six, though news agencies reported eight deaths.It was not that the areas in the path of ‘Fani’ escaped unscathed. There was extensive damage to kuccha houses in Puri, 160 persons were admitted to hospital for treatment, the residence of the SP and DM were badly damaged and there was a serious disruption of power supply.However, IMD's new regional hurricane model, which is part of India’s ‘zero casualty’ focus on cyclones, helped avert a higher toll and showed how accuracy in tracking and forecasting landfall has progressed since the 1999 super cyclone that killed close to 10,000 people, flattened thousands of dwellings and devastated hundreds of square km of countryside.After success in responding to the more recent Phailin (October 2013) and Hudhud (October 2014) cyclones, central agencies and state governments were able to manage a massive evacuation. Repeated warnings reduced casualties at sea and infrastructure by way of storm bunkers was available, particularly in states like Odisha andAndhra Pradeshthat are seen to be more vulnerable.Local disaster management authorities in Odisha and theNational Disaster Response Force(NDRF) were on their toes ahead of Fani’s landfall. The NDRF, in fact, made its highest ever deployment by putting 65 teams (one team consists of 45 personnel) on the ground with 38 in Odisha. Over 11.5 lakh people were evacuated in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal in the past three days. Additional teams for road clearance, law and order and dry food have been rushed.IMD’s systems came in for praise. “It’s a very significant achievement for IMD. I wrote a congratulatory note to its director general (K J Ramesh) today for averting a major crisis. The department has successfully used its regional hurricane model in addition to other existing models,” said Madhavan Rajeevan, ministry of earth sciences’ (MoES) secretary.Rajeevan told TOI that the new regional model, having ocean components in addition to atmospheric ones in other models, could track the cyclone better. “Review of existing system will be done on May 13 as the forecast agency wants to further improve its cyclone early warning system,” Rajeevan said.The preparations were on a war footing. Three Army columns were on standby in Gopalpur and elements of the engineering task force in Panagarh. Similarly, the Army was in readiness inSecunderabad, Barrackpore, Kolkata and Kankinara. The Navy deployed six ships for relief operations while medical and diving teams were on alert. The IAF kept two C-17s, two C-130s and four AN-32s on standby.Having learnt from experience, local authorities had stockpiled foodstuff for emergency use while government and private hospitals geared up with more staff on duty and medicines and beds.The highest number of 2.81 lakh people were evacuated from Ganjam and 4,852 cyclone and flood shelters were identified. Two choppers were on standby for immediate rescue and air dropping of relief material. Odisha has installed an early warning system to ensure last mile connectivity through voice messaging and blowing of sirens.The improved warning systems have earned international praise too. The UN office for Disaster Risk Reduction had taken note of how disaster management authorities, with support of IMD, “acted with speed” to order evacuation of up to 4 lakh people ahead of ‘Hudhud’.IMD has been able to reduce its 24-hour forecast error in track prediction from 137km during 2007-11 to 97km during 2012-16. Similarly, its ‘landfall error’ during the period reduced from 101km to 56km.As per the latest IMD update, ‘Fani’ crossed the Odisha coast close to Puri with maximum sustained wind speed of 175-185 kmph, gusting to 205 kmph, from 8-10 am on Friday.“It (Fani) is very likely to emerge into Gangetic West Bengal as a severe cyclonic storm with wind speed of 90-100 kmph, gusting to 115 kmph, by early Saturday morning. It is very likely to move further north-northeastwards and emerge intoBangladeshon Saturday evening as a cyclonic storm with wind speed of 60-70 kmph, gusting to 80 kmph,” IMD said.Cyclone ‘Fani’ is only the second storm in the past over 126 years to form over the Bay of Bengal and cross India’s mainland in April. The last severecyclone Nargis, formed in April over the Bay of Bengal, had devastatedMyanmarin 2008. Only 14 severe tropical cyclones have, so far, formed in April over the Bay of Bengal in the 1891-2017 period.In Video:Cyclone Fani causes damage to infrastructure, uprooted trees in India’s east coastDownload The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"
11 girls missing from Bihar shelter home likely murdered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/11-girls-missing-from-bihar-shelter-home-likely-murdered/articleshow/69169363.cms,"NEW DELHI: The grim story of Muzaffarpur’s “house of horrors” has got bleaker. The CBI told the Supreme Court on Friday that its investigation and questioning have revealed that 11 girls from the notorious shelter home are missing and are feared to have been killed.The CBI probe into the home run by main accusedBrajesh Thakur, who flaunted his connections, makes for a depressing account of helpless young girls, invariably from poor backgrounds, not missed even in death. The inmates, who have spoken of sexual exploitation and missing girls, have given CBI 11 names.In an affidavit, the CBI said rape survivors spoke of the girls who were said to have been killed by Thakur. It said it is verifying the allegations and divulged that it has excavated a bundle of bones from a location where a girl was apparently buried by the accused, adding it has not yet invoked murder charges as the investigation is in progress.The possible deaths have seen the CBI scrutinising details in the shelter home records where it found 35 girls with identical or similar names, who at one time or the other were at the Balikagrih.“The victims during their examination in the presence of experts of Nimhans had revealed names of 11 girls who were allegedly murdered by Brajesh Thakur and his accomplices. These allegations are being duly investigated in the right earnest in the instant case by scrutinising the master register maintained at the Balikagrih to locate the bodies and through field-level verification as to the existence of the girls alleged to be murdered,” the affidavit said.Refuting the allegation that it was trying to protect influential people by not invoking murder charges, the CBI said the identification of victims was still on and any allegation of questioning the agency’s motives was misplaced.The agency’s affidavit came on an application by social activist Nivedita Jha who alleged that the CBI was trying to protect Thakur and other accused despite the statements of victims. The petition, filed through advocate Fauzia Shakil, said the investigation conducted by the CBI was not only “incomplete but ex facie also appeared to be hogwash”.Responding to allegations that it had not booked outsiders who visited the shelter home and raped the victims, the affidavit said, “All efforts were made to trace the perpetrators of crime. After ascertaining the identity of perpetrators through proper investigation, a chargesheet has been filed against them. Investigations regarding the outsiders have been properly carried out and a chargesheet filed against all such persons.”The petitioner alleged that victims in their statements before the judicial magistrate had made reference to one “tondwale uncle netaji” (politician with a paunch) and to a “moochwale uncleji” (uncle with moustache) who used to visit the shelter home but the agency had not tried to find them.“It is evident from the statement of the victims that a large-scale prostitution racket was being run by Brajesh Thakur. From the perusal of the chargesheet, it is apparent that the CBI is trying to shield the real perpetrators and has intentionally avoided to investigate the leads given by the victims,” the petitioner said.The petition said it is unclear from the chargesheet whether identity sketches have been prepared by the CBI on the basis of physical description of the perpetrators given by the victims.Read this story in BengaliDownload The Times of IndiaNews Appfor LatestIndiaNews.#ElectionsWithTimesTOI Campaign  TrackerData StoriesPoll  ShotsOpinion"
