Paris Police Clash With Protesters Ahead Of May Day March,Paris Police Clash With Protesters Ahead Of May Day March,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-police-clash-with-protesters-ahead-of-may-day-march-2031459,en,"Paris riot police fired teargas as they squared off against hardline demonstrators among tens of thousands of May Day protesters, who flooded the city Wednesday in a test for France's zero-tolerance policy on street violence. Tensions were palpable as a heady mix of labour unionists, ""yellow vest"" demonstrators and anti-capitalists gathered in the French capital, putting security forces on high alert. Ahead of the main march, the city was on lockdown with more than 7,400 police and gendarmes deployed with orders from President Emmanuel Macron to take an ""extremely firm stance"" if faced with violence. Clashes briefly erupted on Montparnasse Boulevard, where hundreds of anti-capitalist ""black bloc"" activists pushed to the front of the gathering crowd, hurling bottles and other projectiles at police, who fired tear gas and stingball grenades, an AFP correspondent said. Used at ground level, the grenades release scores of rubber pellets that cause an intense stinging to the legs. Authorities had warned this year's marches would likely spell trouble, coming barely a week after leaders of the yellow vest anti-government movement angrily dismissed a package of tax cuts by President Emmanuel Macron. And with some agitators vowing on social media to turn Paris into ""the capital of rioting"", the government moved to deploy security on an ""exceptional scale"" throughout the capital. Last year, officials were caught off guard by some 1,200 troublemakers who ran amok in Paris, vandalising businesses and clashing with police. By early afternoon, thousands had flocked to the Montparnasse area, many wearing the hi-visibility jackets that gave the name to the yellow vest protesters. Since November, the city has struggled to cope with the weekly yellow vest protests, which have often descended into chaos with a violent minority smashing up and torching shops, restaurants and newspaper stands. Across the city on Wednesday, streets were barricaded and shops had boarded up their windows, with police ordering the closure of all businesses along the route of the main march. ""We are not afraid of the union marches but of the black blocs,"" local restaurant owner Serge Tafanel told AFP. ""Capital of rioting"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said several groups on social media had urged protesters to transform Paris into ""the capital of rioting"", with police gearing up for the arrival of up to 2,000 activists bristling for a fight. Many are anti-capitalist youths, often known as black blocs, who dress in black and wear face masks. Nearly 200 motorcycle units have been deployed across the capital to respond quickly to flare-ups of violence, and drones are being used to track protesters' movements. Castaner said police would carry out pre-emptive searches of anyone planning to march, a new tactic allowed under a security law passed recently in response to the yellow vest violence. From the early hours of Wednesday, several dozen police officers could be seen at the city's main train stations, carrying out bag random searches, AFP journalists said. By early afternoon, police said 165 people had been detained for questioning. Sidelined, unions seek visibility Last Thursday, in a major policy speech aimed at calming the yellow vest anger, Macron promised a string of reforms including tax cuts worth five billion euros ($5.5 billion). The yellow vests rejected it as too little, too late, pledging to keep up the protests, which began last year over rising taxes on fuel and pensions but have since morphed into a wider movement. Although the numbers have steadily fallen, the rallies have remained in the headlines, largely over disorder by a handful of violent protesters along the Champs-Elysees. Following a particularly violent demo in March, the government adopted a ""zero-tolerance"" approach, passing an ""anti-rioter"" bill which included making it a criminal offence to wear a mask at a protest. France's powerful labour unions are also hoping to use the traditional May Day march for workers' rights to raise their profile after finding themselves sidelined for months by the grass-roots yellow vest movement. Like the yellow vests, the unions were also disappointed by Macron's speech. ""We must be careful not to lose the meaning of this day,"" warned Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the CGT, one of France's biggest unions. ""It is a day of mobilisation which deserves our full attention after Emmanuel Macron's announcement in which he said: 'I hear you and I'm not changing anything'.""

Addressing a rally in Bihar's Kishanganj, a Muslim-dominated constituency where his party has put up its own candidate, the firebrand Hyderabad Lok Sabha lawmaker said, ""I had warned you people during the 2015 assembly polls not to be fooled by the promises of the so-called Mahagathbandhan. You did not pay heed and ended up voting for Nitish Kumar who is now sitting in the BJP's lap."" ""You must not repeat the same mistake again when haath (Congress poll symbol) wallahs are again seeking your votes with nothing more to offer other than the fear of BJP. You must not forget this party was in power in Bihar as well as at the centre when the Bhagalpur riots took place and when the premises of the Babri Masjid were unlocked,"" Mr Owaisi said. ""You must also ask the Congress why it stopped its own late MP Asrarul Haque, who represented this constituency, from speaking on the triple talaq debate on the floor of the Parliament,"" he said. ""BJP president Amit Shah is openly threatening to drive out your community from Assam in the name of implementing the National Registry for Citizens. And all we hear from the Congress is breast beating with the refrain what can we do. We have only one MP from the state,"" Mr Owaisi remarked sarcastically. ""Are they unmindful of the power of one. A tiger roams around alone and still rules the jungle. And God Almighty is also one,"" the fiery orator said with his trademark flourish. Training his guns at Nitish Kumar, Mr Owaisi said the Bihar Chief Minister had immense love for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two make a pair as perfect as that of Laila and Majnu. Notably, Mr Kumar had snapped his 17-year-old ties with the BJP in 2013 expressing disagreement with the party projecting Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate. After the Mahagathbandhan, which came into being when he joined hands with arch rival Lalu Yadav's RJD and the Congress, trounced the NDA in 2015 assembly polls, he again returned to the BJP-led coalition in 2017. ""The Seemanchal region (north-eastern Bihar, bordering West Bengal and Bangladesh) has been neglected by all those who have represented this region in elected bodies. Give your votes to our candidate Akhtar-ul-Imam. He will ensure the regions well-being single-handedly on the lines of the solitary battle I am waging on the triple talaq issue,"" Mr Owaisi added.

""I condemn Pragya Thakur's statement. If this is her start, where will its end take them,"" Mr Nath had said.

Journalist Shot Dead In Northern Ireland In 'Terrorist Incident': Police,Journalist Shot Dead In Northern Ireland In 'Terrorist Incident': Police,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/woman-shot-dead-in-northern-irelands-londonderry-in-terrorist-incident-police-2025389,en,"A journalist was shot dead during riots in Northern Ireland in what police Friday were treating as a terrorist incident following the latest upsurge in violence to shake the troubled region. ""Lyra McKee was murdered during orchestrated violence in Creggan last night,"" Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said in a statement. McKee had earlier posted an image that appeared to be from the riots in the Creggan housing estate in the city of Londonderry, also known as Derry, accompanied by the words ""Derry tonight. Absolute madness."" Images of the unrest posted on social media showed a car and van ablaze and hooded individuals throwing petrol bombs and fireworks at police vehicles. ""A single gunman fired shots in a residential area of the city and as a result wounded Ms McKee,"" said Hamilton, adding that police believed the gunman was a ""violent dissident republican."" ""We are treating this as a terrorist incident and we have launched a murder enquiry,"" he added. Journalist Matthew Hughes earlier identified the dead woman as one of his friends. ""I just received the heartbreaking news that my friend @LyraMcKee was murdered tonight in a terrorist incident in Derry,"" he wrote on Twitter. McKee had written for The Atlantic magazine and Buzzfeed News and was named by Forbes Magazine in 2016 as one of their ""30 under 30"" oustanding figures in media, according to her literary agent Janklow & Nesbit. Leona O'Neill, a reporter with the Belfast Telegraph, said she had been next to McKee when she was shot. ""I was standing beside this young woman when she fell beside a police Land Rover tonight in Creggan #Derry. I called an ambulance for her but police put her in the back of their vehicle and rushed her to hospital where she died. Just 29 years old. Sick to my stomach tonight,"" she tweeted. Good Friday Agreement The violence came in the run-up to the Easter weekend, when Republicans opposed to the British presence in Northern Ireland mark the anniversary of a 1916 uprising against British rule. A car-bombing and the hijacking of two vans in Londonderry earlier this year were also blamed on a dissident paramilitary group. Michelle O'Neill, the deputy leader of Irish republican party Sinn Fein, condemned the killing. ""My heart goes out to the family of the young woman shot dead by so-called dissidents,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""This was an attack on the community, an attack on the peace process and an attack on the Good Friday Agreement,"" the peace deal that largely brought an end to violence on the island exactly 21 years ago, she added, calling for calm. Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Union Party, which is in favour of Britain's presence in Northern Ireland, described the death as ""heartbreaking news"". ""A senseless act. A family has been torn apart. Those who brought guns onto our streets in the 70s, 80s & 90s were wrong. It is equally wrong in 2019. No one wants to go back,"" she wrote on Twitter. The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 largely brought an end to three decades of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland between republican and unionist paramilitaries, as well as British armed forces, in a period known as ""the Troubles"". Some 3,500 people were killed in the conflict -- many at the hands of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Police have blamed a group called the New IRA for the flare-up in violence in recent months. Some have expressed fears that recent attacks could be a sign that paramilitaries are seeking to exploit the current political turbulence over Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland caused by Brexit. Londonderry was the scene of one of the darkest episodes in the Troubles in 1972, known as Bloody Sunday, when British troops opened fire on a civil rights demonstration and killed 13 people. A 14th victim later died of his wounds. A former British soldier was charged with murder last month over the killings.

Supreme Court To Hear Sajjan Kumar's Bail Plea In August,Supreme Court To Hear Sajjan Kumar's Bail Plea In August,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/1984-anti-sikh-riots-case-supreme-court-to-hear-sajjan-kumars-bail-plea-in-august-2023457,en,"The Supreme Court today said it would hear in the first week of August the bail application of former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, who was awarded life term by the Delhi High Court in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. The CBI told a bench of Justices S A Bobde and S A Nazeer that offence for which Kumar was convicted was of ""gruesome nature"" as it was a ""genocide"". Kumar, 73, who is lodged in jail , had resigned from the Congress party after he was convicted by the High court. The case in which he was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment's Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II. Anti-Sikh riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards. Kumar has also challenged in the top court the Delhi High Court's verdict of December 17 last year that awarded him life imprisonment for the ""remainder of his natural life"" in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. During the hearing Monday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, told the top court that Kumar is facing trial in another 1984 anti-Sikh riots case at the Patiala House district court. Mr Mehta said recording of evidence was going on in the case and out of 35 prosecution witnesses, seven have been examined till date. The counsel representing Kumar said the former Congress leader was granted anticipatory bail by the high court in the case in which trial is going on and it was affirmed by the top court also. ""This will have to be heard fully,"" the bench said. When Kumar's counsel said that hearing on bail plea would not take much time, Mehta said, ""See the gruesome nature of offence. It was a genocide."" The bench said it would hear the matter in the first week of August. On April 8, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had opposed his bail plea and claimed in the court that Kumar was the ""kingpin"" of a gruesome offence in which Sikhs were ""massacred"" in Delhi during 1984 riots. However, the counsel representing Kumar had said that the former Congress leader was in jail for the past more than three months and during the adjudication of the trial, he was out on anticipatory bail and never misused the liberty. Kumar had surrendered before a trial court here on December 31, 2018, to serve the sentence in pursuance of the high court''s December 17 verdict. The high court had convicted and sentenced Kumar to spend the remainder of his life in jail for the offences of criminal conspiracy and abetment in commission of crimes of murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony and defiling and destruction of a Gurdwara. It had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by a trial court to five others - former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and ex-lawwmakers Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. The high court had set aside the trial court's 2010 verdict, which had acquitted Kumar in the case.

""It is a big deal for me"" said the woman, adding that her case ""is about the shameful failure of the state in protecting its people"". Only 21 years old and five months' pregnant, Bilkis Bano was gang-raped by three men and watched her family being slaughtered. Her three-year-old daughter's head was smashed with a rock. It was one of the most brutal instances of the carnage that started after the Sabarmati Express fire at Godhra. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court instructed the Gujarat government to pay Bilkis Bano an ""exemplary compensation"" of 50 lakh and provide her with a job and a house. ""I am happy with the Supreme Court's judgment. I give credence to the judges who have seen what I have done and acknowledged what has happened to me,"" Bilkis Bano said, speaking with the help of a translator. April 23 was a landmark day for Bilkis Bano in more ways than one. For the first time since her ordeal began, she was able to vote - a task the rest of the country takes for granted. It was a fallout of her fight for justice. Over the 10 years, she changed 30 homes, keeping constantly on the move to ensure the safety of her family. The trial - moving from Ahmedabad to Mumbai and then to New Delhi, from trial courts to the Supreme Court - involved fighting past threats and attempts at intimidation. ""We lived in fear, wondering when someone will come and do something,"" said her husband, who was present at this evening's press conference. Bilkis Bano cast her vote in Gujarat's Dahod constituency, where the BJP's Jasvantsinh Sumanbhai Bhabhor is up against Congress candidate Babubhai Katara. But despite all odds, she says she never wavered from her goal. ""How could I get tired? My entire family, my daughter was killed,"" she said. The court's order is Bano's chance of starting a new life. But she is also aware that while the judgment is in her name and the money will come into her account, there are other women engaged in similar fights. Asked what she would do with the money, she replied, ""I will give some of it to the women who have gone through similar ordeals for their fight and the education of their kids"". She said she wanted to create a fund in the memory of her murdered daughter Saleha, who did not even receive a proper burial. ""I always had faith, even though it was a long fight, in the justice system and the constitution,"" she added.

While terror attacks shook the nation during the Congress regime, the NDA's policy halted it, he said at Ramanathapuram. A vote for DMK, Congress, and Muslim League combine would lead to higher taxes and less development and give a free hand to terrorists and rise of criminal elements in politics, he alleged. ""Those who cannot protect India can never develop the nation. When Congress and their allies were in power, terrorists were attacking the nation regularly. City after city, there were blasts but congress remained helpless and silent,"" he said. But time has changed now, he said, adding: ""India will not spare a single terrorist. If they dare to attack us, we will find them wherever they are and ruin their happiness,"" he said. Addressing a poll rally in Tamil Nadu's Theni, he alleged the Congress and dishonesty were best friends but sometimes ""by mistake,"" they end up speaking the truth. ""Now they are saying "" Ab Hoga Nyay "" (justice will be done now) even if they did not intend, they have admitted that all they have done is "" Anyay "" or injustice for 60 long years,"" (during the Congress rule), he said. ""I want to ask the Congress party who will do Nyay to the victims of 1984 anti-Sikh riots? ...who will do Nyay to all the victims of anti Dalit (violence), who will do Nyay to the government of great MG Ramachandran ji, which was dismissed by the Congress just because one family did not like those leaders."" ""...who will do Nyay to the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy, among the worst environmental disaster in India."" Congress, which talks about ''Nyay'' has done most injustice to regional aspirations by ""shamelessly,"" imposing Article 356 to dismiss state governments of MG Ramachandran, M Karunanidhi, communists and showing disrespect to the federal structure, PM Modi said. PM Modi highlighted how his government believed in ""cooperative and competitive federalism,"" and that regional aspirations mattered in policies. Blaming the DMK and Congress for vote bank politics in opposing a Bill on abolishing Triple Talaq in Parliament, PM Modi said, ""These parties do not believe in dignity of women."" PM Modi referred to the legacy of late AIADMK leaders MGR and J Jayalalithaa. He hailed MGR and Jayalalithaa as iconic leaders who strove for the poor. BJP stood with people on the Lord Ayyappa issue, he said and hailed the state's spiritual ethos by citing the famous hill shrine of Lord Shiva (Sundaramahalinga Swamy Temple) on Sathuragiri hills in the southern region. Similar to his recent Kancheepuram rally, he said Ramanathapuram was linked to Kashi by the bonds of faith and spirituality. In Kerala, Congress, Communists and Muslim League are playing a ""dangerous"" game regarding Sabarimala temple, the PM said, adding ""They are using brute force to strike at the root of faith and aspiration. Sadly for them till BJP is there, no one will be able to destroy our faith and culture,"" he said in Ramanathapuram. ""...we must continue working for the prosperity of our Sri Lankan Tamil brothers and we must end the dynasty rule of corrupt families,"" he said in his Theni address. Chief Minister E Palaniswami, who also addressed the gathering, hit out at arch rival DMK over its alliance with the Congress. He asked the party to clarify whom it would support in neighbouring Kerala, whether the Congress or the CPI(M) as they both were its allies in Tamil Nadu. The DMK and Congress though ""sworn enemies"" have joined hands, despite the national party having ""humiliated"" its southern ally in the past, PM Modi said. Even during the 2G spectrum allocation scam, the DMK leaders criticised Congress, he pointed out. ""In an attempt to mislead the people, all the corrupt have ganged up in an attempt to defeat Modi,"" he added. He said the DMK has to ""resort to gimmicks"" just to draw people to its rallies. Picking holes in opposition unity, he said DMK president MK Stalin's ""Rahul Gandhi for Prime Minister"" pitch did not find takers in the grand alliance since there were other leaders with the same aspiration. The Congress, the DMK and their other '' mahamilawati '' friends can never work for India''s development, he claimed. ""This land of Theni is known for brave people who served the nation, it is now up to you to decide how you will you deal with those who questioned the surgical and air strikes done by our brave armed forces,"" he said. The Indian Air Force (IAF) had carried out airstrikes on terror camps in Pakistan in February last. ""When it comes to national security there can be no compromise. I assure my fellow Indians that we leave no stone unturned in protecting India and destroying forces of terror."" ""Our guiding principle is nation first. Opposition believes in family first. If you go to Delhi, prime real estate has been used for memorials on members of only one family, it is as if no other person contributed to India except one family."" The BJP, however, believed in the contribution of every citizen in making India stronger and that was why a grand memorial was built for APJ Kalam in Rameswaram, he said wrapping up his election campaign in Tamil Nadu. There were no memorials for past presidents like Dr S Radhakrishnan though in every town, Congress had named so many roads and buildings after ""one family."" In both rallies, PM Modi referred to ongoing development projects in Tamil Nadu and listed his governments welfare initiatives like the free LPG connections.

2002 Riots Victim Bilkis Bano To Get Rs 50 Lakh Compensation: Top Court,2002 Riots Victim Bilkis Bano To Get Rs 50 Lakh Compensation: Top Court,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bilkis-bano-2002-gujarat-riots-victim-to-get-rs-50-lakh-compensation-and-government-job-orders-supre-2027251,en,"Bilkis Bano -- whose gangrape and family's massacre became one of the worst instances of the brutality of the 2002 riots in Gujarat -- will receive a compensation of Rs 50 lakh from the state government, the Supreme Court ordered today. On learning that she has no place to live and been leading a nomadic life since 2002, a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi also asked the state to provide her with a government job and accommodation. The Gujarat government told the Court that it has taken action against police officers involved in the case, blocking the pension of four and demoting a fifth. Turning down the state government's offer of Rs 5 lakh, Bilkis Bano had sought exemplary compensation and action against the police officers who tried to derail the investigation and were convicted by the Bombay High Court. Bilkis Bano's family was attacked by a mob at Randhikpur, a village near Ahmedabad, during the post-Godhra riots on 3 March 2002. Fourteen members of her family were murdered. The youngest of them was Bilkis Bano's three-year-old daughter Saleha, whose head was smashed with a rock. Bilkis Bano, who was pregnant at the time, was gang raped. She survived only because the men left her for dead. In 2008, 11 men were convicted for the rape and given life imprisonment by the Bombay High Court. But no action was taken against the police officers who had tried to derail the investigation into the case by fudging evidence and influencing witnesses even though they had been convicted by the court.  Bilkis Bano's lawyer had told the Supreme Court that four of the officers had retired and a fifth - IPS officer RS Bhagora - was about to. But no disciplinary action had been taken against them. The top court had ordered action and directed the state government to file a report. Today, the Gujarat government informed the top court that the pension of the four retired officers has been blocked. The senior officer, Deputy Commissioner RS Bhagora, who is still serving, is being demoted. In its judgment, the high court had ordered the five policemen to pay a fine Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 5,000. But they were not given any prison term since they had already spent time in jail as undertrials.

Hardik Patel Requests Supreme Court To Cancel Conviction To Contest Polls,Hardik Patel Requests Supreme Court To Cancel Conviction To Contest Polls,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congresss-hardik-patel-requests-supreme-court-to-cancel-his-conviction-in-rioting-case-so-he-can-con-2015951,en,"Patidar leader Hardik Patel moved the Supreme Court today, challenging the Gujarat High Court order, which declined to stay his conviction so that he can contest the Lok Sabha elections, scheduled to start in ten days. The lower court at Mehsana in Gujarat had sentenced him to two years' imprisonment last July, for rioting and arson in 2015, during the Patidar quota protests. The High Court in August 2018 had suspended Hardik Patel's sentence but not the conviction. On Friday, the court declined to cancel his conviction. Under the Representation of the People Act, a convict facing a jail term of two years or more cannot contest unless the conviction is stayed. ""My only fault is that I did not bow down before the BJP . This is the result of fighting the government,"" said the 25-year-old Patidar leader, who had led the quota stir. He said that he will campaign for the Congress - the party he joined earlier this month - across the country. ""We will not get scared. We will keep raising the concerns of the common man with truth, non-violence and honesty. We will ensure that the Congress forms a government. For the party, I will campaign in Gujarat and across the country,"" he said after the court setback last week. The Gujarat government on March 20 opposed stay on Hardik Patel's conviction and sought time to produce more documents related to his petition, seeking cancellation of his conviction. The court granted the government's counsel time till March 26 to submit the documents. After submitting the documents, the state government told the court that Hardik Pate l was a habitual offender and there are several cases against him in various police stations. The public prosecutor had requested for more time from the court to submit additional documents. The Congress leader's lawyer had opposed this and argued before the court that the Gujarat government was wasting time. It is a race against time for Hardik Patel as the last date for filing nominations is April 4.

Ex-Jharkhand Minister Asked By Top Court To Surrender In Riot Cases,Ex-Jharkhand Minister Asked By Top Court To Surrender In Riot Cases,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ex-jharkhand-minister-yogendra-sao-asked-by-top-court-to-surrender-in-riot-cases-2022057,en,"The Supreme Court on Friday directed former Jharkhand minister Yogendra Sao to surrender before a court in Ranchi by April 15 in cases related to rioting and inciting of violence. A bench headed by Justice SA Bobde said that Yogendra Sao will have to surrender by Monday. Advocate Tapesh Kumar Singh, appearing for Jharkhand, said that Yogendra Sao can surrender before the concerned trial court in Ranchi. He said all the case records have been transferred to Ranchi in compliance with the top court order. The top court order came on a plea of Yogendra Sao seeking clarification of the order on the place of his surrender. The top court had on April 4, trashed Yogendra Sao's plea seeking to campaign for the Congress in the current Lok Sabha polls and cancelled his bail, saying he has violated the bail conditions. It had transferred the trial of 18 cases against Yogendra Sao and his wife Nirmala Devi to Ranchi from Hazaribagh district in Jharkhand. Yogendra Sao became a minister in the Hemant Soren-led UPA government in Jharkhand in 2013. He is an accused in over a dozen cases of rioting and instigation of violence. Both Yogendra Sao and Devi were granted bail on December 15, 2017, by the top court and directed to stay in Bhopal as a bail condition. They were allowed to visit Jharkhand only for court hearings under police protection after intimating the Bhopal superintendent of police. It was found that Yogendra Sao left Bhopal on several occasions without any intimation to local authorities despite the court directions and his presence in Jharkhand during the corresponding period was not disputed, the court had earlier said.

He has also filed an application seeking bail. His application came up for hearing before a bench of Justices SA Bobde and SA Nazeer today. Appearing for the CBI, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta opposed his plea. ""The massacre of Sikhs is a gruesome offence. He was the leader of the massacre,"" he told the bench. The case in which Sajjan Kumar was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment's Raj Nagar Part-I area on November 1 and 2, 1984. During the arguments, the counsel representing Sajjan Kumar told the bench that a key witness in the case had earlier given four statements in which she had not named him but later, she mentioned him in her statement. Mr Mehta also told the bench about the circumstances in which Sajjan Kumar was granted anticipatory bail and argued that a violent mob had gathered at his residence when CBI team had gone there during probe into the case. The bench was also told by one of the advocates that Sajjan Kumar was a sitting lawmaker in 1984 and several Sikhs were killed during the riots in his constituency. ""Today, you (Kumar) are convicted by the high court. It is not a charge by police. We cannot treat it lightly."" The bench, however, asked the CBI to apprise it of the status of the ongoing trial in the case involving Sajjan Kumar and listed his bail plea for hearing on April 15.

High Court Orders Day-To-Day Hearing In Death Sentence Case Of 1984 Riots,High Court Orders Day-To-Day Hearing In Death Sentence Case Of 1984 Riots,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/high-court-orders-day-to-day-hearing-in-death-sentence-case-of-1984-riots-2016136,en,"The Delhi High Court has ordered day-to-day hearing in the death reference as also the convict's appeal against the capital punishment awarded to him in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Manoj Kumar Ohri said the appeal and the death reference of convict Yashpal Singh would be heard on daily basis till the conclusion of arguments. ""List for hearing on April 22. It is made clear that, the hearing of the connected appeal and death reference shall be conducted on day to day basis till the conclusion of the arguments,"" the bench said in a recent order. The court had earlier sought response of the police on Yashpal Singh's plea challenging his death sentence in the case. He has filed the appeal against his conviction and sentence by a trial court. He has also filed a bail plea in the matter. The bench had also issued notice to Yashpal Singh on the reference to confirm his death sentence. The trial court had also awarded life term to co-convict Naresh Sherawat in the case relating to the killing of two men in New Delhi during the 1984 riots -- the first convictions in the cases reopened by the Special Investigation Team (SIT). Naresh Sherawat has also appealed against his conviction and sentence before the high court which has sought response of the police in the plea. The Delhi Police had closed the case in 1994 for want of evidence, but it was reopened by the SIT. The SIT is investigating nearly 60 cases related to the riots, while it has filed ""untraced report"" in 52 cases. While this was the first death penalty after the SIT was formed, one Kishori was earlier given the death penalty by a trial court in as many as seven anti-Sikh riots cases. However, the Delhi High Court confirmed death penalty only in three cases, which were later commuted to life term by the apex court. As per the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the death penalty cannot be executed unless confirmed by the high court. The trial court had awarded varying jail terms to the convicts and imposed fines for offences including attempt to murder, dacoity and attacking victims by dangerous weapons. It had spared convict Naresh Sherawat the gallows on medical grounds. Earlier, the trial court had convicted Yashpal and Naresh for killing Hardev Singh and Avtar Singh in Mahipalpur area of South Delhi on November 1, 1984 during the riots that had taken place after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at her residence by two Sikh bodyguards a day before. The case was lodged on a complaint by victim Hardev's brother Santokh Singh. The trial court had held both the accused guilty for the offences of murder, attempt to murder, dacoity and voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means under the IPC. A mob of about 500 persons, led by the two convicts, had encircled the house of the victims and had killed them. It was just one of the incidents out of several others Delhi alone witnessed during the riots that saw around 3,000 people being killed. Of the 650 cases registered in connection with the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, 267 were closed as untraced by the Delhi Police. Of these 267 cases, five were later taken up by the CBI. The SIT also scrutinised records of 18 cancelled cases. Get the latest election news , live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

A bench comprising Justices SA Bobde and S Abdul Nazeer extended the time after the SIT informed it that more than 50 per cent of the work has been done and it wanted two more months to complete the investigation. The top court also issued notice to parties on a plea by petitioner S Gurlad Singh Kahlon, a member of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, seeking inquiry into role of 62 policemen named in the riots. The top court had on January 11 last year constituted the SIT headed by former Delhi High Court judge Justice SN Dhingra and comprising retired IPS officer Rajdeep Singh and serving IPS officer Abhishek Dular to supervise further probe into the 186 riots cases, in which closure reports had been filed earlier. However, the SIT presently has only two members as Mr Singh had declined to be a part of the team on ""personal grounds"". The top court had appointed the three-member SIT after the Ministry of Home Affairs and counsel for petitioner SGS Kahlon arrived at a consensus with regard to the persons who could be appointed in the fresh SIT. Large-scale riots had broken out in the national capital following the assassination of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh security guards on October 31, 1984. The violence had claimed 2,733 lives in Delhi alone. The court had said the previous SIT did not carry out further probe into the 186 cases and had directed setting up of a fresh SIT comprising a former high court judge and two police officers. Justice Dhingra, who had retired from the Delhi High Court, had dealt with several high-profile cases including the 2001 Parliament Attack case as a trial judge. As the judge of the trial court, he had dealt with many of the 1984 riot cases, and his verdicts had resulted in conviction in 16 cases. On August 16, 2017, the apex court had appointed a supervisory panel to examine the earlier SIT''s decision to close 241 cases. The Centre had said that out of 250 riots cases which were probed by that SIT, closure reports were filed in 241. It had said some cases were still being investigated by the SIT, and two by the CBI. The earlier SIT was headed by Pramod Asthana, an IPS officer of 1986 batch, and comprised retired district and sessions judge Rakesh Kapoor and additional deputy commissioner of the Delhi Police Kumar Gyanesh. Mr Kahlon had told the court that a total of 293 riot-related cases were taken up for scrutiny by the earlier SIT which later decided to close 199 of them. He had sought the top court's direction for setting up another SIT to ensure speedy justice to the riot victims.

Protesters will also be stopped from entering streets surrounding the Arc de Triomphe, at the top of the avenue, as well as several nearby areas, including the presidential Elysee Palace and the National Assembly, the Paris prefect's office said. ""There are serious reasons to believe that violence and damages are likely during the scheduled demonstrations,"" the office said. Similar bans were planned in other major cities, including Toulouse, in southwestern France, where officials said the main city square will be out of bounds for demonstrators. Protests will also be outlawed in much of the southern city of Nice, where Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Sunday. The Paris prefect's office said anyone defying the bans would face fines, part of tough new measures vowed by the government to prevent another flare-up of violence. In other areas of Paris, ""the right to demonstrate, which is a fundamental freedom, will be allowed"", but ""any riotous groups will be immediately dispersed,"" police warned. Last Saturday, police appeared to hang back as hundreds of violent protesters rampaged along the Champs-Elysees , burning and looting more than 100 businesses in unrest that cost the Paris police chief his job. Addressing the new Paris police chief Didier Lallement on Thursday, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner demanded a ""zero tolerance"" approach towards violent demonstrators. ""Black blocs belong in prison, not on the Champs-Elysees,"" he said, referring to the black-clad anarchists that overran the Champs-Elysees on Saturday. The weekly Saturday protests began on November 17 over fuel tax increases and quickly ballooned into an anti-government rebellion against Macron's policies , seen by the protesters as geared towards the rich. Although several of the initial protests ended in rioting, the clashes with police had eased as participation dwindled in recent weeks. Destruction of property is estimated to have cost 200 million euros ($227 million) so far over the 18 weeks of protests, according to Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire.

With April 4 being the last date of filing of nominations in Gujarat, Hardik Patel has a few days to challenge the judgement in the Supreme Cour t.

He was granted bail and his sentence was suspended in August 2018 by the high court, but his conviction was not stayed. The Patidar leader had moved the High Court on March 8 for a stay on his conviction, which was yesterday opposed by the BJP-led Gujarat government. Hardik Patel had joined the Congress two weeks ago in the presence of party president Rahul Gandhi in Ahmedabad. He had also made his intention to contest Lok Sabha elections from Gujarat's Jamnagar constituency clear earlier this month. The Jamnagar Lok Sabha seat is currently represented by Poonamben Maadam of the BJP. Hardik Patel had risen to prominence when he led an agitation by the Patidar community in 2015, demanding that the community should get benefits of the quota for backward castes. He had backed the Congress in the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections in which the party gave a stiff competition to the BJP, winning 81 out of 182 assembly seats.

Speaking at an event in Lucknow, Mr Singh said: ""When I took the office of Home Ministry in 2014, I got to know that the ministry had the extra fund of Rs 90 crore that was meant for the victims of anti-Sikh riots victims, but the Congress had not released it."" ""I ordered the release of the fund. And we have given Rs 2 lakh to every family of the victim,"" he added. ""It is the first time, that a leader of the then ruling party has been convicted for his crime during the riots. It could be possible because the BJP was at the Centre. And I had also ordered the formation of SIT to investigate the riots ."" He further criticised the Congress for questioning Balakot strike conducted by Indian Air Force . ""I can assure you every action was taken after the intelligence input. I don't understand the attack was conducted in Pakistan, why Congress is feeling pain?"" Mr Singh also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that he has emerged as the ""most popular leader"" of the world. Mr Singh further added that, ""I am not telling you because the election is coming, but India's Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) is not only India's favourite leader but has also emerged as the world's most popular leader.""

Indian Man Gets 5-Year Jail For Swinging Plank During Riot In Singapore,Indian Man Gets 5-Year Jail For Swinging Plank During Riot In Singapore,https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indian-man-yadwinder-singh-gets-5-years-in-jail-for-swinging-a-plank-during-riot-in-singapore-2011346,en,"An Indian man on Friday was sentenced to five years jail and 12 strokes of the cane for swinging a plank during a riot involving about 60 people outside a Gurudwara in Singapore. Yadwinder Singh, 26, was the leader of one of the two groups of people who started fighting outside Silat Road Sikh Temple in Bukit Merah area in April, 2017, Channel News Asia reported. The two groups of men wielded wooden poles, planks and belts, spilling onto the road and disrupting traffic, the court heard. The court did not specify the reasons behind the fight. Footage from a public bus, played in court on Friday, showed Yadwinder swinging a long wooden plank at members of the opposing group, the court heard. The court heard that Yadwinder and his group gathered at the bus stop outside the Gurudwara after prayers that morning. Some of them had armed themselves with wooden planks. They chased after the men from the opposing group, who were walking along Kampong Bahru Road after leaving the Gurudwara, shouting vulgarities at them before attacking them, the daily said. Men from both sides attacked each other with poles, planks and belts in the melee. Yadwinder was seen hitting two men with his wooden plank, injuring one man's scalp and face. After his arrest, Yadwinder plotted to leave Singapore illegally. He had already been jailed previously for rioting and unlawful assembly in 2016 and had committed this fresh offence while on remission. He was also on bail for another extortion offence. Two weeks before his trial for rioting began, Yadwinder made plans to leave the country illegally, paying a man SGD 4,000 to flee Singapore in the cargo hold of a bus. He carried out his plan in October 2018, after the first tranche of the trial, but was discovered by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at Tuas Checkpoint linking to southern Peninsular Malaysia. He was arrested, along with the bus driver on being found hiding in the cargo hold of the vehicle. After seeing how Yadwinder had been arrested for trying to leave Singapore, three men accused of being involved in the riot stopped turning up for the trial, the court heard. Arrest warrants were put out for them and they have been at large since. Yadwinder pleaded guilty after a five-day trial to rioting with a deadly weapon, failing to present travel documents upon departure and extortion with common intention. Two months before the riot, he and four others extorted SGD 200 from a 21-year-old Indian national, according to the Channel News Asia report. They threatened to report her to the public housing authority, Housing and Development Boar, for supposedly having more than the legal number of tenants in her flat. Yadwinder, who was unrepresented, was sentenced to jail for five years and five months, along with 12 strokes of the cane. District Judge Marvin Bay gave him an additional jail term of 129 days for committing a crime while on remission for earlier offences, the maximum possible for this case. According to a list prepared by Deputy Public Prosecutor Jason Chua, Yadwinder had been committing crimes repeatedly since 2015, three years after arriving in Singapore to work in construction. The judge granted Yadwinder 10 minutes to speak to his fiancee and friends who attended the hearing, as long as they ""maintained a certain civility"". All of Yadwinder's co-accused have been dealt with in court. One of his opponents, Nirmal Singh, who had swung his belt during the riot, had his appeal against his 31-month jail sentence and caning dismissed by the High Court.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna Recuses From Hearing Sajjan Kumar's Appeal,Justice Sanjiv Khanna Recuses From Hearing Sajjan Kumar's Appeal,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-sanjiv-khanna-recuses-from-hearing-sajjan-kumars-appeal-2012597,en,"Supreme Court judge Justice Sanjiv Khanna Monday once again recused himself from hearing the appeal of former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar who has challenged the Delhi High Court verdict sentencing him to life term in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. On February 25, Justice Khanna had recused himself from hearing Mr Kumar's appeal when he was sitting in a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi. The matter came up for hearing on Monday before a bench of Justices S A Bobde and Sanjiv Khanna. The bench said the case would now come up for hearing after two weeks. The case in which Mr Kumar was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment's Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1 and 2, 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II. Anti-Sikh riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards. 73-year-old Kumar had surrendered before a trial court on December 31, 2018, to serve the sentence in pursuance of the high court's December 17 judgment awarding him life imprisonment for the ""remainder of his natural life"". After his conviction in the case, Mr Kumar had resigned from the Congress party. The CBI has recently told the apex court that Mr Kumar's plea seeking bail in the matter should be dismissed as he has a ""large political clout"" and is capable of ""influencing or terrorising"" witnesses in the case pending against him. It has told the court that fair trial in the pending case would not be possible if Mr Kumar is granted bail. The top court had earlier admitted Mr Kumar's appeal for hearing and had also issued notice to the CBI on his bail plea seeking its response. The high court had convicted and sentenced Mr Kumar to spend the remainder of his life in jail for the offences of criminal conspiracy and abetment in commission of crimes of murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony and defiling and destruction of a Gurdwara. It had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by a trial court to five others - former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and ex-MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. In its judgment, the high court had noted that over 2,700 Sikhs were killed in the national capital during the 1984 riots which was indeed a ""carnage of unbelievable proportions"". It had said the riots were a ""crime against humanity"" perpetrated by those who enjoyed ""political patronage"" and aided by an ""indifferent"" law enforcement agency. The high court had set aside the trial court''s 2010 verdict which had acquitted Mr Kumar in the case.

Paris Police Chief Sacked After Champs-Elysees Rioting,Paris Police Chief Sacked After Champs-Elysees Rioting,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-police-michel-delpuech-chief-sacked-after-champs-elysees-rioting-2009577,en,"The French government sacked the top police official in Paris on Monday following another weekend of rioting in the capital during ""yellow vest"" protests which have put President Emmanuel Macron on the defensive. The police's failure to keep the Paris protests from spiralling out of control over the weekend again cast a harsh spotlight on their tactics. About 5,000 police were deployed in the capital on Saturday, far outnumbering the several hundred black-clad rioters who caused havoc in front of groups of often passive policemen for more than seven hours on the famed Champs-Elysees. Business owners were left fuming Monday, as Macron cut short his skiing holiday to meet top ministers to discuss the 18th consecutive Saturday of ""yellow vest"" demonstrations . ""The events of last Saturday, in particular on the Champs-Elysees, were unacceptable and the president asked the government to provide a response that was up to the needs of the situation,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a televised statement. After criticising ""inappropriate"" instructions on the use of rubber bullets given to security forces, he announced that the head of Paris police, 66-year-old Michel Delpuech, had been fired and would be replaced on Wednesday. He said French authorities would ban rallies on the Champs-Elysees and elsewhere if hooligans were detected there, adding that fines would be increased from 38 to 135 euros for people attending unauthorised protests. While the public's safety remains a priority, ""the outburst of violence justifies a firm (police) response,"" Philippe told France 2 television on Monday evening. Numbers down More than 100 businesses were damaged at the weekend in Paris including dozens of luxury shops and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees. Since the end of December, the number of ""yellow vest"" protesters has fallen, but each Saturday thousands still take to the streets, including far-right and far-left groups as well as anarchists who are responsible for much of the violence. A hard core of protesters have already vowed to cause havoc again next Saturday. ""Every Sunday large cities across France wake up to the same old story: smouldering barricades and a strident declaration from Christophe Castaner,"" leftwing daily Liberation wrote Monday. Some have called for French police to be far more active in tackling troublemakers. ""You have to take responsibility and engage, with the possibility that people will get hurt,"" said Frederic Lagache of the Alliance police union on Monday. For decades, French authorities have usually preferred the opposite, controlling mass protests with tear gas and rubber bullets while avoiding physical confrontation between police and large groups, experts say. Although some protesters have been injured by the rubber bullets, so far nobody has been killed in clashes with police, but officials say the risk would increase if officers charged the hostile crowds. ""They would rather see a building damaged, with insurance companies footing the bill, than risk direct contact between police and demonstrators that might cause serious injuries or death,"" said Olivier Cahn at France's Cesdip law enforcement research institute. 'Less reactive' But critics say the government needs to drastically rethink its approach for stamping out the rioting. ""There are techniques and strategies for separating violent demonstrators from the others,"" Cahn said. ""Germany has strategies for de-escalating the tensions and separating protesters that are quite effective."" Junior Interior Minister Laurent Nunez admitted on RTL radio on Monday that police ""were less aggressive, less reactive than usual"" over the weekend, promising a review of the instructions given to officers and their deployment. Castaner, a long-time ally of Macron who had no law-and-order experience before becoming interior minister in October, is also facing renewed scrutiny of his record amid calls for his resignation from some in the opposition Republicans party. While seen as too lax on Saturday, French authorities have been accused on other weekends of being too heavy-handed, highlighting the government's difficulty of managing the crisis. The UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet called for a ""full investigation"" into the possible use of excessive force by French police during the protests in an address on March 6. Since the demonstrations began on November 17, some 1,900 people have been hurt, including dozens who have suffered serious injuries from stun grenades or rubber bullets fired by police. Rights groups have tried to have the heavy rubber bullets used by the French police banned, noting that France is one of only a handful of Western countries to use them.

"Paris Luxury Stores Looted, Burned In ""Yellow Vest"" Riots","Paris Luxury Stores Looted, Burned In ""Yellow Vest"" Riots",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/paris-luxury-stores-looted-burned-in-yellow-vest-riots-2008739,en,"Rioters looted and torched shops and businesses on the famed Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris on Saturday, on the 18th weekend of French ""yellow vest"" protests, characterised by a sharp increase in violence after weeks of dwindling turnout. President Emmanuel Macron cut short a skiing trip in the Pyrenees to return to Paris for a crisis meeting, as hooded protesters went on the rampage in Paris, leaving a trail of destruction in the touristic heart of the city. The police appeared overrun as protesters swarmed the Champs-Elysees, vandalising and later setting fire to Fouquet's brasserie, a favourite hangout of the rich and famous for the past century -- as well as luxury handbag store Longchamp, a bank, another restaurant and several news stands. The rioters also looted several clothing stores and set fire to barricades in scenes reminiscent of the worst yellow-vest riots in Paris in December. French anti-riot policemen stand outside the restaurant ""Le Fouquet's"" which was partially burnt down on the Champs-Elysees in Paris ""Like the vast majority of French people, I feel very angry today,"" tweeted French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who visited the scene. ""Today's actions are not the work of protesters, but of looters, arsonists and criminals. No cause justifies this violence,"" he added. In a statement, the national police denounced the ""mindless violence, cowardly attacks"" and stressed their determination to guarantee public order against ""provocateurs and vandals"". Bank blaze Saturday's turnout was seen a test of the ongoing strength of the movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes and quickly ballooned into a rebellion against Macron's policies, seen by the protesters as geared towards the rich. In recent weeks, the protests have dwindled in size. But the interior ministry estimated the turnout in Paris Saturday at 10,000, out of around 32,300 nationwide. That is a fraction of the 282,000 people they said took part in the inaugural demonstrations across France on November 17, but more than the previous weekend. Saturday's protests were markedly more violent than in recent weeks. Police said close to 240 people were arrested, while prosecutors said more than 100 had been taken into custody. Jewellery that was partially destroyed and looted during clashes between Yellow Vest protesters and riot police forces on the Champs-Elysees in Paris The bank set alight was on the ground floor of an apartment building, and fire firefighters had to quickly evacuate the residents, including a nine-month-old baby. Eleven people suffered minor injuries in the bank blaze, the fire service told AFP. The violence left 17 members of the police injured, and 42 protesters, said police. 'Ultra-violent' minority Macron was due to hold an emergency meeting at the interior ministry on Saturday evening, his office said. The rally coincides with the end of the public debates called by the president to try take the heat out of the protests and give voters a forum to propose policy changes. Around half a million people turned out at townhall-style meetings held around the country over the past two months. But many ""yellow vests"" dismissed the consultation exercise as a smoke-screen. Outside the restaurant ""Le Fouquet's"" set on fire during clashes with riot police forces on the Champs-Elysees in Paris On Saturday, the police used tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon to try repel protesters who gathered at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe war memorial, which was sacked by protesters on December 1. But for seven hours they continued to be pelted with paving stones by mostly black-clad demonstrators. ""There are a number of people who have come just to smash things,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said, estimating that some 1,500 ""ultra-violent"" activists had infiltrated the crowd. ""We have been too nice, that's why it's violent today. I'm not in favour (of violence) but we are ruled by corrupt people who dare to lecture us,"" Jean-Francois Bernard, a landscape gardener who was among the protesters, told AFP. The presidency later announced that Macron was returning home from La Mongie ski resort where he and his wife Brigitte arrived Thursday to spend the weekend. A statement from his office said he would attend a crisis meeting on the violence at the interior ministry later Saturday. 'We want results' Protesters streamed into the capital by train and car for a rally they called an ""ultimatum"" to the president. Over 5,000 police were deployed, along with several armoured police vehicles. Macron was caught off guard when grassroots protesters began occupying traffic roundabouts in November over fuel taxes. He has loosened the state's purse strings to the tune of 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) to try defuse the protests. Destroyed Hugo Boss shop window on the Champs-Elysees in Paris But the measures failed to quell the anger of the demonstrators, who accuse the former investment banker of being elitist and favouring the rich. The Paris protest was one of several in the capital on Saturday, where tens of thousands of climate campaigners also held a demonstration to demand that the French government uphold its commitments on reducing emissions. Yellow vest protests also took place several other French cities. At Bordeaux, in the southwest, police clashed with protesters and a bank was damaged.

A Boss menswear store and the upscale Fouquet's restaurant -- a brasserie popular with politicians and film stars - were among the premises to have their windows smashed by groups of hooded demonstrators in scenes reminiscent of the worst ""yellow vest"" riots in Paris in December. The demonstrators also set fire to a bank situated on the ground floor of an apartment building, which was engulfed by flames. The fire service evacuated the residents and extinguished the blaze. Eleven people, including two fire fighters, suffered minor injuries, according to BFM news channel. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner in a tweet accused the arsonists of being ""neither demonstrators, nor trouble-makers"" but ""murderers."" The protests came a day after President Emmanuel Macron arrived in the southwestern Pyrenees mountains with his wife Brigitte for a short ski break, an AFP photographer reported. ""I'm going to spend two to three days here to rest and rediscover landscapes and faces that are dear to me,"" Macron told La Depeche du Midi newspaper. 'Ultra-violent' minority Saturday's turnout is a test for the ""yellow vest"" movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes and quickly ballooned into a anti-government rebellion but has struggled lately to mobilise large numbers of protesters. Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17. The rally coincides with the end of the public debates called by President Emmanuel Macron to try take the heat out of the protests and give voters a forum to propose policy changes. Around half a million people turned out at townhall-style meetings held around the country over the past two months, But many ""yellow vests"" dismissed the consultation as a smoke-screen. The police on Saturday used tear gas and water cannon to repel protesters who gathered at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe war memorial, which was sacked by protesters on December 1 in scenes that drew international condemnation. A newsstand also went up in smoke as groups of mostly black-clad demonstrators pelted the security forces with stones and erected barricades. ""There are a number of people who have come just to smash things,"" Castaner said, estimating that some 1,500 ""ultra violent"" activists had infiltrated the crowd of ""between 7,000 and 8,000"". On social media, ""yellow vest"" leaders had hinted at the arrival of sympathisers from Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and even Poland. ""Macron, we're coming to get you at home,"" some of the protesters chanted, referring to the presidential palace situated near the Champs-Elysees. Forty-four people had been arrested by the early afternoon, the police said. 'We want results' From early morning protesters began pouring into the capital by train and car from around the country for what they called an ""ultimatum"" to Macron. Over 5,000 police were deployed, along with several armoured police vehicles, and several metro stations were closed. Macron, who was caught off guard when grassroots protesters began occupying traffic roundabouts in November over fuel taxes, has loosened the state's purse strings to the tune of 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) to try defuse the protests. He also travelled the length and breadth of the country, engaging in marathon debates with local politicians and voters. But the measures failed to quell the anger of the demonstrators, who accuse the former investment banker, of being in the pocket of the rich. Laurent Casanova, an engineer who was among the protesters on Saturday, told AFP he wanted to mark the end of the debates. ""We have been patient but now we want results,"" he said. The protest was one of several planned in Paris on Saturday, where climate campaigners also gathered in their thousands to demand Macron go further on greening the economy.

Presenting a report card on the completion of two years of his government, he said when he assumed office in March 2017, debt-ridden farmers were committing suicides and Uttar Pradesh had become ""synonymous with murder, loot and riots."" ""Mafia was looting the state's resources under political patronage. Mafia was rampant in SP, BSP rule,"" he alleged. ""There was a long era of scams."" Mr Adityanath said he has changed the ""perception about the state"" and improved its ""tarnished image"". The better atmosphere has become a ""nazeer"" (model) for the country, he said. Hitting out at previous state governments, he said, ""In 2012, there were 227 major communal riots. In 2013, there were 247 such riots. In 2014, there were 242 riots. And 219 riots in 2015 and more than 100 in 2016 - in which properties worth crores were lost."" ""However during thee BJP government, not a single riot took place. Nor were there any incident of acid attacks or kidnapping,"" he claimed. Though there has been no major communal violence in Uttar Pradesh during the past two years, a mob of 400 people, including right-wing activists, had fought pitched battles with police in Bulandshahr district in December last year. The violence in Siana area of Bulandshahr happened apparently after right-wing activists were angered by the discovery of cow carcasses strewn in a nearby jungle. In January last year, a 22-year-old youth was shot dead during a""Tiranga Yatra"" by some people after which a series of violent incidents and arsoning had taken place in Kasganj. Taking lesson from it, the state government that year denied permission for any such procession on Independence Day in the western Uttar Pradesh city. On Tuesday, at his press conference in Lucknow, Mr Adityanath cited the reported exodus of Hindus in 2017 from Kairana, another city in western UP, ""due to anarchic forces"". ""However"", he said, ""today peace has returned as well as the traders who had fled from there."" The exodus of Hindus from Kairana was a major poll issue for BJP in the 2017 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. The chief minister said the confidence of the state police force has gone up and there is no interference from his government in their functioning. ""There is zero tolerance for crime and criminals and 73 criminals have been killed in police encounters. Unfortunately, half-a-dozen police jawans also attained martyrdom in the encounters,"" he said. Mr Adityanath also said that the UP Foundation Day was celebrated for first time after 68 years in 2018. His deputies Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma and Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey were also present at the press conference.

Justice AG Uraizee granted the government's counsel time till March 26 to submit the documents. After submitting documents before the court on Tuesday, saying that Mr Patel is a habitual offender with several FIRs registered against him in various police stations, the public prosecutor had requested more time from the court to submit more documents. Mr Patel's lawyer, however, opposed this and argued before the court that the government was wasting time. Mr Patel had, on March 8, moved the Gujarat High Court to stay his conviction in a 2015 rioting case. He was convicted in July last year by the Visnagar sessions court in Mehsana district in a case of rioting connected to the Patidar quota stir that took place in 2015. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, which bars him from contesting elections as per a Supreme Court order on the issue. Although the high court granted bail to the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader, and suspended his two year sentence in August last year, his conviction was not stayed by the court.

In 2013, there were 247 such riots. In 2014, there were 242 riots. And 219 riots in 2015 and more than 100 in 2016 - in which properties worth crores were lost."" ""However during thee BJP government, not a single riot took place. Nor were there any incident of acid attacks or kidnapping,"" he claimed. Mayawati's ally, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, had sai d that the the two years of the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh have been like a ""curse"" for the people. Though there has been no major communal violence in Uttar Pradesh during the past two years, the mob violence in western Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr had grabbed national headlines last year. A mob of 400 people, including right-wing activists, had clashed with police in Bulandshahr district in December last year. A police officer and a young man were killed in the frenzy. In January last year, a 22-year-old man was shot dead during a""Tiranga Yatra"" by some people after which a series of violent incidents had taken place in Kasganj district. The state government then denied permission for any such procession on Independence Day in the western Uttar Pradesh city. The Chief Minister had said when he assumed office in March 2017, debt-ridden farmers were committing suicides and that Uttar Pradesh had become ""synonymous with murder, loot and riots.""

Justice Khanna indicated that he had heard Sajjan Kumar's petition, when he was a judge of the Delhi High Court. Sajjan Kumar has challenged the High Court verdict, sentencing him to life imprisonment in the riots case. The Delhi High Court had reversed the trial court order, which had acquitted the former Congress legislator on April 30, 2013. The High Court found him guilty of the murders, following the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. A bench of Justice S Muralidhar and Justice Vinod Goel had made clear that Sajjan Kumar's term in jail will be for the remainder of his life.

The Muzaffarnagar riots, one of the worst communal clashes in Uttar Pradesh's history, had led to the killings of 66 people and over 50,000 were displaced. The seven men - Muzammil, Mujassim, Furkan, Nadeem, Janangir, Afzal and Ikbal - were convicted for killing two men in Kawal village and rioting - by a local court in Muzaffarnagar on Wednesday. According to the police complaint, two men of Kawal village were battered to death by five of the seven convicts over a minor altercation. The two other accused, Afzal and Iqbal, were summoned by the court later under provisions of section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code when the evidence of their complicity in the killings emerged during the trial, reported news agency Press Trust of India. The clashes that broke out in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts after the two killings saw the deployment of the Army in the state for the first time in 20 years. More than 6,000 cases had been filed after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and nearly 1,500 people were arrested. The case, investigated by a Special Investigation Team or SIT, had filed 175 chargesheets. A probe into the riots had given a clean chit to the then Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh and blamed the local police and officials for misjudging and mishandling the situation. After the Yogi Adityanath government came to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, BJP leaders from western UP, some of whom are named in cases related to the Muzaffarnagar riots, approached the chief minister for withdrawal of cases against those who they say had been falsely implicated. The Yogi Adityanath government has moved to withdraw 38 cases so far, but those concerning BJP leaders continue to remain on track for now.

Queen Elizabeth To Be Evacuated In Case Of Riots Post Brexit: Report,Queen Elizabeth To Be Evacuated In Case Of Riots Post Brexit: Report,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-to-be-evacuated-in-case-of-riots-post-brexit-report-1987557,en,"British officials have revived Cold War emergency plans to relocate the royal family should there be riots in London if Britain suffers a disruptive departure from the European Union next month, two Sunday newspapers reported. ""These emergency evacuation plans have been in existence since the Cold War, but have now been repurposed in the event of civil disorder following a no-deal Brexit,"" the Sunday Times said, quoting an unnamed source from the government's Cabinet Office, which handles sensitive administrative issues. The Mail on Sunday also said it had learnt of plans to move the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth, to safe locations away from London. Britain's government is struggling to get parliamentary support for a Brexit transition agreement with the EU before the departure date of March 29, and the government and businesses are preparing contingency plans for a 'no-deal' Brexit. Business groups have warned of widespread disruption if there are lengthy delays to EU imports due to new customs checks, and even possible shortages of food and medicine. Last month an annual speech by the 92-year-old queen to a local women's group was widely interpreted in Britain as a call for politicians to reach agreement over Brexit. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker and keen supporter of Brexit, told the Mail on Sunday he believed the plans showed unnecessary panic by officials over a no-deal Brexit, as senior royals had remained in London during World War Two bombing. But the Sunday Times said an ex-police officer formerly in charge of royal protection, Dai Davies, expected Queen Elizabeth would be moved out of London if there was unrest. ""If there were problems in London, clearly you would remove the royal family away from those key sites,"" Davies was quoted as saying.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Samar Vishal convicted Jarwal and two others -- Salim and Dharam Prakash -- under various sections dealing with rioting, unlawful assembly, voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty, and assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging his duty. The court also convicted them under the provisions of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The order was delivered on Tuesday and released on Wednesday.

Quexit? Britain Has A Brexit Emergency Evacuation Plan For The Queen,Quexit? Britain Has A Brexit Emergency Evacuation Plan For The Queen,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/quexit-britain-has-a-brexit-emergency-evacuation-plan-for-the-queen-1988367,en,"Queen Elizabeth II and members of the British royal family are to be secreted away to an undisclosed location outside London if a no-deal Brexit scenario incites riots, British media reported Sunday. With Britain's scheduled exit from the European Union slated for March 29, Prime Minister Theresa May is running out of time, lawmakers can't stop squabbling, and Brits are stockpiling everything from bicycle parts to bottles of wine. Indeed, uncertainty is rife, but, thanks to plans dating to the Cold War, the queen, at least, will be saved. ""These emergency evacuation plans have been in existence since the Cold War but have now been repurposed in the event of civil disorder following a no-deal Brexit,"" a source from the British Cabinet Office told the Sunday Times, which chose not to reveal any additional details about the location. ""If there were problems in London, clearly you would remove the royal family away from those key sites,"" Dai Davies, the former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, told the Times. ""Where and how they will evacuate them is top secret and I can't discuss it."" The royals remained in Buckingham Palace during the Second World War, despite grave fears for their safety. For many Brits, the monarchy represents stability and hope throughout periods of upheaval. When the palace was bombed with the king and queen inside, the queen mother famously wrote in a letter soon after: ""The children will not leave unless I do. I shall not leave unless their father does, and the king will not leave the country in any circumstances."" For some commentators, the idea that the reigning monarch would up and leave in the eventuality of a no-deal Brexit was hard to imagine. ""The Royal Family remained in London throughout WW2, even when the Luftwaffe was raining bombs on the capital. But in opaquely sourced stories the Sunday Times and Mail on Sunday claim Brexit means the Queen might have to be 'evacuated'. Truly doth Brexit make some media mad,"" tweeted journalist Andrew Neil. Writing for the Telegraph, Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservative Party, called the royal evacuation plan ""Project Fear on steroids,"" and lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Mail on Sunday that the plans showed unnecessary panic. When asked about the royal evacuation plan, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams called the reports ""extraordinary."" ""It is beyond belief that it [the plan] has received so much exposure. Obviously there were plans to keep the royal family safe during the Cold War. It is common knowledge that the king and queen remained at Buckingham Palace during the Blitz. ""No doubt all sorts of plans are being dusted down if the possibility of civil unrest linked to Brexit is considered a possibility, but the idea that the monarch, the symbol of national unity, and other members of the royal family might have to be evacuated is simply bizarre. ""Who leaked it in Whitehall? I think it was the Ministry of Silly Walks!"" he joked. In a speech made last month, the 92-year-old queen urged people to ""speak well of each other"" despite challenging times and to respect ""different points of view."" The remarks came at a heightened period of tension in Britain and were interpreted as a nod to the political chaos unraveling in Westminster - despite the monarch's neutral stance on all things political.

CBI informed Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Amit Arora that lie detector test of controversial businessman Abhishek Verma, who volunteered to support the case by deposing as a witness, was conducted last December but that report could not be finalised due to non-availability of scientists. The court asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to expedite the process of finalising the report and granted it two weeks time and listed the matter for hearing on March 8. Filing a regular status report, in a sealed cover, on further investigation in the case the CBI also informed the court that they had received some queries from the Canadian government to which they have replied and are not waiting for the response. The court had earlier asked the CBI to write to the Canadian high commission in New Delhi for information regarding the case as one of the key witnesses has been residing in Canada. Senior advocate HS Phoolka, who has been representing the riots victim, has claimed that witnesses were influenced and there was evidence of one of the key witnesses being sent to Canada, allegedly at the behest of Tytler and they would try to bring him back. He had told the court earlier that Tytler had sent Narinder Singh, son of witness Surinder Singh, to Canada and through him the Congress leader was putting pressure on his father to change the statement and depose in his favour. In June 2015, Verma had deposed before the CBI that Tytler had told him in 2008 he had met the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after which he got a clean chit by the CBI over his alleged role in the riots case. In his statement as a witness recorded by the CBI during a probe, Verma, an accused in the naval war room leak and other cases including cheating and forgery, had said Tytler had also told him that a deal was struck and a hefty amount was paid to a riots case witness, who had deposed against him. The CBI's move seeking permission to conduct polygraph test on Tytler and Verma had come in view of the court's December 4, 2015 order in which it was mentioned that the lie-detection test may be conducted, if required. Tytler had refused to undergo the polygraph test. The case pertained to the riots at Gurudwara Pulbangash in North Delhi where three people were killed on November 1, 1984, a day after the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. The victims had filed a protest petition challenging the CBI's closure reports in the case. The court had in December 2015 directed the CBI to further investigate the matter and said it would monitor the probe every two months to ensure that no aspect is left uninvestigated.

Decide 1984 Riots Case Convict's Plea For Parole In 2 Weeks: High Court,Decide 1984 Riots Case Convict's Plea For Parole In 2 Weeks: High Court,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/decide-1984-riots-case-convicts-plea-for-parole-in-2-weeks-says-delhi-high-court-1985674,en,"The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the AAP government to decide in two weeks the parole plea of Balwan Khokhar, who along with former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar was sentenced to life imprisonment in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. Justice Najmi Waziri asked the Delhi government to treat former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar's plea as a representation and to communicate its decision to him in two weeks. With the direction, the court disposed off the petition seeking parole for a month to file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the high court's December 17 decision. The high court on December 17, 2018 had set aside the trial court's verdict, which had acquitted Sajjan Kumar in a case related to killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar Part-I area in Palam Colony in south west Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II during that period. The riots had broken out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards. The high court, in its verdict, had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by the trial court to the other five -- Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and former MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. It had also convicted them for criminal conspiracy to burn down residences of Sikh families and a gurdwara in the area during the riots. The trial court in 2013 had awarded life term to Khokhar, Bhagmal and Lal, and a three-year jail term to Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. Following the high court verdict, life term of Khokhar, Bhagmal and Lal has been upheld and the sentence of Yadav and Kishan Khokar has been enhanced to 10 years in jail. The high court in its judgement had said that the riots were a ""crime against humanity"" perpetrated by those who enjoyed ""political patronage"" and aided by an ""indifferent"" law enforcement agency.

Sajjan Kumar Asked To Appear Before Court On January 28 In Riots Case,Sajjan Kumar Asked To Appear Before Court On January 28 In Riots Case,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/1984-anti-sikh-riots-delhi-court-issues-production-warrant-against-sajjan-kumar-1981348,en,"A Delhi court on Tuesday issued production warrant for January 28 against former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. District Judge Poonam A Bamba issued production warrant against Kumar after Tihar Jail authorities, where he is lodged after conviction in another case related to the riots, could not produce him on Tuesday. In the case before the trial court, three persons - Sajjan Kumar, Brahmanand Gupta and Ved Prakash - are facing trial on charges of murder and rioting pertaining to the killing of Surjit Singh in Delhi's Sultanpuri. The riots broke out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984. The witness, Cham Kaur, had on November 16 last year identified Sajjan Kumar before the court as one who had allegedly instigated the mob to kill Sikhs. Ms Kaur had told the court that she had seen Sajjan Kumar allegedly addressing a crowd in the national capital's Sultanpuri area in 1984. ""On November 1, 1984 when I stepped out to look for my goat, I saw accused Sajjan Kumar addressing the crowd and saying '' hamari ma maar di, Sardaro ko maar do '' (They killed our mother, kill the Sikhs),"" Ms Kaur had told the court. She further said the next morning, her son and father were killed. ""My son Kapoor Singh and my father Sardarji Singh were pulled out of the hiding place on the second floor, beaten badly and thrown down from the roof,"" Ms Kaur had said, adding, she also received injuries in the attack. Before Cham Kaur, another key prosecution witness Sheela Kaur identified Kumar as one who had instigated a crowd in Sultanpuri. The case was transferred from the Karkardooma court to the Patiala House court by the Delhi High Court, which had directed the district judge to video record the proceedings at the cost of the accused. Kumar and the two other accused had said that they were ready to bear the expenses of the videography of proceedings. The proceedings in the case were earlier stayed after the complainant Joginder Singh approached the high court seeking transfer of the case while alleging that evidence was not being properly recorded. The Delhi High Court had on December 17 convicted Kumar and sentenced him to imprisonment for ""remainder of his natural life"" in another 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, saying the riots were a ""crime against humanity"" perpetrated by those who enjoyed ""political patronage"" and aided by an ""indifferent"" law enforcement agency.

The convicts, Umeshbhai Bharwad, Rajkumar, Harshad and Prakashbhai Rathod, are serving a 10-year jail term for arson and rioting. They were convicted by the Gujarat High Court. ""The conviction order is debatable,"" the Supreme Court said while granting them bail on Tuesday. The top court also said it is seized of appeals by others convicted in the case, including Babu Bajrangi. At least 97 Muslims were killed by a mob in Naroda Patiya near Ahmedabad on February 28, 2002, in the communal riots that followed the Godhra train burning in which 59 Hindu train passengers were killed. In June last year, the Gujarat High Court had sentenced the convicts to 10 years rigorous imprisonment, observing that their punishment must be consistent with the brutality of the crime. The high court had convicted 16 people, including Babu Bajrangi, and acquitted 18 others, among them former BJP minister Maya Kodnani. ""The court cannot set aside the agony and anguish of the victims... Offences are not against individuals but society at large and has consequences of polarising society,"" the high court had said on June 25. ""Imposing too lenient a sentence would amount to travesty of justice... Imposition of 10 years of rigorous imprisonment would be adequate punishment,"" the court held. The court further observed that any liberal attitude with respect to such offences would be ""counter-productive"" and ""against the interest of society.""

Numerous Facebook pages entitled ""Support for Christophe Dettinger"" have also been set up, with one such page showing it had more than 3,000 Facebook ""likes"". Dettinger turned himself in on Monday, saying he was defending himself. He remains in police custody. Dettinger, who was twice national light-heavyweight champion, was caught on camera jumping over the railings of a pedestrian bridge blocked by baton-wielding police before swinging blows at the officers, forcing them to retreat.

But the three-time Chief Minister of Delhi has backed her colleague saying he hasn't been charged for anything. Plus he is a Congressman who has every right to attend a party event, she clarified. ""There is no controversy at all. Has he been charged for anything? Has he gone to jail? He hasn't left the party. He hasn't been chucked out of the Congress. He came there like any other Congressman. So why is everybody making an issue out of it, I don't understand,"" Ms Dikshit told NDTV. The 80-year-old also lashed out at those trying to weave a controversy around Jagdish Tytler's attendance. ""Perhaps they didn't have anything negative to write about that meeting so they picked this up as something important,"" she said. Jagdish Tytler also said that the charges against him have not been proved. ""What can a man say when the court has given a verdict. You also mention my name. Why? Is there an FIR? Is there a case? No? Then why do you take my name? Someone said that and you believed it,"" he told reporters indignantly. Jagdish Tytler, a 1984 riots-accused, was present as Sheila Dikshit took charge as Delhi Congress chief. A former union minister and a known face from the national capital, Jagdish Tytler has been a dilemma for the Congress. He along with former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar was accused by riot victims of leading mobs against Sikhs in Delhi following the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984. At least 3,000 people were killed in the violence over the next four days. He was inducted into Manmohan Singh's cabinet in 2004, but had to quit for his alleged role in the 1984 riots. Last month, after Sajjan Kumar was convicted and ordered to spend life in prison by the Delhi High Court, demands for action against Jagdish Tytler and Kamal Nath, another Congress leader, re-emerged. But Kamal Nath, who was also named by witnesses, was picked by Congress chief Rahul Gandhi as Madhya Pradesh chief minister prompting the BJP, the Akalis, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and others to target the party for allegedly shielding its leaders accused in the anti-Sikh riots. Arvind Kejriwal's AAP alleged that it exposed Congress's anti-Sikh face and demanded that the party leaders clear their stand on Jagdish Tytler. ""Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi, Tytler was their right hand man. It is a clear signal to Sikhs of the country,"" Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said. BJP lawmaker and Akali Dal leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa also alleged that the incident was an act to intimidate witnesses in anti-Sikh riot cases. ""The Congress wants to send a message to the witnesses that the party high command supports Tytler and nobody should even try to testify against him,"" alleged Mr Sirsa.

Mr Tytler, 74, was seen in the front rows, which provoked criticism that the Congress was ""again rubbing salt into the wounds of Sikhs"". ""Why should he not come, we are privileged to have him here,"" Ms Dikshit said in a comment that was instantly attacked. Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, an ally of the ruling BJP, said: ""Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi, Tytler was their right hand man. It is a clear signal to Sikhs of the country."" Another leader of her Akali Dal, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said the Congress deliberately had Mr Tytler in the forefront to intimidate 1984 witnesses. ""The Congress wants to send a message to the witnesses that the party high command supports Tytler and nobody should even try to testify against him,"" he said. Mr Tytler, a former union minister, has been a persistent embarrassment for the Congress , which has been pummelled by the BJP, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and other parties over allegations of shielding its leaders accused in the anti-Sikh riots. At least 3,000 people were killed in the violence that erupted in the aftermath of the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984. Mr Tytler argues that the charges against him have not been proved. ""What can a man say when the Court has given a verdict. You also mention my name. Why? Is there an FIR? Is there a case? No? Then why do you take my name? Someone said that and you believed it,"" he told reporters indignantly. But he has been accused by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of inciting a mob that killed three persons. The CBI later tried to close the case but the court has not accepted it. Mr Tytler became a minister in the Manmohan Singh government in 2004 but had to quit as the 1984 riot allegations kept dogging him. The allegations came back to haunt the party after another riot-accused leader, Sajjan Kumar, was sentenced to life in jail in December by the Delhi High Court, which cancelled an earlier court order letting him off. Mr Tytler and Sajjan Kumar were both accused by riot victims of leading mobs and goading them to target Sikhs in Delhi. Kamal Nath, another Congress leader whose name has come up in witness accounts, faced protests after he was picked by party president Rahul Gandhi as Madhya Pradesh chief minister. In April last, Mr Tytler and Sajjan Kumar were asked to leave the stage before Rahul Gandhi's arrival for a protest fast at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial Rajghat in Delhi. They were ordered to sit below, with ordinary Congress workers. Get the latest election news , live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

The case related to a protest against illicit liquor at Hosur in 1998. P Balakrishna Reddy submitted his resignation to chief minister K Palaniswami who forwarded it to Governor Banwarilal Purohit who has accepted it. His portfolio of Youth Welfare and Sports Development has been handed over to School Education minister KA Sengottaiyan. ""..Governor of Tamil Nadu has accepted the resignation of P Balakrishna Reddy, from the Council of Ministers,"" a Raj Bhavan release said Monday night. ""Based on the recommendation of the Chief Minister, the Portfolio of Youth Welfare and Sports Development has been allocated to KA Sengottaiyan, Minister for School Education who shall be re-designated as Minister for School Education, Youth Welfare and Sports Development,"" the release said. In a jolt to the AIADMK government, a special court Monday sentenced Reddy to three years rigorous imprisonment in a two-decades old riot case related to a protest against illicit liquor in Hosur. Reddy, then a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member, was convicted by a special judge in the case related to the protest staged on September 30, 1998. The judge, however, accepted a plea of the minister's counsel and stayed the sentence enabling him to file an appeal in the Madras High Court. Opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president MK Stalin demanded Reddy's dismissal from the ministry, describing his conviction as a as a ""shame"" for the ruling AIADMK led by Chief Minister K Palaniswami. Besides Reddy, who represents Hosur constituency in the assembly, the court sentenced 14 other accused in the case to three years rigorous imprisonment. First accused Govinda Reddy, who had led the demonstration organised by the Krishnagiri unit of BJP, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. All the accused, including the minister, were present in the court. Speaking to reporters later, the minister said he would file an appeal in the high court on Tuesday. ""In 1998, over 30 people died after consuming spurious liquor. Following that a road blockade was held and the case was filed in connection with that,"" he said. Reddy faces disqualification as a lawmaker in view of the conviction unless it is stayed by a higher court. Under Section 8(3) of the RPA, a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified for that period and a further six years after release. According to the prosecution, during the demonstration held by the locals in Hosur in Krishnagiri district, about 300 km from Chennai, the protesters allegedly went on the rampage and clashed with police, damaging several vehicles. Three policemen were grievously injured, five buses were destroyed in stone pelting and a police vehicle and a bike were burnt in the violence. Subsequently, a complaint was registered against 108 people, including Reddy, for various Indian Penal Code offences including rioting and wrongful restraint and under the Tamil Nadu Public Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act. During the pendency of the trial, as many as 27 accused died. Reddy, who was arraigned as the 72nd accused, had later joined the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). He was elected from the Hosur assembly constituency in the 2016 elections. The trial, proceeding in a local court, was transferred to the special court set up in September last year following a Supreme Court order to expedite cases against elected representatives. In its first conviction, the special court had on December 28 held former DMK MLA guilty in a rape case and sentenced him to ten years rigorous imprisonment.

After recent conviction of former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, Mr Phoolka quit AAP, saying the focus next will be on Jagdish Tytler and Kamal Nath - two other senior leaders of the Congress whom eyewitnesses had accused of being involved in the riots. HS Phoolka said he and BJP's Vijay Goel were ""good friends and meet often"" Kamal Nath has been recently named the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. AAP has been divided over its fresh stance regarding Congress after it was co-opted into the proposed united opposition front against the BJP.

There were reports that lawmaker Alka Lamba, who was adamant on passing the resolution recommending the withdrawal of the late Prime Minister's award, was asked to resign. The legislator, who ultimately did not resign, claimed her decision to not support it had angered party colleagues. Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia later clarified that there was no mention of Rajiv Gandhi in the original resolution and the addition was hand written by a legislator. Mr Phoolka said the fight for the 1984 riots victims was his ""life's mission"". ""Sajjan Kumar's conviction has been a huge victory for all of us.

The stinging attack came a day after PM Modi's outburst against the Congress on loan waiver, 1984 riots and other issues. Mr Singh challenged the prime minister to cite ""even one instance of a promise fulfilled by his government in the past five years"". ""The '' jumlebaaz '' prime minister has brought the nation to its nadir with his deceptions and fabrications, and was staring at his moment of judgement at the hands of the people, who are set to throw him out of power for good,"" he said while referring to PM Modi's Gurdaspur rally on Thursday. ""One wonders with what face Modi intends to go back to the people of India to seek re-election a few weeks from now,"" he quipped, dubbing the prime minister ""the worst leader India has seen since Independence"". The Punjab chief minister minced no words in taking on PM Modi over the 1984 anti-Sikh riots issue, questioning the PM's ""studious silence on the BJP/RSS workers named in the Tilak Marg police station FIR related to the worst violence perpetrated against the Sikhs, while trying desperately to drag the Gandhi family into the matter even though no fingers had been pointed at them"". At the Gurdaspur rally, PM Modi had attacked the Congress on several issues. He had accused the Congress of protecting those involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The senior Congress leader also took a dig at the prime minister over the latter ""taking credit"" for the Kartarpur Corridor issue. On the crop loan waiver issue, Mr Singh said despite the fiscal mess inherited by his government from the previous SAD-BJP regime, Punjab had managed to waive Rs 3,417 crore of crop loans of 4,14,275 farmers in just one year. ""Another 3 lakh farmers will be given crop loan waiver to the tune of about Rs 4,000 crore soon,"" he said.

The former legislator from Punjab, who was the leader of opposition for some time, said that AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had tried to stop him, but he insisted on leaving the party . He also clarified that he won't be contesting the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Mr Phoolka, who has been representing victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in courts for the last three decades, said the biggest reason behind his decision to exit politics was his wish to dedicate all his time to social work. He was 28 in 1984 and had just started practising law when around 3,000 people were killed when mobs led by Congress leaders targeted Sikhs after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31. Moved by the plight of the families of the victims, he decided to fight for them for free. ""We took on former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government which was so powerful. We never thought any Sikh would stand against it. But we got support from civil society, human rights groups, media and we won the fight with Sajjan Kumar 's conviction. We have more such fights to win,"" he said. The 63-year-old now wants to start a movement like the one started by activist Anna Hazare in 2012. Many who eventually left the AAP, including lawyers and doctors, need to get together to shape a movement parallel to political parties, he said. ""Converting anti-corruption movement into a political party in 2012 was wrong,"" he said at the Press Club of India in Delhi. The AAP was formed by Arvind Kejriwal and others following the anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare. Mr Phoolka said that it was a huge movement and it was difficult to ignore. ""Political parties had to listen to us. Now we need a doosri (second) Anna movement, a parallel force that isn't scared to call a spade a spade,"" he said. Mr Phoolka's resignation from the AAP had come amid speculation of a possible alliance between the Congress and the AAP for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In the last one year, he didn't participate in any of the party's activities and stayed away from politics. But he refused to comment on Arvind Kejriwal, the AAP and the party's flip-flop on a resolution aimed at withdrawing late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Bharat Ratna over his alleged failure to contain violence in 1984. ""To fight for 1984 riots victims is my life's mission. Sajjan Kumar's conviction has been a huge victory for all of us.

Rajiv Gandhi's Name Should Be Included In 1984 Riot Cases: Sukhbir Badal,Rajiv Gandhi's Name Should Be Included In 1984 Riot Cases: Sukhbir Badal,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rajiv-gandhis-name-should-be-included-in-1984-riot-cases-sukhbir-singh-badal-1972315,en,"Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday demanded that former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's name should be included in cases related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The former Punjab deputy chief minister alleged that accounts of witnesses had made it clear that Rajiv Gandhi was ""behind"" the riots. ""Rajiv Gandhi's name should be included in the cases registered in connection with the 1984 riots. Rajiv's name should also be removed from all awards and institutions,"" he said addressing a gathering in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gurdaspur. ""Recent developments as well as accounts of witnesses has made it clear that Rajiv Gandhi was behind the 1984 riots,"" Mr Badal claimed. The Congress has consistently denied its leadership's role in the riots. The NDA government established a Special Investigation Team to probe the 1984 riot cases. There have been convictions in the matter, he said. The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre has resolved several pending issues of the Sikh community, Mr Badal added. Targeting Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, the SAD leader alleged that he has gone back on his promise of complete farm loan waiver and betrayed the farmers of Punjab. Like the loan waiver in Punjab, those promised by Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh is also a ""hoax"", Mr Badal alleged. Prime Minister Modi has not only fast-tracked development and infrastructure projects in Punjab, but also resolved long pending issues of the Sikh community, he said. Mr Badal said be it investments on creating a world-class road network or building new airports, sanctioning an IIM at Amritsar and AIIMS at Bathinda or releasing funds for the Shahpur Kandi dam, the NDA government has always kept Punjab first. This is unlike of previous Congress governments which have always discriminated against Punjab and its people, he alleged. ""If Punjab has got something it is only at the hands of non-Congress governments at the Centre,"" Mr Badal said.

"" Neta kyun nahi marta (why don't leaders die?)"" Mr Rajbhar questioned at his rally in Aligarh on Sunday. ""Did any big politician die in Hindu-Muslim riots? Why don't politicians die? Set fire to politicians who try to make you fight on the basis on religion; then they will understand and stop 'burning' others,"" Mr Rajbhar said. The minister, who has often been critical of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, went on to say that ""Netas create divisions between Hindus and Muslims"" although the constitution deems any person eligible to cast his vote a citizen of India and ""they can't be thrown out"". On Saturday, Mr Rajbhar had threatened to pull out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Mr Rajbhar's remarks came as the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) joined hands to take on the BJP in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The rebel UP minister has given the BJP a deadline to decide whether it wants to jointly fight the general election. Mr Rajbhar said if he did not get a suitable response, his party - the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) would contest all 80 seats solo. The rebel BJP ally had launched a scathing attack on Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, after the latter went on a renaming spree. He had asked the BJP to change the names of its Muslim leaders before changing the names of places. ""BJP changed the names of Mughalsarai and Faizabad. They say they were named after the Mughals. They have a national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain, union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Uttar Pradesh minister Mohsin Raza - three Muslim faces of the BJP.

""I have resigned from AAP and handed over resignation to Kejriwal ji today. Though he asked me not to resign but I insisted,"" tweeted Mr Phoolka, who had joined the party in 2014. Mr Phoolka added that he will brief the media tomorrow to explain why he is leaving AAP and his further plans. Sources close to Mr Phoolka say that he has been upset with the party since the whole controversy regarding an amendment aimed at withdrawing late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Bharat Ratna over his alleged failure to contain violence in 1984. The party's flip-flop on the resolution could be one of the reasons why Mr Phoolka decided to leave, they added. Mr Phoolka had stepped down as a Punjab legislator in October last year demanding immediate action in the sacrilege of the Sikh holy book the Guru Granth Sahib in Punjab in 2015. Mr Phoolka had claimed that the Congress government had not taken the desired action against those named in the findings of the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission's report on the sacrilege incidents. The panel was tasked to probe the cases of sacrilege as well as a firing incident in Faridkot in which two Sikh protesters were killed. In 2017, when the Delhi Bar Council stopped him from appearing in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases against Sajjan Kumar and others, saying he enjoyed an office of profit, Mr Phoolka had quit as the leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly to continue his fight for justice. The 63-year-old lawyer had said he had been fighting the cases for a long time, and they had reached a very ""crucial"" stage. ""Will not give up '84 carnage cases. Would rather quit as minister. My presence in anti-Sikh riots cases is important at this stage; that is why I decided to quit as the leader of opposition,"" he had said. At least 3,000 people were killed when mobs led by some Congress leaders targeted Sikhs after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31. Last month, after former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar was convicted for the murder of five members of a family in Delhi's Raj Nagar and the torching of a gurdwara on November 1, 1984, Mr Phoolka got emotional and said, ""It's a huge victory. This moment has come after 34 years."" Sajjan Kumar was sent to the Mandoli jail in east Delhi on December 31, the day he surrendered . But the former minister has challenged his conviction and jail sentence by the Delhi High Court in the Supreme Court.

PM Modi said the Congress in Punjab, too, had made big promises to farmers, but deceived them after coming to power. ""The Congress had made tall promises to farmers on loan waiver, but later deceived them,"" he said at a rally in Gurdaspur. ""The Congress is also awarding those involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots with chief minister's post,"" he said. ""On one family's direction, the files of those involved in the riots were put under wraps, but the NDA dug them out and set up an SIT. The results are before you,"" PM Modi said. He said the NDA government took a historic decision to build the Kartarpur Corridor to link the Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan's Kartarpur, the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev.

""Although a certain family had given a clean chit to certain people involved in the riots -- even burying their files after calling them ' sajjan ' (gentlemen) -- my government dug them out for a through probe by a special investigation team. The results are there for everybody to see,"" he said at the rally in Punjab's Gurdaspur. He was punning on the name of Sajjan Kumar, a Congress leader who was recently sentenced to life imprisonment for his involvement in the violence that followed the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984. PM Modi also criticised the Congress for appointing Kamal Nath, a former accused in the anti-Sikh riots, as the Madhya Pradesh chief minister. ""These people not only shielded those involved in killing hundreds of innocent Sikhs in Delhi but also rewarded one of them with chief ministership,"" he said. Although Mr Nath was allegedly seen directing a mob at the time, he was let off by the courts for lack of evidence. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor recently said he should be given the same ""benefit of doubt"" accorded to PM Modi in connection with his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The Prime Minister then proceeded to slam the farm loan waivers announced by the Congress in various states under its rule. ""For years, the Congress cheated the country in the name of 'garibi hatao'. Now it is cheating farmers in the name of loan waivers,"" PM Modi said. ""They are only interested in politics of lies and cheating. It is misleading farmers in the name of loan waivers."" The BJP-led NDA will face a resurgent Congress in the Lok Sabha elections next year, after upset defeats in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. It had lost Punjab to the Amarinder Singh-led party by nearly 60 seats last year. PM Modi cited several examples to drive home his allegation of the Congress being anti-farmer. ""They promised to waive loans if voted to power in Punjab, but the truth turned out to be something else. As per their own records, only loans worth Rs 3,400 crore were waived in one-and-a-half years. Is loan waiver a five-year plan for the Congress? Will they give the loan waiver after the farmer's dead?"" He said that the BJP, on the other hand, was working hard to bring all-round development in rural India. ""We will double farmers' income by 2022. We want to empower them into becoming self-reliant,"" he said. The Prime Minister also accused the Congress of compromising national security by raising ""baseless charges"" of corruption and irregularities in the Rafale fighter jet deal. ""The Congress is playing with national security. They are spreading lies for the benefit of one family,"" he alleged. The Congress is demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into the multi-crore Rafale deal with French firm Dassault Aviation, alleging corruption and crony capitalism.

"Fukrey Returns Movie Review: Hunny, Choocha And Gang Return - But Should They Have?","Fukrey Returns Movie Review: Hunny, Choocha And Gang Return - But Should They Have?",https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/fukrey-returns-movie-review-hunny-choocha-and-gang-return-but-should-they-have-1785138,en,"Cast: Pulkit Samrat, Manjot Singh, Ali Fazal, Varun Sharma, Richa Chadda, Priya Anand, Vishakha Singh and Pankaj Tripathi Director: Mrighdeep Singh Lamba Rating: 2 stars (out of 5) Call it what you will - deja vu or deja choo - it is written all over every single frame of Fukrey Returns . The film is unable to shake off the effects of the law of diminishing returns. It's more of the same but with markedly less impact. The slacker comedy, like the boys that it is about, drifts aimlessly from one gag to another, with a caged tiger and its cuddly cub serving as the fulcrum. Add to that a King Cobra for good measure. Sadly, Fukrey Returns lacks the animal instinct to heave itself out of its trough . It does has some deliriously funny moments - most of them emanating from the chubby and guileless Choocha's actions and utterances - but its flaccid stretches are one too many and they rob the film of any realistic chance of pulling off a repeat act. Fukrey Returns comes nowhere near being the rip-roaring ride that the 2013 sleeper hit Fukrey , at least in parts, was. Director Mrighdeep Singh Lamba and co-writer Vipul Vig, juggling with elements that have clearly lost their sheen, fail to rustle up anything that could be described as refreshing. The fact that the screenplay does not accord balanced treatment to the oddball characters that pumped life into the first film does not help matters either.  Fukrey Returns Movie Review: A still from the film. (Image courtesy: YouTube ) Fukrey Returns starts off with a zingy opening-credits number that provides a brief recap of the story so far. Fair enough but not good enough. The film's frequent throwbacks to the past is bound to throw off those that haven't seen - or remember - Fukrey . The screenplay proceeds on the assumption that the audience, down to the last member, is familiar with all the characters and their back stories. That is likely to leave many gaps in comprehension for those that aren't fully acquainted with the world of Fukrey . In the film's bizarre first sequence, we watch Choocha and Hunny taking a dump in a forested area off the river Yamuna. Hunny begins to whistle in the woods. Don't, Choocha warns him, or a snake will slither our way. Lo and behold, the sibilant appears out of the undergrowth, bites Hunny on the bum, and assumes the form of Bholi Punjaban. Hunny is out of the way, and you now have me all for yourself, the snake-woman exults. Choocha is understandably thrilled to bits. But the joy is short-lived. His post-dawn reverie is rudely interrupted by a sandal hurled at him by his angry mother. Between these weird dreams and risky misadventures, the Fukrey boys of east Delhi are pushed to the wall by the feisty Bholi Punjaban, the reigning queen of the Trans-Yamuna underworld. They are once again engaged in hatching get rich quick plans and flirting with danger, but nothing that they do can whip up the sense of edgy urgency of the past. They seem to be merely going through the motions as Fukrey Returns wends its way to a huge letdown of a climax.  Fukrey Returns Movie Review: A still from the film. (Image courtesy: YouTube ) The novelty has worn off and the dreams of Choocha that yielded several lottery wins on the back of Hunny's freewheeling but spot-on interpretations no longer sound either convincing or intriguing. The attempts to squeeze humour out of the camaraderie of the boys amid the many setbacks that they suffer, therefore, fall rather flat. Hunny (Pulkit Samrat), Zafar (Ali Fazal) and Lali (Manjot Singh) are reduced to glorified hangers-on - and the girlfriends of the first two (Priya Anand's Priya and Vishakha Singh's Neetu) fare much worse - as Choocha (Varun Sharma) and Pandit (Pankaj Tripathi) have their stocks appreciably enhanced in this follow-up that struggles to find a narrative sweet spot. It never does. As a result, the Panditji's laconic wisecracks and Choocha's chatter do not add up to much beyond a few, stray chuckles.  Fukrey Returns Movie Review: A still from the film. (Image courtesy: YouTube ) Fukrey Returns has a full-fledged baddie in the person of Delhi government minister Babulal Bhatia (Rajiv Gupta), who helps Bholi Punjaban cut short her prison term. The pound of flesh that he demands from her pushes her, her two African henchmen and a pair of pliable zoo employees Changu and Mangu into acts of indiscretion that spell trouble for the titular protagonists. The boys, presumed dead, are compelled to go into hiding, with hordes of angry Ponzi scheme investors baying for their blood. The wily, smooth-talking political scamster, who clandestinely runs a shady lottery business and has his sights set on the chief minister's chair, steps up to the plate and offers to bail out the boys in a soup, but once again for a price. But Panditji has other ideas. That sets off another chain of events that lead the gang into an underground tunnel and from thence to an abandoned rail yard.

The event, at PM Modi's residence, was attended by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and other Sikh dignitaries. With Dr Singh in the audience, PM Modi targeted the Congress on multiple fronts, saying the Sikh gurus ""taught us to be on the side of justice"". The central government, he said, is ""trying to get justice for the people who suffered during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots"". Sikhs have regarded the conviction of former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots as a case of delayed justice. Around 3,000 Sikhs were killed in Delhi in the days after then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi  was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984. Today, PM Modi also flagged the Kartarpur Corridor as an achievement of his government, saying the followers of Guru Nanak ji now won't have to look through a telescope for darshan (view) of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, one of the holiest Sikh shrines, where Guru Nanak Dev spent 18 years of his life. Claiming that the ""mistake"" of 1947 has been rectified , PM Modi said that the ""most significant Sikh shrine"" was ""just a few kilometres away but even then it was ignored,"" and as an act of ""atonement"", the central government is helping build the road link to Kartarpur. Pakistan has expressed hopes that the Kartarpur corridor will lead to bilateral talks, but India has been firm. Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said a dialogue between the two nations ""is not connected with only the Kartarpur corridor... The moment Pakistan stops terrorist activities in India, the dialogue can start"". In December, while campaigning for the assembly elections in Rajasthan, PM Modi had said ""correcting the Congress' mistakes was my destiny."" He alleged that Congress leaders at the time had ""no idea about the importance of Guru Nanak Dev"" and no respect for Sikh sentiment. The Prime Minister described Guru Gobind Singh as a warrior and a poet and said his government now plans to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak across the country. Not only events will be held in the states, Indian embassies abroad will also organise programmes as part of the celebrations.
