""We will not have a transitional (civilian) structure without representatives from the armed groups,"" said Khalid Omar Yousef, a leader from the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella group which has led the protest movement. He did not name specific armed groups. Since 2003, Sudan has been rocked by rebellions in Darfur , South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions. Tens of thousands of people have died in those areas since ethnic minority rebels picked up arms against the Arab-dominated forces of Bashir, accusing his administration of political and economic marginalisation. In recent years, the violence has waned as rebels and Khartoum reached a series of ceasefires, but none of the rebel groups joined a civilian administration during Bashir's iron-fisted rule. Many Darfuris feel that their demand for justice for Bashir-era officials should be a bigger priority for protest leaders. Three armed groups are currently part of the Alliance for Freedom and Change which spearheaded protests since December that led to the ouster of Bashir. The Alliance is now demanding that the military council which took Bashir's place be replaced by a joint civilian-military council, although they say the number of members is yet to be finalised. On Thursday protest leaders presented the council with a proposal for the new civilian structures they want see rule the country. Protest leader Satea al-Haj told reporters that the transitional civilian government should be of 17 ministers, while the legislative body should include 120 to 150 members. He said the alliance was expecting a response from the military council in ""48 to 72 hours"". ",02 May 2019,2019-05-02 17:54:52

Weeks of demonstrations forced Bouteflika out of office on April 2 after 20 years in power. Protesters have continued mass demonstrations every Friday, demanding other members of the country's elite also give way. They are calling for the resignation of the interim president, Abdelkader Bensalah, who is serving for 90 days until an election on July 4, and of Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui, appointed by Bouteflika days before he stepped down. ""You must go"" and ""Thieves you have destroyed the country"", read banners held up by protesters. The army remains the most powerful institution in Algeria, having swayed politics from the shadows for decades. It has so far patiently monitored the mostly peaceful protests that at times have swelled to hundreds of thousands of people. Last week the army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah - who helped push out Bouteflika after having him declared unfit for office - said several big corruption cases would come to light in a crackdown on graft. A number of figures from the ruling elite including the finance minister, former prime minister and several rich businessmen have come under investigation in recent weeks.

Maduro hangs on as Venezuelan protests peter out,Maduro hangs on as Venezuelan protests peter out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/maduro-hangs-on-as-venezuelan-protests-peter-out/articleshow/69138235.cms,en,"CARACAS: Venezuelans heeded opposition leader Juan Guaido 's call to take to the streets on Wednesday in a bid to force President Nicolas Maduro from power, but there was little concrete sign of change in a crisis that increasingly looks like a political stalemate. Guaido had called for the ""largest march"" in Venezuela's history and said on Twitter that ""millions of Venezuelans"" were in the streets in ""this final phase"" of his move to oust Maduro. But by late afternoon, many of the protesters in the capital Caracas had drifted home. National Guards fired tear gas at a hardcore of demonstrators who remained, and one injured demonstrator was carried by others to a first aid truck, Reuters video showed. Local rights organizations said a young woman died in surgery after being shot in the head during a protest in Caracas . Guaido confirmed via Twitter that a woman died after being shot. The standoff in Venezuela increased tensions between the United States and Russia, who accused each other of interference in the OPEC-member nation's affairs. Despite Guaido's calls for the military to support him, the armed forces leadership has so far remained loyal to Maduro, who has been in power since his mentor, the late President Hugo Chavez, died in 2013. ""If the regime thought we had reached maximum pressure, they cannot even imagine,"" Guaido told thousands of cheering supporters. ""We have to remain in the streets."" It was unclear what more Guaido can do at this point. The Venezuelan opposition has often staged huge street protests against Maduro but failed to dislodge him despite a deep economic recession and hyperinflation. Demonstrators said they were prepared for the process of ousting Maduro to last a long time. ""We need to keep going,"" said Laila Amezquita, a 52-year-old nurse from Caracas' downtown Candelaria district. ""In three months Guaido's been able to do what they have not done in 20 years, and one has to be patient."" Others are frustrated that nothing has changed more than three months after Guaido, head of the opposition-run National Assembly, invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate. Guaido is recognized as Venezuela's legitimate head of state by the United States, the European Union and others, while Maduro is backed by countries including Russia, China, and Cuba. U.S.-RUSSIA FRICTION Those fault lines are increasingly putting Venezuela at the heart of global geopolitical tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration has imposed sanctions on the Maduro government and refused to rule out military intervention, although it says it prefers a peaceful transition. ""Military action is possible. If that's what's required, that's what the United States will do,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox Business Network. The Pentagon appeared to downplay any active preparations to directly intervene in Venezuela, but acknowledged detailed contingency planning. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Pompeo on Wednesday that further ""aggressive steps"" in Venezuela would have grave consequences, Russia's Foreign Ministry said. In turn, the United States has accused Moscow of interfering in the South American country, an ally of Russia since the time of Chavez. Pompeo said Maduro had been expected to flee the country on Tuesday but Russia convinced him to stay, which the Kremlin has denied. White House national security adviser John Bolton, a foreign policy hawk, said Moscow's involvement was not welcome. ""This is our hemisphere,"" he told reporters outside the White House. ""It's not where the Russians ought to be interfering. This is a mistake on their part. It's not going to lead to an improvement of relations."" TEST FOR GUAIDO Maduro retains control of state institutions and the loyalty of the armed forces, frustrating Guaido's bid to assume the day-to-day functions of government, which he says would be a prelude to calling new elections. Seeking to appeal to Maduro's traditional base among the working class, Guaido said on Wednesday he would consider a proposal from public workers to call for a series of stoppages leading up to a general strike. Carlos Alberto, a 70-year-old small-business owner, draped in a Venezuelan flag at the Caracas protest, said: ""We are tired of this regime, that has brutally impoverished us. My children and almost all my family have already left Venezuela. ... We know that if it's not today, it will be tomorrow, because this has to end."" Venezuelan living standards have declined even further in the first several months of the year, with blackouts and water shortages adding to hyperinflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine that have prompted millions to emigrate. Triple the usual daily number of Venezuelans fled across the border to Brazil on Tuesday, Brazilian government data showed. Maduro, who says Guaido is a puppet of the United States seeking to orchestrate a coup, also called a march on Wednesday. In a speech to supporters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace, Maduro said he recognized the need for ""big changes within the Bolivarian revolution."" He did not give details. Traveling to the pro-Maduro rally, educator Mercedes Martinez called Guaido a ""lapdog"" and said: ""The empire wants to smother us, cut off our head and colonize us. ... The people of Venezuela are defending Venezuela."" ",02 May 2019,2019-05-02 03:04:32

UT Engineering department is handling the project which is being funded by National Highway Authority of India. TOI tried to contact chief engineer , Mukesh Anand , by calling and texting him message to take his version on the matter, but he did not respond. Gunjan Rastogi, member of organisation ‘Watch the Footprint’ said, “None of us is anti-development but we want a model of sustainable development where both development and our environment can co-exist with each other. The concerned department must see if they can make changes in the project to save the trees.” Ravinder Nath, who is involved with organisation Environment Society of India is disappointed with the lack luster attitude of the officials. “It is unfortunate that administration does not pay heed to the outcry of public protest for saving trees felling . We staged similar protests against felling of trees when a flyover project near KC theatre was conceived but it was enforced ultimately .” However there are hopes that authorities may not be able to push the matter under the carpet anymore. Rajnish Watts, former principal of Chandigarh College of Architecture and member of Chandigarh Heritage Committee and president of Chandigarh Tree Lovers told TOI, “It was a year ago , a team of UT Engineering department had discussed the project with the members of Chandigarh Heritage Committee where they had assured us minimum felling of trees without exactly divulging the numbers exactly. Since the matter is now before media talking about felling of large number of trees , we will soon hold a meeting with the department to get to know the reality from them.” Talking about the two species of old trees Arjan and Mango which have been earmarked fro felling, he said that Arjan trees existed either near airport and Tribune access point and in sector 27 only in the city while mango orchards have already been shrunk to build Industrial area where most of this buffer zone is already gone. On the issue of building flyover in the city, he said, flyover is not the full-proof answer to the problem of traffic increase as it resolves the problem at one point only. Madhu Sareen, prominent environmentalist took up the debate further saying, “Flyover create nuisance for the pedestrians and create mess on the road. This is the reason in European countries , they are doing away with flyovers. In city like London, where I lived for 10 years, they made public buses so comfortable and convenient and plying private cars so expensive that people used public transport. Therefore , instead of flyover which do not serve much purpose and involves lots of costing, we must rather invest in strong network of good public buses to meet the demand of a small city like Chandigarh.” ",01 May 2019,2019-05-01 15:38:08

The pro-VC had told TOI last week that they were examining the issue and would take any decision appropriately. The harried students claimed that in the April 15 paper, two units — frequency selective networks and filters and attenuators — were not covered. On the other hand, there were four questions from first unit despite there being a rule that only two questions can be given from a particular unit. “This disruption in the question paper pattern completely changes the importance of a specific topic which was evened out by the rules,” they said. The students complained that they can’t be expected to solve questions which were out of their curriculum. “All the discrepancies, if combined, amounted to at least 35-40 marks. Due to the mismanagement of the college, we are suffering ultimately and fear of failing in the paper. Re-examination is only alternative now to save our precious academic careers,” they said. NU exam section officials earlier said that out of the many students who appeared for the examination, only a few were seeking re-examination, which puts them in a difficult position. They claimed that in such cases, a conclusive measure could be drawn out only after the correction of the question papers. After evaluating the difficulty faced by students in attempting the paper, NU will come out with an answer to whether a re-examination is needed or not, they said. ",01 May 2019,2019-05-01 05:34:11

Only 15 farmers and two activists could file papers as they were unable to produce 10 proposers each. A candidate from a recognised national or state party needs one proposer while an independent needs 10 proposers at the time of nomination. The proposers must be from the constituency the candidate wishes to contest from. On Monday, the last date for filing nominations for Varanasi which goes to the polls on May 19, only 15 farmers from Telangana and Tamil Nadu were able to file their nominations. Those turned away staged a dharna in front of the Varanasi collectorate and threatened to take the matter to EC. “They have imposed rules which are not prescribed by the EC. They insisted that we physically present the 10 proposers and that their mere signatures or thumb impressions will not do. This is not part of the rules and the whole move appears to have been created to prevent us from contesting,” said Deivasigamani PK, a farmer from Tamil Nadu and president of Turmeric Farmers Association. The farmers said they were hounded by local authorities for three days and not allowed to get local proposers. “Officials insisted we physically present proposers.

However, Congress and other parties said their maha dharna was a grand success as they thwarted attempts by the TRS government to suppress their voice. State BJP president K Laxman, who launched an indefinite hunger strike outside the party office in the morning in protest against the Intermediate exam results fiasco, was taken away by police and later admitted to a hospital. Preventive arrests were largely made in Hyderabad, Rangareddy and almost all other districts. The leaders condemned the ‘dictatorial’ attitude of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for suppressing their voice against failures of his government. They said the government cannot wash its hands of the muddle by taking action against ‘small fish’ while leaving out the ‘big fish’ responsible for the goof-up and suicides by students. AICC secretary V Hanumantha Rao threw a challenge at TRS working president KT Rama Rao to come to Peddamma temple in Jubilee Hills on Tuesday and swear on goddess that he does not know Globarena technologies as claimed by him during an interaction with the citizens on Twitter. Former minister J Geetha Reddy said she along with other women leaders were bundled into a van by male cops. “It is highly condemnable,” she said and demanded that names of politicians who had connection with Globarena Technologies be made public and education minister G Jagadish Reddy be sacked. CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, who is touring assembly constituencies of Congress MLAs who have defected to TRS, said: “The government is focusing on purchasing MLAs as a result of which it does not have control over BIE that had resulted in the goof-up.” ",30 Apr 2019,2019-04-30 06:01:49

The employees downed the signalling system and damaged a fire alarm at Thirumangalam station throwing services out of gear. Commuters complained that trains were delayed for 10 minutes and there was no information about services displayed on information boards at stations late in the evening on Airport to Central and Washermenpet to Airport lines. Commuters had to wait more than 25 minutes for a train at Airport metro station. ""A train, which left the station at 8.50pm, took almost an hour to reach Ekattuthangal station. The train waited for 10 minutes at each station and there were no announcements,"" said Gayathri Srinivasan, a commuter. ""Many people who had reached the metro station from the airport had to look for other modes of transport as there was no information about trains,"" said a commuter. Trains on the DMS to airport line didn't have station display inside coaches and no announcements inside trains and at stations. Trains also halted longer at stations.

""The terminated staff had an option of appealing to the MD. But we were not allowed to meet him. So, we staged a protest,"" he added.

The residents complained that the liquor shop would be a cause of nuisance in the area, which is predominantly a residential locality, and gathered in front of the commercial complex where the establishment in question is operating out of, and demanded its closure. Corporators Lakshmi Shivanna, Subaiah, KV Sridhar, Prema Shankaregowda, Vedavathi, Pramila Bharat were among those who lent support to the residents’ protest. They were joined by former councillors Shivanna and Mahadevappa. The protesters said that the authorities were reluctant to act against the liquor outlet since it was owned by a prominent businessman in Mysuru. “The outlet is situated opposite a park, frequented by the young and old alike. Many of us take our morning and evening strolls in the park. What is more, a school is a stone’s throw away from the liquor store, and students will have to walk past this establishment every day,” the residents said. They added that the commercial complex also housed a provision store, a beauty parlour and other outlets frequented regularly by residents. “Having a liquor store in the same complex will affect our business,” said some of the traders. Chamaraja MLA Nagendra asked authorities to initiate action to shift the liquor outlet to another location at the earliest. “The excise portfolio is handled by chief minister HD Kumaraswamy . He should cancel the wine shop’s licence immediately. If the government does not initiate action, we will hold a massive demonstration in front of the deputy commissioner’s office,” said the BJP leader. In-charge deputy commissioner of excise department in Mysuru Manjunath said that the liquor outlet at the complex in Lakshmikantha Nagar had started operations only after obtaining permission from all the departments. “Owing to opposition from residents and the local MLA, the owner of the outlet has agreed to voluntarily down the shutters of the shop. Necessary measures will be taken to shift the shop to a new location,” Manjunath said. ",30 Apr 2019,2019-04-30 03:52:37

In January, the state government had started 2,381 LKG and UKG classes in anganwadi centres inside government school campuses. The move was made to increase enrollment of students in government elementary schools and at the same time offer an alternative to private schools. The department said it would train teachers of classes 1 to 5 to teach kindergarten instead. “There are hundreds of candidates who are trained in montessori courses waiting to be recruited. For teachers handling classes 1 to 5, it will only be a demotion,” said PK Ilamaran from Tamil Nadu Government Teachers Association. “Nobody can learn to handle children in elementary classes in a month’s time and this will only affect the children,” he said. However, officials said that only surplus teachers in schools have been roped in to teach kindergarten and that they have received a detailed list from all principals. The anganwadi workers have also raised concerns about their role, once the teachers are recruited. Workers claim that there is no mention of duties to be performed by the anganwadi workers and that their role would be reduced to assisting teachers, even though most have decades of experience teaching children in the centres. “We are worried that our jobs will be reduced to inspecting mid-day meals,” asked Vasugi Arul, president of the Tamil Nadu Anganwadi Workers Union. “Instead of sidelining us, the authorities must choose eligible, qualified candidates and provide them the required training. Right now there is a lot of confusion,” she said. ",29 Apr 2019,2019-04-29 06:25:20

Thousands take to Hong Kong streets to protest new extradition laws,Thousands take to Hong Kong streets to protest new extradition laws,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/thousands-take-to-hong-kong-streets-to-protest-new-extradition-laws/articleshow/69081741.cms,en,"HONG KONG: Thousands of people marched on Hong Kong's parliament on Sunday to demand the scrapping of proposed extradition rules that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial - a move which some fear puts the city's core freedoms at risk. Opponents of the proposal fear further erosion of rights and legal protections in the free-wheeling financial hub - freedoms which were guaranteed under the city's handover from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Early estimates suggested several thousand people had joined the march along Hong Kong Island from Causeway Bay to the council in the Admiralty business district. Veteran Hong Kong activist and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung said the government's move risked removing Hong Kongers' ""freedom from fear"". ""Hong Kong people and visitors passing by Hong Kong will lose their right not to be extradited into mainland China,"" he said. ""They would need to face an unjust legal system on the mainland."" Some younger marchers said they were worried about travelling to China after the move, which comes just as the government encourages young people to deepen ties with the mainland and promotes Hong Kong's links with southern China. The peaceful marchers chanted demands for Hong Kong's Executive Carrie Lam to step down, saying she had ""betrayed"" Hong Kong. Some sported yellow umbrellas - the symbol of the Occupy civil disobedience movement that paralysed parts of Hong Kong for 11 weeks in 2014. The proposed changes have sparked an unusually broad chorus of concern from international business elites to lawyers and rights' groups and even some pro-establishment figures. Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong who handed the city back to Chinese rule in 1997, on Saturday described the move ""as an assault on Hong Kong's values, stability and security"", government-funded broadcaster RTHK reported. Chief Executive Lam and other government officials are standing fast by their proposals, saying they are vital to plug long-standing loopholes. Under the changes, the Hong Kong leader would have the right to order the extradition of wanted offenders to China, Macau and Taiwan as well as other countries not covered by Hong Kong's existing extradition treaties. As a safeguard such orders, to be issued case-by-case, could be challenged and appealed through the city's vaunted legal system. Government officials have said no-one at risk of the death penalty or torture or facing a political charge could be sent from Hong Kong. Under pressure from local business groups, they earlier exempted nine commercial crimes from the new provisions. The proposals could be passed into law later in the year, with the city's pro-democratic camp no longer holding enough seats to block the move. The government has justified the swift introduction of the changes by saying they are needed so a young Hong Kong man suspected of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan can be extradited to face charges there. The government's assurances are not enough for Lam Wing-kee, a former Hong Kong political bookseller who said in 2016 he was abducted by mainland agents in the city. Lam left Hong Kong for Taiwan last week, saying he feared being sent back to the mainland under the new laws and his experienced showed he could have no trust in China's legal system. A group of 33 followers of Falun Gong, a religious sect banned in China, flew from Taiwan to Hong Kong on Saturday to join the march but were refused entry to Hong Kong, RTHK reported. Sunday's march comes amid renewed calls for deeper electoral reforms stalled five years ago after Occupy protests. Four leaders of the movement were last week sentenced to jail terms ranging from eight to 16 months, part of a group of nine activists found guilty after a near month-long trial.

The next day, IMD issued a rain alert for three more days, but denizens who set out to work, carrying umbrellas and raincoats, ended up complaining of sweltering heat and humidity. So, are the agencies assigned with the task of tracking weather getting it wrong? Not really, say several leading climate change experts of the country, as predicting weather, which has always been a big challenge, has now become even more difficult. Under the influence of global warming, unusually high temperature at 35.5°C, during mid-February, coupled with rising pollution, generated a lot of moisture in the air, which was released in the form of rain and hailstorms for the past one week. “The weather phenomena are unusual, because suddenly troughs are developing from March 31, due to big increase in temperature and subsequent formation of moisture,” said RV Subba Rao, retired meteorologist, and expert in analysing weather charts. With thunderstorm activity generally starting in the second half of April, denizens in Hyderabad and thousands of farmers were taken aback as hailstorms and heavy rains destroyed 55,000 acres of land, yielding mango and several horticulture crops in Nizamabad, Khammam, Peddapalle, Mancherial, Siddipet, Jagtial and Rajanna-Sircilla districts. Now with a heatwave warning issued for the next two days and a cyclonic storm brewing in the Bay of Bengal, more devastation is on the cards, experts said. Needed better agriculture policy Climate change experts say that the shifting of monsoon is impacting local weather, and local governments must brace for more bad weather. “We have to get ready for some losses and damages. First let us protect people, secondly, it’s important to adapt and change. These days, some farmers are not leaving mangoes in the open. They are covering them with polythene, so that it doesn’t get affected by hail or rain. That’s adaptability, but it’s expensive,” said Sanjay Vashist, expert at Climate Action Network (CAN). Agriculture experts say if farmers don’t get adequate compensation or minimum support price for crop loss, there could be more protests. “Farm agitation will grow in India, as they don’t know what’s hitting them. So, they want minimum support price,” added Vashist. Skymet predicted isolated rains over Telangana this month, but do not expect the weather activity to recur for few more days. Weather experts say rain could be back from May 1 and could have another round of disastrous impact before monsoon. Skymet has doppler radars in Hyderabad and lightning detectors, but they confess that pinpointing exact weather system under the current scenario and sending an alert in advance is difficult. “With time so less in our hands, the administration is not able to take precautionary measures,” chief Skymet meteorologist, Mahesh Palawat, told TOI from Delhi. “While climate and weather pattern are changing, farmers are doing traditional farming. They are not being educated about the new variety of seeds that are weather resilient and climate resilient. The chemicals and pesticides that are banned by government, are still being used,” added Palawat. ",28 Apr 2019,2019-04-28 03:32:31

The family members alleged that doctors, who initially said that Sukhdeep’s condition was stable, asked them to shift her to Chandigarh only when the patient’s condition got deteriorated. By the time they reached the hospital Sukhdeep was already dead and her body was lying in a car. They said the doctors did not even informed them about the death. The family members have demanded an independent probe against the doctors.

Sanatan Dharam Sabha (SDS), a local religious group, had called for a peaceful march from its headquarters at Char Chinar to the deputy commissioner's office in the communally sensitive town to lodge their protest against the killings and alleged failure of police to nab the culprits. RSS leader Chandarkant Sharma and his security guard were killed by a terrorist inside the district hospital on April 9, while state secretary of BJP Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet Parihar were killed in the town on November 1 last year. Raising slogans against the killings, hundreds of people, including women, marched in a procession in the town under police protection, the officials said. On reaching the DC office complex, however, some of the protesters turned violent and set ablaze the effigy of the governor and damaged several official vehicles, they said. They said the mob also broke open the main gate of the multi-storied building and ransacked several rooms, damaging some records. The protesters also tried to force their way into the office of deputy commissioner Angrez Singh Rana but were chased out of the building by policemen without using any force, the officials said. Later, they said the protesters dispersed on their own before the arrival of the reinforcements. Rana said police were directed to exercise restraint to avoid any civilian casualty. ""We have taken a serious note of the hooliganism and appropriate action is being taken against the persons involved in it,"" he told PTI. The deputy commissioner said an FIR was being registered in connection with the incident.

The walk was organized to check out the destruction of trees in the 17 acre land - which contain an estimated 3,000 trees of different varieties - that has been handed over by the state government to Kochi Metro for the construction of a Metro village. “We will meet on May 15 and organize another tree walk to raise awareness. A three-member panel of experts, including ecologist Anita Sharma, former DFO N C Induchoodan and botanist C M Joy will draw up an ecological estimate caused by the destruction of the trees in the area for concrete construction,” said social and environment activist C R Neelankandan. The walkers found waste being dumped all over the place. The activists are planning to submit an ecological damage assessment to the different agencies. “We identified around 25 species in the approachable area. There must be even more. Since a thorn fence has been put up, we couldn’t venture further. We were wondering how such a greenery can be removed off in the name of development,” said ecologist Anita Sharma. She said that when a city is being developed as a Smart city, it is important to have green and open spaces. “This is important for our health which is at stake due to pollution. One index of city development is its greenery. Though right now it is being said in name only.” Former forest official N C Induchoodan said that the only greenery in Thrikkakara municipality in a public space is here in this 17 acres and the destruction of this would be a disaster.

To save the long-standing trees, the citizens’ campaign is turning over a new leaf by inviting objections from various organizations. Since about five months, the residents of Bharat Nagar and green activists have been agitating against a proposed road, which threatens to kill age-old trees and a biodiversity habitat at the mini-forest Bharat Van, presently owned by Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV). To change the decision of policymakers, the spearheaders of the campaign are seeking objection letters from organizations, which they plan to submit to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, Union minister Nitin Gadkari and state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “The proposed road passing through the green area will cost us around 200 fully-grown trees and almost 500 small trees ageing around 10-12 years. Taking into account the loss to the environment, it is highly recommended that existing adjacent roads should be widened after requisite modification in the development plan,” stated the letter filed by Nagpur Residential Hotels Association. Another letter by NGO Green Vigil Foundation states that cutting hundreds of age-old trees will be a big loss to the city. “Alternate road via Ravi Nagar exists and the need of this proposed road itself is debatable,” it adds. Not just from Nagpur organizations from all across the region have extended support to the campaign. Satpuda Foundation, which works for forest and tiger conservation in Central India, submitted an objection letter stating, “The virgin forest patch near Bharat Nagar is one of the last few green patches left in Nagpur. This green cover actually helps reduce the atmospheric carbon and to fight the climate change. The proposed road by cutting large number of natural old trees is unnecessary, avoidable and against the concept of smart city adopted by the government.” Amravati-based Center for Animal Rescue and Study wrote, “We have studied the area and the road is unnecessary. We request the authorities to rethink their strategy on such unsustainable development.” On May 1, a human chain aiming to be the state’s longest one is being organized at Futala at 7.30am. To gather public participation for the event, a missed call campaign has been organized by the agitators. “We are getting a positive response. Till date, we have received hundreds of missed calls,” they said. Recently, actor-producer Dia Mirza, who is also the United Nations Environment Goodwill Ambassador for India, came forward to support the campaign. ",27 Apr 2019,2019-04-27 00:00:00

The Deccan Gymkhana police have registered an offence under sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the IPC on the basis of a complaint lodged by Chaitanya Bajoria of Kothrud on Thursday. Bajoria is a second year engineering student of a private engineering college in Kothrud. On Wednesday night, Bajoria and his friend were on their way on a bike to the Deccan area to have an ice-cream. While they were on the SNDT Road, they spotted the biker approaching from the Athawale Chowk. “This stretch is prohibited for vehicular entry. Bajoria alerted the biker about the rule,” Deccan Gymkhana police senior inspector Deepak Lagad said. “Instead of stopping, the biker abused Bajoria and his friend and rode towards Karve Road. Bajoria and his friend went ahead, took a right turn from the Athawale Chowk on Law College Road and started plying via Karve Road,” a Deccan Gymkhana police officer said. “By the time they reached near a petrol pump on the road, the biker intercepted them. He forced Bajoria to get down from the bike and started abusing him. After forcing Bajoria to get on to his bike, the suspect started speeding towards one of the by-lanes off Karve Road. He stopped on a by-lane, beat up Bajoria and fled,” the officer said. Bajoria sustained minor injuries. “We have got the registration number of the suspect’s bike and will soon arrest him,” Lagad said. This is not the first instance of wrong-side motorists assaulting people objecting to such road rule violations. In December 2018, the Hadapsar police had arrested a cab driver for attacking a traffic policeman and misbehaving with a woman constable after he was caught for wrong-side driving between Sasanenagar and Kalepadal. The month before, a woman professor was arrested for attacking a traffic constable following a dispute over wrong side driving at the Magarpatta junction. ",27 Apr 2019,2019-04-27 00:00:00

Reacting to reports that police protection has been accorded to help GAIL lay its pipeline for 29 km distance in Naangur region in Sirkazhi taluk of Nagapattinam district , Dhinakaran said the prevailing sentiment in the delta districts is to make it a ‘protected agricultural zone’. “Projects should be for people and people should not be made to suffer for the sake of corporate projects. There is no reason to bring such projects and destroy the lives of people in the delta districts, where agriculture is the lifeline,” Dhinakaran said. “Knowing this pretty well, Amma ( Jayalalithaa ) did not allow such projects to come in. However, the present state government, which calls itself as Amma’s government, does not care for the welfare of the people,” Dhinakaran said. “Both the Centre and the state government should immediately put a stop to such projects. If they don’t do that, the people will teach them the right lesson,” he added. ",26 Apr 2019,2019-04-26 00:00:00

Doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered accountants, post graduate students of medical colleges and women folks from the open category voluntarily took part in the Dandi stir as the organizers, Anti-excess reservation Ekta Manch, called it. The protesters walked to the collectorate from Nehru Maidan wearing Gandhi caps and displaying banners and placards with slogans ‘Save merit, save nation’ and ‘Murder of merit’. A memorandum, demanding cancellation of ‘excess’ reservation in the state, was submitted to Collector Shailesh Naval. Coordinator of the rally, Dr. Shrigopal Rathi told TOI,” We are not against Constitutional reservation. We are against excess reservation granted to various sections of the society in the state. This decision is depriving merit students from getting admissions to various courses.” Adv. Brajesh Tiwari called for cancellation of excess reservation. “It will effect a forced brain drain as merit students will migrate to other countries for education and jobs as well.” Dr. Atul Alsi said that excess reservation has left only 4% to 5% seats for the open category. “The constitution of India had granted reservations for the first ten years only, but successive governments persisted with them for political gains. Though the Supreme Court has called for limiting reservation to 50%, the Central and state governments have extended it to 78% and with the earmarking system, it has gone up to almost 95%, leaving hardly any room for merit students from the open category. Is it not absurd that there are only 5% seats for the open category whereas there are 95% seats for the reserved category.” In the memorandum submitted to the Collector, the march listed eight demands. Besides cancellation of excess reservation and earmarking system, the other demands included conditional reservation, only one time reservation in education/employment, no reservation in PG courses and in promotions, confining reservation to government schools and colleges only and reservations purely on economic norms and not on the basis of caste.

While addressing reporters here on Thursday, Tamil Desiya Periyakkam leader P Maniarasan said that the BJP-led central government has been discriminating against Tamil people in many ways, which include providing employment opportunities to the youths in the state. The Union government had been neglecting the youths in providing jobs in the 18 public sector undertakings in the state.

A division bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Nitin Jamdar closed a suo motu public interest litigation initiated last year following milk protests organised by Swabhiman Shetkari Sanghatana. “The right to dissent and protest will include the right to throw milk belonging to an individual by the individual himself or an association if the act is to draw attention of the public to the producer’s plight,” said the judges. The PIL was filed after a former judge wrote a letter drawing the court’s attention to the protest and wastage of milk. “The letter does not state that the Sanghatana destroyed the milk despite producers of the milk not agreeing (to it),” observed the bench, adding that the “right to protest and lodge one’s dissent in a democratic society” could not be throttled. In July 2018, dairy farmers led by the Sanghatana had launched a protest seeking a hike in milk procurement prices. The farmers were protesting as they were being paid Rs16-20 for a litre of cow milk. At many places, protesters had blocked milk tankers and emptied contents on the road or distributed milk packets free to the public. The four-day blockade was called off after the state agreed to hike the price paid to milk suppliers to Rs25 per litre. The letter had sought action against the Sanghatana for destroying milk to be sold in the open market. Additional government pleader Abhay Patki told the court that a loss was caused as the milk was wasted. The bench said that it was a form of protest. “There may be merit in the point that destruction of a food product is not desirable, but this should be left to the decision of the owner of the food product,” said the judges.

Locals expressed their satisfaction, but wondered if the same action would be witnessed in the coming days. “It was a good beginning, but this needs to be sustained. The evenings are equally crazy, but the cop presence goes down,” said Kalyan Sen, a local resident. TOI visited the spot in the evening and found sergeants moving in from 5pm, well before the senior school got over. The instructions were clear — no parking that can block the road will be allowed. The police said they were implementing one step at a time in order to reach the “middle path”. “There are thousands of students who study here. We cannot take any hasty decisio. The idea today was to stop illegal parking. We have clamped around half a dozen cars on Wednesday. We put in more men on the road at almost each crossing in and around South Point High School. However, no change of traffic movement has been proposed as yet,” said an officer. The cops said that with two political rallies in the vicinity, there was pressure on both Syed Amir Ali Avenue and Gariahat Road on Wednesday. “However, we went ahead with the enforcement. We acted against only those who had abandoned their vehicles for a long time,” said an officer. Swinhoe Street, too, was two-way all through the day. Not all the students, though, agreed with the “hurried” way in which the rules were implemented. “There are many pool cars waiting for students. When we came to our designated spot, we did not find our car. We had board the vehicle from Bosco Residency after walking some distance in thick traffic. The vehicle was in the middle of the road and we had to jump in. No cop helped us while we were boarding,” said a student, Sutanuka Lahiri. An officer of the Southeast traffic guard said, “The only other solution other than stopping illegal parking is to ask students to walk or have buses pick up and drop off students on a rotational basis. This is one decision that we cannot take since it can have serious repercussions on traffic.” ",25 Apr 2019,2019-04-25 00:00:00

Students of third year BCom had protested at the VNSGU campus couple of weeks ago alleging serious errors in the management accountancy question paper of the sixth semester students. The students claimed that due to multiple errors many students were set to lose marks. Following the agitations VNSGU accepted errors in the question paper and offered relaxation. The university acknowledged that some questions had wrong figures. They also found that some questions were out of the syllabus, while a few were lengthy ones that could never be answered in limited time. University in an informal letter informed students that those who attempted those questions will be given full marks and some other relaxations were also announced. But the students are demanding that they be given more relaxations arguing that those who could not understand the erroneous questions, might have not attempted it at all.

Four Hong Kong 'Occupy' leaders jailed for 2014 democracy protests,Four Hong Kong 'Occupy' leaders jailed for 2014 democracy protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/four-hong-kong-occupy-leaders-jailed-for-2014-democracy-protests/articleshow/69027993.cms,en,"HONG KONG: A Hong Kong court jailed four leaders of 2014 pro-democracy protests on Wednesday amid heightened concerns over the decline of freedoms in the China-ruled city nearly five years after activists took to the streets in mass protests. The sentencing of the nine activists followed a near month-long trial that was closely watched as China’s Communist Party leaders have put Hong Kong’s autonomy under increasing strain, stoking concern among foreign governments, rights groups and business people. Law professor Benny Tai, 54, and retired sociologist Chan Kin-man, 60, were both jailed for 16 months for conspiracy to commit public nuisance tied to the protests that paralyzed parts of the Asian financial center for 79 days in late 2014 and became known as the Umbrella Movement. Their sentence had been reduced by two months given their clean criminal record and positive character, Justice Johnny Chan said. Pro-democracy lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun and activist Raphael Wong were both jailed for eight months for inciting public nuisance. “We maintain our determination to achieve universal suffrage ... this won’t change,” Wong shouted out in court as he was taken away. Since the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997, critics say Beijing has reneged on a commitment to maintain Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and freedoms under a “one country, two systems” arrangement. The protesters had demanded that China's Communist Party leaders allow genuine universal suffrage in Hong Kong to select its leader. Police cleared the demonstrators in December 2014, and authorities granted no democratic concessions. Chan, in passing sentence, acknowledged the right to civil disobedience and the right of assembly and free speech, but said the protracted road blockages had caused suffering to the public and that some restrictions on freedoms were necessary in a democratic society. Retired pastor Chu Yiu-ming, 75, received a suspended sentence, as did veteran democrat Lee Wing-tat and former student leader Eason Chung, with the judge taking into account their ages, public service and clean records. Another former student leader, Tommy Cheung, was ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service. Tanya Chan, a democratic lawmaker, 47, had her sentencing postponed until June 10, following the discovery of a life-threatening brain tumor that required an operation, she said. Several hundred supporters, many wearing yellow ribbons and holding yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the protests, gathered outside the West Kowloon Law Courts, and later at an evening vigil, demanding the four men be freed. “I’m sad I can’t be in jail with them. It’s their bright moment to enshrine their love of democracy,” said Chu, as the crowds around him cheered and cupped candles in their hands. The trial was considered the most significant legal maneuver by authorities to punish those involved in the 2014 protests, called Occupy Central, in reference to the city’s central business district . The demonstrations were Hong Kong’s biggest and most protracted in recent decades and one of the boldest challenges to China’s leaders since pro-democracy protests in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. Organizers estimated that more than one million people took part in the protests over nearly three months. All the leaders had argued the protests were intended as peaceful, non-violent civil disobedience, only to benefit society and make positive democratic progress. Justice Chan said their “martyrdom ... was a concocted one”, noting that the price the defendants were prepared to pay had also to be borne by an inconvenienced public. ERODING FREEDOMS Authorities have clamped down on opposition forces, disqualified democratic legislators, jailed activists and banned a pro-independence political party. After the sentences, the five freed defendants urged the public to turn out en masse on Sunday for a protest to show solidarity with those jailed and to oppose proposed extradition laws that would allow people to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial. Critics fear the laws, which are expected to be passed this year, could further erode legal protections so vital to the capitalist hub, and undermine the city’s international reputation. A representative for the British consulate in Hong Kong said it would be “deeply concerning if the outcome for these individuals (the Occupy leaders) were to deter the people of Hong Kong from participating in peaceful protest in the future.” The U.S. consulate said in a statement it was concerned by the Hong Kong government’s decision to bring the charges against organizers of the “peaceful protests in 2014”. “Such prosecutions can stifle the exercise of the basic freedoms enshrined in the Basic Law,” said a U.S. consular spokesman, referring to the city’s mini constitution. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that it “deeply regretted” the court’s decision, which it said showed the failure of “one country, two systems” to protect political rights.

Hong Kong democracy leaders jailed over Umbrella Movement protests,Hong Kong democracy leaders jailed over Umbrella Movement protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hong-kong-democracy-leaders-jailed-over-umbrella-movement-protests/articleshow/69023232.cms,en,"HONG KONG: Four prominent leaders of Hong Kong's democracy movement were jailed on Wednesday for their role in organising mass protests in 2014 that paralysed the city for months and infuriated Beijing. The prison terms are the latest hammer blow to the city's beleaguered democracy movement which has seen key figures jailed or banned from standing as legislators since their demonstrations shook the city but failed to win any concessions. Nine activists were all convicted earlier in April of at least one charge in a prosecution that deployed rarely used colonial-era public nuisance laws over their participation in the Umbrella Movement protests, which called for free elections to appoint the city's leader. Their trial renewed alarm over shrinking freedoms under an assertive China which has rejected demands by Hong Kongers for a greater say in how the financial hub is run. Two key leaders of the mass protests — sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 60, and law professor Benny Tai, 54 — received the longest sentences of 16 months in jail, sparking tears in court and angry chants from hundreds of supporters gathered outside. Two other leaders — activist Raphael Wong and lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun — received eight months while the rest either had their jail terms suspended or were given a community service order. One defendant, lawmaker Tanya Chan, had her sentencing adjourned because she needs surgery for a brain tumour. The jail terms are the steepest yet for anyone involved in the 79-day protest which vividly illustrated the huge anger — particularly among Hong Kong's youth — over the city's leadership and direction. As Wong was led away by guards he proclaimed: ""Our determination to fight for democracy will not change."" Tai and Chan founded a civil disobedience campaign known as ""Occupy Central"" in 2013 alongside 75-year-old Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming, one of the defendants to have his jail term suspended. Their original idea of taking to the streets to demand a fairer system and the right to directly elect Hong Kong's leader was a precursor to the student-led Umbrella Movement a year later that brought parts of the city to a standstill. Authorities in Hong Kong and the mainland have defended the prosecutions as a necessary measure to punish the leaders of a direct action movement that took over key intersections of the city for many weeks. But activists and rights groups have argued that the use of the vaguely worded public nuisance laws — and wielding the steeper common law punishment — is an insidious blow to free speech and a new tactic from prosecutors. ""The long sentences sends a chilling warning to all that there will be serious consequences for advocating for democracy,"" said Maya Wang, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on China. But city leader Carrie Lam remained unmoved by such criticisms. Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether the jailings would damage Hong Kong's free speech reputation, she replied: ""I can't see any impact."" There were emotional scenes outside the courthouse with the defendants met by a noisy crowd of supporters shouting ""Add Oil!"", a popular Cantonese phrase to signal encouragement. Others sang ""We Shall Overcome"", the gospel song that became an anthem of the civil rights movement in the United States. Speaking after the sentencing, Tanya Chan told the crowds: ""I hope Hong Kongers will not lose hope, will not be afraid, will not have regrets or back down now"". Many supporters were holding umbrellas, an emblem of the 2014 protests after they were used by young demonstrators to defend themselves against police batons, tear gas canisters and pepper spray. Joseph Lo, 59, was wearing a yellow T-shirt with the phrase ""I was not incited"" — a reference to the charges laid against the protest leaders. ""We were not incited by these nine people,"" he told AFP, adding he hit the streets in 2014 because of the refusal to grant Hong Kongers universal suffrage and the police's decision to fire tear gas at protesters. While the financial hub enjoys rights unseen on the Chinese mainland under a 50-year handover agreement between Britain and China, there are fears those liberties are being eroded as Beijing flexes its muscles and stamps down on dissent. Hong Kong's leader is elected by a group of just 1,200 largely pro-Beijing appointees, in a city of seven million. Judge Johnny Chan ruled that the 2014 protests were not protected by Hong Kong's free speech laws because the demonstrations impinged on the rights of others. During sentencing, Chan said the defendants had expressed no regret for the ""inconvenience and suffering caused to members of the public"". He added that an apology was ""rightly deserved ... but never received"" from the protest leaders. ",24 Apr 2019,2019-04-24 00:00:00

Sinha, who won Patna Sahib seat twice in 2009 and 2014 as BJP candidate, joined the Congress a few weeks ago after meeting AICC president Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. He was later declared as Congress candidate from Patna Sahib where filing of nomination papers began on Monday. The demonstrators, who were holding placards in their hands, alleged that Shatrughan was “dropped through a parachute” at the RJD’s behest and has been made Congress candidate without consultation from the grassroots workers of the party. They alleged that senior Congress leaders “sold” the Patna Sahib seat to Shatrughan at the behest of RJD chief Lalu Prasad. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Rajesh Rathore said except one of the demonstrators, who is a Congress leader from Chhapra, the others were unknown people. “They were never seen at the Congress office. We believe they were sent by the rival BJP,” Rathore told TOI. He said Shatrughan’s candidature from Patna Sahib has been decided by none other than the Congress high command. “Once the party’s high command takes a decision, no devoted Congress worker goes against it,” he said. Earlier on Sunday, Shatrughan was heckled at the Congress state headquarters while he was addressing a meeting of party workers. The star-turned-politician annoyed a section of Congress workers across the country, including Bihar, when he visited Lucknow a few days ago and campaigned for his wife Poonam Sinha , who is contesting the Lucknow seat on a Samajwadi Party ticket. Shatrughan drew flaks from a section of Congress workers after he described BSP supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav as prime ministerial candidates in Lucknow.

Abhay Sharma (name changed), whose children are studying in fourth and fifth standard of the school, said that the stationery provided by the school costs 30% higher than the market rate. “The school posted about the parent-teacher committee on school website six days back, but we want to ask them why didn’t they write it in the school diary of the students. The school management has accepted our request to hear us out on Saturday. So, we are waiting for a solution to come up by then or else we will take legal action against the school,” said Sharma. Principal of Jayshree Periwal High School Madhu Maini denied the allegations made by the parents. She said that the school has been following all the rules as per law. Similar statement was given by the management of Mahaveer Public School. It said, the fees were increased after taking consent of the parents in the committee formed. Jaipur district education officer Ram Chandra Pilaniya said that the team of three officers of principal cadre has been formed that will look into the matter and submit the report to the state government. “The Rajasthan School Fee Act, 2016, has been stayed by the Rajasthan High Court until further decision. That is why there are currently no regulations guiding the fees structure. We have formed the committee that will investigate the matter and submit the report to the government. After that it will be the prerogative of the government,” said Pilaniya. ",23 Apr 2019,2019-04-23 00:00:00
Parents protest outside two schools seeking rollback,Parents protest outside two schools seeking rollback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/parents-protest-outside-2-schools-seeking-rollback/articleshow/68998480.cms,en,"NEW DELHI: The protests over fee hike in private schools continue. On Monday, parents gathered outside two schools in south and northwest Delhi demanding that the fee hike be rolled back. According to the lists uploaded on the directorate of education (DoE) website, both schools — Apeejay School , Sheikh Sarai and Darbari Lal DAV Model School , Shalimar Bagh — are built on land allotted by government agencies. “We know that this school is built on government land, so how can they increase the fee? The school has been citing some clauses in the allotment letter and claiming they do not have to seek prior approval,” said a parent outside Apeejay School. The parents protested at the school holding placards with slogans such as ‘Stop Extortion, Start Education’, ‘Don’t commercialise education’ and ‘Few Teachers, Big Arrears’. AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj met the protesting parents. The principal, Ritu Mehta, said she would talk about the issue on Tuesday. At Shalimar Bagh, the parents’ association held banners with slogans such as ‘Roll back fee hike’, ‘Treat like a temple, not business’ and even went to meet the DoE director. The Delhi parents’ association also joined the protest. According to the protesters, the school is charging fees under heads like safety and security, and login ID. “We were told by the DoE director that a notice has already been sent to the school that they cannot increase the fees nor demand arrears from parents,” said Aprajita Gautam of the Delhi parents’ association. “During audit, it was found that the school has excess funds. We have asked the director to issue a show-cause notice and, in case of non-compliance, to de-recognise the school,” she added. The school principal did not respond to calls and messages. With the schools built on private land also increasing the fees and parents being forced to pay, the parents’ association requested the director to restrain them as well.

Silent protest to save sacred grove in Kerala,Silent protest to save sacred grove in Kerala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/silent-protest-to-save-sacred-grove/articleshow/68982670.cms,en,"KOCHI: A group of green activists has decided to exercise NOTA (none of the above) option in the Lok Sabha polls in Kerala as a mark of silent protest to save Shantivanam , a green abode with sacred groves and ponds at North Paravur in Ernakulam. As many as 55 signatories, including National Alliance for People’s movement (NAPM) and noted environmentalists like former chairman of Kerala state biodiversity board V S VIjayan, will participate in the silent protest to save the man-made forest on Monday. Several research organizations like Kerala Forest Research Institute and society for environment education in Kerala in their reports had outlined the significance of these sacred groves. “We have decided to go for NOTA option. We will observe a silent protest at Shantivanam on Monday,” said NAPM state coordinator Kusumam Joseph. The greens said that the initiative to opt for NOTA began two days ago primarily against the Kerala state electricity board (KSEB) decision to align a 110kV line with construction of huge towers through the two-acre sacred grove and manmade forest at North Paravur. “The area is home to hundreds of birds, snakes and other animals,” said former head of state disaster management centre K G Thara, one of the signatories to NOTA option. “It is also a source of groundwater and offers fresh oxygenated air to the otherwise polluted surroundings. It is alleged that there is an alternative alignment but KSEB is not interested as it passes through the plot of a former KSEB chairman,’’ she said. ",22 Apr 2019,2019-04-22 00:00:00

The agitation was led by over 20 senior citizens who face the maximum problems while leaving and entering their homes around South Point High School . The cops, however, assured them that a critical “no-entry” board has been withdrawn from Swinhoe Street and the police would help them gain access to their homes from now on. But other demands made by the locals — like asking students to walk down to school from Cornfield Road — were “beyond the cops’ purview”. TimesView This is a vexed problem with no easy solution. But the right to free movement in one’s own neighbourhood is something that every citizen should take for granted. All stakeholders must meet and try to seek solutions with honesty of intent. Residents of Ballygunge Place, Anil Maitra Road, Cornfield Road, Swinhoe Street and Jamir Lane had, on Thursday, vented their ire over the no-entry boards. Nandita Sengupta said it was very difficult to get any sleep from 6.30am because of the noise and smoke from the cars that start to arrive for school. Kalyan Sen, who travels to Howrah for work, said he was fed up with the traffic mess near his home. “We don’t even have access to our homes, a basic right of any citizen,” he said. For the last 30 years, the situation has remained the same. Residents’ complaints range from “denied access to homes” and “ambulances can’t reach the ailing” to “driving in and out of the area during school hours is impossible”. “We have to park our cars two-and-a-half-kilometres aw-ay. App cabs refuse to pick us up from our doorstep. We can’t even take a rickshaw as cops don’t allow them,” said Suchandra Das, a resident of Ballygunge Place. An officer of the southeast traffic guard, which manages traffic in the area, said: “The only solution is to ask students to walk or have buses pick up and drop off students on a rotational basis. The residents have suggested some other solutions too — asking students to walk down from Cornfield Road and banning buses and cars from being parked outside main entrances to houses. The first one is not a decision we can take. As for the second, it can have serious repercussions on traffic. We will help locals collect passes so that we can facilitate their entry through Swinhoe Street.” The cops rejected the locals’ claims that Swinhoe Street had been made either a no-entry zone or one-way. “Contrary to perception, Swinhoe Street has been open for residents since last December,” said an officer. “Yes, it is a problem. The school has been here for the last 50 years. A number of high-rises have come up and population in the locality has increased exponentially. But the traffic problem is something which only cops can resolve. We do whatever police advise us. Time and again, we circulate advisories to students. We also help cops come up with tenable solution to problems,” a spokesperson of South Point School had earlier informed TOI. ",23 Apr 2019,2019-04-23 00:00:00
DoE nixes fee-hike plea of 170 schools,DoE nixes fee-hike plea of 170 schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/doe-nixes-fee-hike-plea-of-170-schools/articleshow/68998449.cms,en,"NEW DELHI: The directorate of education ( DoE ) rejected the proposals of 170 private schools of the 266 that had applied for increasing fees as they were found in possession of excess funds, official data has revealed. There were 30 private schools that withdrew the proposal on their own, suggesting that they didn’t require a fee hike . Schools built on government land (allotted by Delhi Development Authority) have to seek prior approval from DoE before increasing fees. In total, there are 301 schools built on DDA land . DoE said the proposals were rejected after calculating the financial implications of the Seventh Pay Commission while conducting audit of the schools. “In total, 170 schools were found in possession of excess funds, so they have not been granted permission to hike fees. While making these calculations, the financial implications of the VII CPC have been taken into consideration. Therefore, these schools shouldn’t deny benefits of the pay commission to their staff,” the education department’s document said. Seven schools whose applications were rejected have moved Delhi high court. Their case is yet to be settled. The high court is also hearing another case over fee hike and has granted a stay till April 30. The 30 schools who withdrew their proposal cannot hike fees nor deny benefits of the Seventh Pay Commission to their staff. Schools given permission have to keep the fee hike restricted to the limit set by DoE. Action will be taken on schools not complying with DoE’s directions. The schools that didn’t submit a proposal have no provision to increase their fees, the DoE document added. School principals, however, highlight that such “overregulation” by the government is causing a lot of problems. Sadhna Bhalla, chairperson of National Progressive Schools Conference (NPSC), a consortium of 200 schools, said, “Everybody is feeling oppressed. The autonomy of private schools has to be kept intact. We have to pay high salaries, but fees have been capped at a very low rate. We are open to scrutiny, but the government has to develop an efficient system. After the scrutiny there is delay in action. We have to submit a request to find out about our proposals, which causes a lot of problems.” In Bhalla’s Mira Model School, fees have not been increased for the past six years. While there is a rule in place for schools built on DDA land, confusion prevails over those constructed on land given by other government agencies. There are 448 private schools built on land given by other government agencies. Many such schools have increased the fees and have been asking parents to pay the dues along with arrears.

Sinha who won Patna Sahib seat twice in 2009 and 2014 as BJP candidate, joined the Congress a few weeks ago in the presence of the AICC president Rahul Gandhi and he has now been declared as Congress candidate from Patna Sahib where nomination began from Monday. The demonstrators, who were holding anti-Sinha placards in their hand, also alleged that Shatru was “dropped through a parachute” at the ally RJD’s behest and has been made Congress candidate without consultation from the grass-root workers. They also alleged that Congress senior leaders “sold” the Patna Sahib seat to Shatru at the behest of RJD chief Lalu Prasad. When contacted, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Rajesh Rathore said except one of the demonstrators who is a Congress leader from Chhapra, all other demonstrators were unknown persons. “They were never seen at the Congress office. We believe they were sent by the rival BJP camp to create a sort of confusion among the electors of Patna Sahib seat,” Rathore told TOI. He said the Sinha’s candidature from Patna Sahib has been decided by none other than the Congress high command. “Once the party’s high command takes a decision about anything, no devoted Congress worker goes against the high command’s decision,” he said. Earlier on Sunday, Sinha, also known as Shotgun, was heckled at the Congress state headquarters while he was addressing a meeting of party workers. The star-turned-politician annoyed a section of Congress workers across the country including Bihar, when he visited Lucknow a few days ago and campaigned for his wife Poonam who is contesting the Lucknow seat as the candidate of the BSP-Samajwadi Party-RLD combine. A section of Congress workers became angry with Sinha after he stated in Lucknow that the BSP supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav as prime ministerial candidates.

While sources claimed that candidates for all seven seats had been finalised, the party did not declare the list till late on Sunday. While Chauhan was in contention from the reserved constituency of North West Delhi, Mishra, a Poorvanchali leader, was seeking ticket from West Delhi. According to sources, the Congress working committee, at a meeting earlier this month, had finalised names of four candidates, including Chauhan. The names, however, were not formally announced. “Chauhan was even informed after the meeting that his name had been finalised and was told to start preparing for the election. The party’s decision to give the ticket to somebody else came as a surprise. That is why hundreds of his supporters reached the Congress headquarters,” said a party leader, requesting anonymity. Sources said caste equations within the community tilted the balance against Chauhan. A source said: “The party leadership got several representations from the ‘Balmiki’ community that it was being overlooked. Chauhan, who belongs to the ‘Khateek’ community, lost out to Congress working president Rajesh Lilothia, a ‘Balmiki’.” Chauhan quelled speculation that he might quit the party. “I abide by the party’s decision. I have always been a Congressman and will remain one. When I came to know about the protests, I immediately called up people who were leading the agitation and asked them to come back,” said Chauhan, who won four consecutive Delhi assembly elections between 1993 and 2008. While Congress was initially keen to field a Poorvanchali in Delhi, it finally seemed to have decided to go for Olympic silver-medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar, a Jat, from West Delhi. “I am trying to pacify my supporters, but they are angry over neglect of Poorvanchalis. West Delhi is dominated by Poorvanchalis and its (not giving ticket to Poorvanchali) impact will be visible in the results of eastern UP and Bihar also,” Mishra said. A three-time MLA from Naseerpur (deleted after delimitation) and Dwarka, Mishra was elected to the Lok Sabha in 2009. Sources said Congress had finalised names of Sheila Dikshit from Chandni Chowk, JP Agarwal from North East Delhi, Ramesh Kumar from South Delhi and Arvinder Singh Lovely from East Delhi Lok Sabha seats.

The protesters had similar grievances — financial irregularities and delay in possession by the builder. On Sunday morning, hundreds of residents of Mahindra Aura in New Palam Vihar staged a protest at the society clubhouse against the “malpractices and financial irregularities” conducted by their RWA. Aura residents said they had brought a no-confidence motion and dissolved the current RWA by calling a special general body meeting on September 16 last year, but the RWA continues to hold financial powers. “The RWA office bearers have, in collusion with the district registrar office, carried out several illegal activities, including replacement of security agency at a higher cost, increasing maintenance charges and installing poorly-planned CCTV cameras at a cost five times greater than the market rate,” said Tej Malik, a protester. Mahindra Aura RWA president Yashish Yadav said the matter is in court. “A group of residents are harassing RWA office bearers,” he said. Meanwhile, around 200 buyers of Greenopolis housing project in Sector 89 protested at the New Delhi residences of the directors of developer Orris Infrastructure, Vijay Gupta and Nirmal Singh.

Senior officials said the government has set a target of purchasing 40 lakh metric tonnes (MTs) of paddy from farmers. The civil supplies department has already procured 2.97 lakh MTs of paddy from 27,591 farmers and shifted 2.58 lakh MTs to rice mills. Civil supplies commissioner Akun Sabharwal, who held a teleconference with officials here on Monday, said every step is being taken as per the instruction of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to ensure that farmers do not suffer.

A control room has also been set up at the civil supplies commissioner’s office to monitor the situation on a daily basis. Farmers can register complaints and suggestions on toll-free number 1800-425-00333 or WhatsApp number 7330774444. Sabharwal, who also visited paddy procurement centres (PPCs) in Nalgonda and Suryapet districts, promised that wet paddy would be bought from farmers. He also interacted with farmers and reviewed paddy procurement, transportation and condition of PPCs. Lorries would be available to transport paddy from paddy procurement centres to rice mills. The government said over 3,600 PPCs have been set up. “In case of emergency, officials will inform district joint collectors and head office immediately,” he said. The civil supplies department has also started taking measures and directed officials to keep tarpaulin sheets in sufficient quantity and numbers at PPCs and shift paddy to rice mills immediately after purchase.

Netizens have launched a campaign seeking justice for the girl. The 21-year-old deceased girl was a sixth-semester civil engineering student at Navodaya Institute of Technology in Raichur. Her name has been withheld on request from parents. According to police, the girl left home on April 13 ostensibly to write internal exams — and never returned. Her body was found in a decomposed state in a forested area near Manikaprabhu Hill, Raichur, three days later. A death note found next to the body suggested she had committed suicide over academic failure — a charge dismissed by her parents as ludicrous. Taking note of the spontaneous student protests, the Karnataka government asked the DG&IGP to conduct a probe into the incident and bring the guilty to book. Students seek impartial probe into girl’s death Student organisations and classmates of the girl took out a rally and torchlight parade in Raichur seeking an impartial probe into her death. Some Kannada film actors have lent their voice to the protests. Police sources said the girl’s parents insisted — with corroboration — that it was a case of unnatural death and, possibly, murder. After two days, the girl’s parents suspected the role of Sudarshan Yadav, her collegemate in PU. Based on their complaint, police arrested him and remanded him in judicial custody. Police said the boy and girl may have been in a relationship, grounding their theory on texts recovered from their phones. Her parents rejected the version. Since the body was recovered from a forested area, an attack by animals is not ruled out. However, the body appeared to have been partially burnt and it was found hanging from a tree branch with her feet touching the ground. This has raised suspicions that the girl may have been murdered and then her body was hanged from the tree. Home minister MB Patil tweeted: “...

Pandole is contesting as an Independent candidate from Bhopal and Varanasi. With his bicycle adorned with giant hand-written slogans on cardboard placards and a black flag to protest against expensive elections, he spoke to TOI on Friday, explaining his agenda and motto for contesting the elections. “I went to New Delhi with my letter, but did not get any response from the EC. It was then that I decided to file my nomination and contest the polls to raise the voice of common men,” said Pandole. He maintained that parties spend money of the public to campaign for elections and then use corrupt means to earn back the money, he said. “If this continues, no party will work for public welfare. All of them are busy filling their own pockets. If the EC puts a strict check on over-expenditure during poll campaign, the public’s hard earned money will be saved,” Pandole added. Filing nomination from two cities -- Bhopal and Varanasi -- Pandole is all set to campaign for himself on his bicycle, decorated with placards that read ‘Loktantra ka dushman, kharcheela chunav’ ( democracy 's enemy, expensive polls). “I will file the nomination from Bhopal on Saturday and then head to Varanasi with my bicycle loaded in a train. I will file the nomination in Varanasi by April 24 and contest the elections without spending a single penny. I will ride across the two cities on my cycle and address people at tea stalls and bus stands,” he explained. Pandole further said that instead of turning the country into a concrete jungle in the name of development, political parties should understand that forests are essential for the country's well-being and the government should create jobs for the protection of forests.

""The people want the release of the detainees"" demonstrators shouted as they marched behind a banner supporting activists linked to the Hirak movement. Earlier this month a court upheld the ruling against 42 people linked to the Al-Hirak al-Shaabi -- or ""Popular Movement"" -- protests which took hold of the marginalised Rif region in October 2016. The rally, dubbed the ""march of the Moroccan people: stop political injustice"", was organised by detainees' families along with political and rights groups. AFP reporters saw thousands of people in the streets, some clutching photographs of those serving jail terms ranging from one to 20 years. ""We call for an end to political arrests and for the release of all detainees (linked to) social movements and a response to their legitimate demands,"" said activist Boubaker al-Jawhari. The sentences first handed down last June were upheld on April 6 by the Casablanca court of appeal, sparking criticism from rights groups. Moroccan authorities insist the judicial process has followed international standards. Social unrest in the Rif region was sparked by the death of a fisherman and escalated into a wave of protests demanding more development, and against corruption and unemployment. The movement's leader Nasser Zefzafi and three others received prison terms of 20 years for threatening the security of the state. Prison authorities say the activists were moved on April 11 from Casablanca to a facility in northern Morocco to be ""close to their families"". ""They were transferred to the worst prisons in the kingdom"" and ""started a hunger strike ,"" said Ahmed Zefzafi, father of Nasser. Addressing a press conference after the Sunday demonstration, he called on ""decision-makers to find a way out of this crisis"". Prison authorities said Friday the detainees' health was being very closely monitored. Other family members confirmed that their detained relatives are protesting against the conditions they are being held in. Beyond the 20-year sentences, other prison terms confirmed on appeal ranged from one to 15 years. Eleven others were pardoned last year by King Mohammed VI. ",21 Apr 2019,2019-04-21 00:00:00

Thakur is the BJP candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha constituency in Madhya Pradesh. Earlier in the day, scores of NCP activists, led by party leader Jitendra Awhad, gathered at the General Arunkumar Vaidya chowk, and raised slogans condemning Thakur and praising Karkare. Thakur, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case and currently out on bail, had said that Karkare died in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack because she had ""cursed"" him for ""torturing"" her. She apologised Friday after her statement caused a furore. The ATS under Karkare had probed the bomb blast case before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over. Awhad alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""backing"" the statement made by the Hindutva leader. ""Calling Thakur a 'sadhavi' (a female seer) is akin to insulting Sahdus.

Environmentalists and tram-lovers in the city have now planned to stage a dharna to protest against the government’s vision-myopia that is leading to the systematic withdrawal of the city’s first public transport, and Asia’s oldest surviving tram network, at a time when fossil fuel-run vehicles have turned out to be the biggest polluters of the city’s ambient air. “It is a myth that trams cause congestion. Even when the entire fleet had been operational, trams made up 2% of the city’s traffic volume, while private cars constitute 24%. Trams, along with suburban and circular rail, Metro and electric buses, have made 22% of city trips electric or zero emission,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, environment scientist and executive director of Centre for Science and Environment. “The process of annihilation of tram began in the 90s when the World Bank funds for the expansion of tram network stopped coming in. A group of politicians led by the then transport minister Shyamal Chakraborty started describing the tram as an obsolete mode of transport. The process continued with the change of regime and has accelerated in th last couple of years,”said Debasish Bhattacharya, whose initiatives led to the Kolkata-Melbourne Tramjatra. Bhattacharya and Souvik Mukherjee of Calcutta Tram Users Association criticized the government’s plan to run trolley buses on tram-tracks. “It is pointless to forget what you have and introduce another technology which has a dubious track record,” he added.

Unidentified gunmen donning uniforms of paramilitary soldiers Thursday massacred 14 passengers after forcing them to disembark from buses on a highway in the restive Balochistan province. The victims were not initially identified and it was speculated they could be Shia Muslims and ethnic workers from Punjab. But later it emerged that they were security personnel, most of them associated with the Pakistan Navy. According to the letter sent by the Foreign Office (FO) to Iran, at least 14 personnel belonging to the Armed Forces of Pakistan were offloaded from buses on April 18 in Oramra area of Balochistan and killed. The Foreign Office said the ""terrorists"" belonging to Baloch nationalist groups were operating from a border region in Iran and has asked Tehran to take action against them. ""BRAS, which is an alliance of three Baloch terrorist organisations, has claimed responsibility for this terrorist act,"" it said. ""Killing of 14 innocent Pakistanis by terrorist groups based in Iran is a very serious incident that Pakistan protests strongly. Pakistan awaits Iran's response to its request for action against the groups based in Iran, whose locations have been identified by Pakistan a number of times,"" the letter said. It asserted that ""after the incident, the terrorists who arrived from border region returned to that area"". Baloch nationalists are active in the Balochistan province and often target the security forces and people from other provinces, especially Punjab. The recent killing had occurred just ahead of the first-ever visit of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to Iran starting on Sunday. Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif condemned the attack, saying enemies of Pakistan-Iran ties were responsible for it. ""Strongly condemning the recent terrorist attack in Pakistan, just as PM Imran Khan embarks on his first, historic visit to Iran. Terrorists, extremists and their sponsors are terrified by close relations between Muslim states,"" he tweeted. Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, is Pakistan's largest and poorest province, rife with ethnic, sectarian and separatist insurgencies. In the past, minority Shia Muslims and ethnic workers from the Punjab province have been targeted in such attacks. An ISIS suicide attack targeting Hazara Shias in the provincial capital of Quetta last week killed 21 people and injured 60 others. Armed gunmen kidnapped about two dozen passengers from two Karachi-bound coaches from Balochistan's Mastung area in 2015, killing at least 19 of them in the mountainous area of Khad Kocha.

The plant was shut down on Thursday, a day after 38 workers had taken ill in a chemical leak. The villagers have threatened to block the roads to the plant and stage an agitation if the plant continues to function in the area. The condition of two of the workers is critical — both of them are undergoing treatment at KEM hospital in Pune; one is on ventilator support. “The plant officials held a meeting with us on Friday and offered us various sops, but we refused to budge. We have warned them against reopening the plant. If they persist, we will block the road to the plant and take to the streets to protest against it,” said Vaibhav Konde, a villager and the vice-president of the Nira River Sangharsha Samiti. Sachin More, president of the samiti, said, “The chemical plant is located in a residential zone and is just half-a-kilometre away from Nira river. We have been demanding its relocation to a chemical zone as its effluents have polluted the river.” The plant is located on the boundaries of four talukas in Pune and Satara districts — Baramati, Purandar, Phaltan and Khandala. Bhatghar dam and Veer dam are built on the river. “About 300 villages in theses talukas are dependent on Nira river for agriculture and domestic use. They also have been protesting against the plant for many years,” Santosh Mohite, a villager, said. The chemical plant is not the lone cause of pollution to the river. “There are distilleries and sugar factories located along the river, which are equally responsible for the pollution. However, we oppose the plant because it manufactures toxic chemicals, putting the lives of those of us living close to it at risk,” Nira resident Deepak More said. Vivek Prakash, a senior official of Jubiliant Life Sciences’ corporate social responsibility wing, who met the villagers on Friday, told TOI that they will take the villagers’ demand to the company’s higher authorities. “The affected workers are our own people. We will not deny them anything they are owed. But the villagers’ demand to relocate the plant is unjust. The plant functions as per the norms. However, we will communicate their demand to our higher authorities,” Prakash told TOI. On compensation to the affected workers, Prakash said, “A compensation is definitely under consideration. The chemical leak was unfortunate. The company has made all efforts to rehabilitate the affected, apart from bearing the cost of their medical treatment.” ",20 Apr 2019,2019-04-20 00:00:00

China sentences military veterans for protesting,China sentences military veterans for protesting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-sentences-military-veterans-for-protesting/articleshow/68953018.cms,en,"BEIJING: Chinese courts announced multiple-year prison sentences Friday for more than three dozen military veterans who protested over the lack of benefits, saying the former soldiers had disrupted social order in a bid to further their own interests. The announcements from the courts in the eastern provinces of Shandong and Jiangsu follow repeated demonstrations by veterans of various ages who say they haven't been adequately compensated for their service. Veterans have long been organising quietly, but in recent years have staged attention-getting protests outside government offices and the defence ministry's headquarters in Beijing that prompted the government to establish a Ministry of Veterans Affairs last year. The 47 sentenced to up to six years had been involved in protests last year that involved hundreds of former soldiers. China's ruling Communist Party tightly restricts all public demonstrations and while it relies on the armed forces to maintain its hold on power, many veterans say they have been left to fend for themselves on meager pensions and little support. Such complaints came to a head last year when more than 1,000 retired soldiers, including locals and many others who rushed in from around the country, descended on government offices in the eastern city of Zhenjiang , in Jiangsu province. For four days, they occupied a public plaza and a street, singing and chanting as they demanded answers over the alleged beating of a fellow veteran by government-hired thugs after he petitioned for better benefits, supporters said. Scenes of paramilitary police and armoured vehicles lining Zhenjiang's streets further exacerbated the fraught relationship between the government and disgruntled veterans.

Nusrat Jahan Rafi told her family she was lured to the roof of her rural school in the town of Feni on April 6 and asked to withdraw the charges by five people clad in burqas. When she refused, she said her hands were tied and she was doused in kerosene and set alight. Rafi told the story to her brother in an ambulance on the way to the hospital and he recorded her testimony on his mobile phone. She died four days later in a Dhaka hospital with burns covering 80% of her body. The violence has shaken Bangladesh, triggering protests and raising concerns over the plight of women and girls in the conservative Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people where sexual harassment and violence are often unreported, victims are intimidated and the legal process is often lengthy. Many avoid reporting to police because of social stigma. ""We want justice. Our girls must grow up safely and with dignity,"" Alisha Pradhan, a model and actress, told The Associated Press during Friday's demonstration. ""We protest any forms of violence against women, and authorities must ensure justice."" Tens of thousands of people attended Rafi's funeral prayers in Feni, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised Rafi's family when they met in Dhaka that those responsible would be punished. At least 17 people, including students, have been arrested in connection with the case, said Banaj Kumar Majumder, the head of the Police Bureau of Investigation. In late March, Rafi filed a complaint with police that the principal of her madrasa, or Islamic school, had called her into his office and touched her inappropriately and repeatedly. Her family agreed to help her to file the police complaint, which prompted police to arrest the principal, infuriating him and his supporters. Influential local politicians backed the principal, and ruling party members were also among the arrested. Police said the arrested suspects told them during interrogations that the attack on Rafi was planned and ordered by the school's principal from prison when his men went to see him. It was timed for daytime so that it would look like a suicide attempt, Majumder said. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that Rafi's family said that they had received death threats before the attack telling them to drop the case. While Rafi's case is now being treated with urgency, that wasn't the case until her death. A video taken on March 27 while Rafi reported the assault shows the local police chief registering her complaint but telling her that the incident was ""not a big deal."" The chief was later removed from the police station for negligence in dealing with the case. For Bangladeshi women, it is often not easy to file sensitive complaints with police. Victims often fear further harassment and bullying. Police also often show an unwillingness to investigate such cases and are often accused of being influenced by local politics or bribes. But the call for dealing with violence against women, especially related to sexual harassment and assault, is also getting louder. ""The horrifying murder of a brave woman who sought justice shows how badly the Bangladesh government has failed victims of sexual assault,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""Nusrat Jahan Rafi's death highlights the need for the Bangladesh government to take survivors of sexual assault seriously and ensure that they can safely seek a legal remedy and be protected from retaliation.""

A teenage girl Naina was allegedly kidnapped from Rahim Yar Khan last month by an influential person Tahir Tamri with the help of his father and brothers. According to the FIR lodged by Naina’s father Ragu Ram on April 5, six people had abducted his daughter on March 13 and the main suspect, Tahir Tamri, had taken her to the southern port city of Karachi . On March 14, the FIR said, she was converted to Islam at a seminary, Jamiatul Saeed Gulshan-i-Maimar, in Karachi. The complainant stated that after conversion to Islam, Naina was given a Muslim name Noor Fatima before tying a matrimonial knot with the suspect. Her father said the video of embracing Islam and solemnising Nikkah was uploaded on social media. Following failure of police to recover the girl in last two weeks, members of the Hindu community came on roads in Liaquatpur in Rahim Yar Khan district blocking the main highway for traffic. Their protest entered the second day on Thursday with members of the community holding placards and banners outside the Liaquatpur Press Club and chanting slogans against forced conversions of Hindu girls. “Stop the forced conversion of Hindu girls after kidnapping them,” read a placard. During the protest the girl’s parents reportedly threatened that they would set their house ablaze if they were not provided justice. Police, however, assured the protesters that they would use all possible resources to provide them justice. Umar Farooq Salamat, Rahim Yar Khan’s top police officer, said that he has sent a police party to Karachi for the recovery of the girl. The protesters ended their demonstration after being assured by police that the justice would be done.

They alleged that the Chandrayangutta police had let off key conspirators behind the murder of Fatima Sadi, 22, a resident of Salala Barkas, who was stabbed to death by her husband Ahmed Ba Ismail on March 5.“The accused had surrendered before the Chandrayangutta police, but the other key conspirators were let off by the police,” they said. ""The slow pace of investigation has forced us to raise our voice against the injustice. We have been protesting and demanding fair and transparent probe into the matter and will move the court against the injustice,” said Ali Saadi, the victim’s father. Station House Officer, Chandrayangutta, G. Koteshwar Rao termed the allegations baseless and said that the probe was conducted as per law. ""Following complaints, the accused were booked and jailed,'' said Rao. The protesters also demanded that the kin of the accused be moved out of the locality. ",20 Apr 2019,2019-04-20 00:00:00
Sudan protest leaders to unveil civilian ruling body,Sudan protest leaders to unveil civilian ruling body,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/sudan-protest-leaders-to-unveil-civilian-ruling-body/articleshow/68953659.cms,en,"KHARTOUM: Protest leaders Friday announced plans to unveil a civilian body to take over from Sudan 's ruling military council as crowds of demonstrators kept up the pressure outside army headquarters and Washington said it will send an envoy to encourage the transition. The military council, which took power after ousting Sudan 's longtime leader Omar al-Bashir on April 11, has so far resisted calls from protesters to quickly make way for a civilian adminstration. The Sudanese Professionals Association, which has been spearheading the protests, said in a statement that the civilian council members would be named at a news conference at 1700 GMT on Sunday outside the army complex to which foreign diplomats are also invited. ""We are demanding that this civilian council, which will have representatives of the army, replace the military council,"" Ahmed al-Rabia, a leader of the umbrella group of unions for doctors, engineers and teachers, told AFP. Four months after anti-regime protests started, access roads were packed on Friday with crowds flocking to huge square outside army headquarters. Activists mobilised demonstrators through social media to keep up the pressure for replacing the military council, now led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. ""Power to civilians, power to civilians,"" protesters chanted through Thursday night. ""I won't leave until Burhan transfers power to a civilian government,"" said Wali Aldeen, who has camped outside the complex since the day Bashir was ousted. Activists have called for large crowds to gather after weekly Muslim prayers, as on previous Fridays. Protests first broke out on December 19 in response to the tripling of bread prices, swiftly turning into nationwide rallies against Bashir's three-decade rule. After his ouster, protesters demonstrated against General Awad Ibn Ouf who took over as the first head of the military council, insisting he was a tool of the old regime. Ibn Ouf stepped down in less than 24 hours and was replaced by Burhan, who so far has appeased protesters by lifting a night-time curfew and vowing to ""uproot"" Bashir's circle. The United States on Thursday praised orders by Sudan 's new military leader to free political prisoners and end the curfew as it dispatched Makila James , a deputy assistant secretary of state, on a mission to Khartoum this weekend. The United States will ""calibrate our policies based on our assessment of events"", State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said, adding however that talks on delisting Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism remained suspended. ""We are encouraged by the decision to release political prisoners and cancel the curfew in Khartoum,"" Ortagus said in a statement. She said that the United States wanted the military council and other armed units to ""show restraint, avoid conflict and remain committed to the protection of the Sudanese people."" ""The will of the Sudanese people is clear: it is time to move toward a transitional government that is inclusive and respectful of human rights and the rule of law,"" she said. A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington's short-term goal was to ""get the military folks out of centre-stage"" and ""back to being responsible for security, nothing else."" ""Longer term is to make absolutely sure that whichever group is going to be responsible for the transition prepares a transition implementation that will lead to a truly democratic government that will reflect the will of the Sudanese people,"" he said. The official did not specify whom James would meet in Khartoum but said, ""the US engages with everyone."" ",19 Apr 2019,2019-04-19 00:00:00

The Sadou Asom Swahid Pariyal Samannayrakhi Parishad, the coordination committee of such families, had extended full support to AGP till the 1996 assembly polls when the party formed government in Assam for the second term. Though the support was there even after AGP's defeat in the 2001 assembly election, it slowly started diminishing due to a number of reasons. But now, these families are distancing themselves from the regional party that was formed by the agitators of the movement following the signing of the Assam Accord in 1985. ""AGP leaders stated that though they have formed an alliance with BJP in this Lok Sabha polls, the regional party will think about the citizenship bill in its own way. But this very stand is suspicious. When AGP was part of the BJP-led government in Assam (since 2016), the coalition government failed to detect and deport illegal migrants as assured prior to the election. Instead, BJP tried hard to grant citizenship to illegal migrants (by attempting to pass the citizenship bill). We don't have much expectations from the alliance. So, we have left it to the people of Assam to decide on AGP's fate,"" said Chandra Kanta Talukdar, secretary of the coordination committee and younger brother of Khargeswar Talukdar, who is regarded as the first martyr of the anti-foreigners' movement. He added, ""If AGP doesn't formulate a clear strategy to fight the primary issue of illegal migrants in Assam and keep itself engaged in alliance politics, we will be compelled to announce an alternate political decision for the sake of the martyrs' sacrifice before the 2021 assembly elections."" Though Congress supported the anti-citizenship bill movement that swept Assam early this year, Talukdar said the martyrs' families have been considering the opposition party as an 'arch-rival' and their stand on Congress remains the same since the days of the anti-foreigners' movement. Considering all its limitations, a steering committee call has been given to the district units of the martyrs' families to choose 'competent candidates' whom they feel trustworthy for safeguarding the interests of Assam by curbing illegal influx. ""At this moment, we have no other option than appealing to voters to chose the candidates whom they believe competent for raising their issues in Parliament. We are no more in a position to support one particular political party, especially after seeing the hazy stand of AGP and BJP on the citizenship issue,"" said Talukdar. Upset over the NDA government's move to pass the controversial citizenship bill in the Lok Sabha in January, several families of those killed in the anti-foreigners movement had returned the honours they had received from the Sarbananda Sonowal government in 2016. AGP, which had parted ways with BJP at that time following differences over the citizenship bill, had also expressed solidarity with the martyrs' families. However, its decision to rejoin the BJP alliance on the eve of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls was opposed by the families. ",18 Apr 2019,2019-04-18 00:00:00

At the end of the month, he took home Rs 14,000 that was sufficient to pay for the family's modest needs. The last wage he received was in end-February. When the cash-starved airline failed to pay the salary for March, Goswami did not disclose anything to his parents or wife. But they came to know about the truth when he was unable to pay his son's tuition fees at the beginning of this month. Ranjan Hazra (45), a maintenance helper with the airline for 14 years, has not received his wage in March. His salary of Rs 15,500 was enough to make ends meet. With no salary for 46 days, he has run up dues at the local provision store and also borrowed money from friends with no idea when he will be able to repay the debts. Goswami and Hazra are among 462 contactual employees in Kolkata, who are struggling to come to terms with the reality of an airline, which is precariously perched on the cusp of going bust. They have launched an agitation before the old domestic terminal at Kolkata airport, sitting on dharna before the Jet Airways office and holding rallies. ""If the management does not listen, we may escalate the movement to a hungerstrike,"" said Goswami. Sadly, even those in managerial positions in the airline also face an uncertain future and are in no position to provide any assurance. Right from veteran pilots with salary of 4 lakh to airport ground staff drawing Rs 30,000-35,000 a month, there has been no salary since February. Even those who drew fancy salaries like general managers and pilots are feeling the pinch as they have not been paid for three months. A captain, who has been with Jet Airways for two decades, has restricted his social life to not only avoid the embarrassment of answering awkward questions on the company and his future, but also to cut down on expense. ""One cuts one's coat according to the cloth. I led a certain life when I had a regular salary. I tried to maintain that for a couple of months. But with savings now getting depleted, I have to make adjustments,"" said the captain who has earned around Rs 4 lakh, a month of which EMI accounted for Rs 1.25 lakh. While he is in a position to cut down on his expenses and eke out a living till the airline revives or he finds employment, a young pilot with salary of Rs 1 lakh, who had taken a loan of Rs 30 lakh against an EMI of around Rs 30,000 to get trained for Jet Aiways, is now staring at defaults and his family house being confiscated by the bank. ""I had mortaged the house for the loan, hoping to pay it off in three years. But soon I may be without a roof if the airline doesn't start flying again,"" he said. Suddho Ghosh, who had joined Jet Airways in 1994, the year the airline started services from Kolkata, before quitting it to join Kingfisher Airlines that he left just before the airline went bust, says the Jet scenario is a virtual replay of what happened at Kingfisher in 2012-13. ""The wife of a Bengali engineer who was posted in Mumbai had committed suicide due to the financial turmoil that the family had been thrust into after Kingfisher was grounded.

They complained that they were getting contaminated water for past two months increasing risk of various water-borne diseases. Residents reached Shivshakti Nagar overhead tank at around 9.00am and started protesting against Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC). They alleged that despite repeated requests, no action has been taken to solve their problems. “We are living under constant threat of diseases as water supplied to our area is mixed with sewerage water,” Gunita Bhalekar, one of the protesting residents said. Mahesh Tayde another protesting resident said that the water is often yellow in colour and emanates foul smell. “This is the water we are supposed to use for drinking, cooking and other purposes?” he said. Protesting residents said that they were left with no option but to launch protest. “A number of times we have raised the issue with ward corporator, but problem remains. Corporation has not taken any step to resolve our problem,” they added. Residents entered zonal office premises and started chanting slogans against IMC. The protest ended after MC officials assuring them to solve the problem in next two days. IMC’s additional commissioner Sandeep Soni said that instructions have been issued to check supply lines of the area. “There might be a leakage in water supply line and drainage line network, owing to which drain water is getting mixed with Narmada water. We are checking pipelines for leakage,” he said, adding that problem will be solved within two days, and till then we will make arrangement for supply through tanker.

"No water, no vote: Dhamni Valley villagers boycott polls","No water, no vote: Dhamni Valley villagers boycott polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/maharashtra/news/no-water-no-vote-dhamni-valley-villagers-boycott-polls/articleshow/68912597.cms,en,"KOLHAPUR: Representatives of the Dhamni Khora Vikas Kruti Samiti, which comprises about 60 clusters of villages on the banks of River Dhamni, forced a team of election officials to beat a retreat on Tuesday afternoon. Election officials literally “faced the music” as the villagers sang “powadas” (ballads) to them when the officials sought reasons for why they were planning to boycott Lok Sabha polls. The villagers are determined to boycott polling here, scheduled on April 23. Officials have been visiting them to persuade them to vote . People in these villages are facing the worst spell of water scarcity in about three decades. There are about 35,000 eligible voters in the 60 villages of Dhamni Valley, large enough numbers to swing the election outcome in Kolhapur constituency. And indeed the people of the area have swung results in the past two Lok Sabha elections. Water experts say it is ironical that although the Dhamni river basin receives an average of over 5,000 mm of rainfall, there is no dam to hold water and it flows away. Villagers have erected makeshift weirs, at their own expense, to store what water they can, especially for use in summer. The gram panchayats of the cluster villages passed the resolutions to boycott polling and submitted them to the district administration, the chief minister’s office, and the state governor’s office. “We have just got a reply from district collector’s office, seeking to convince us to exercise our franchise on April 23. The collector visited Mhasurli village , the centre of the Dhamni river basin, on Sunday, April 14, to convince us to vote. We are not going to budge. Until there is a resolution to our water problems, we will not vote,” said Sarjerao Patil, one of the members of the action committee formed to address the issue. Patil said that after elections were announced, a few political candidates visited the villages. They were all ignored by villagers. Villager Shahaji Patil said farmers have to pay from their pockets for digging weirs in the river bed. The water lasts just a few weeks, sometimes days. The gram sabhas last month appealed to villagers to unite against the government and its disinterest in the issues that matter to them. “We are committed, we are united, and we want a resolution on the issue in any case. We are not going to help any politician, unless he addressed the issue or at least tries to resolve it,” he said. District collector and returning officer Daulat Desai told TOI, that work on the dam is set to begin, once the stay imposed on it is lifted and the dues owed to the former contractor are paid. New tenders will then be floated, he said. “Villagers should understand that whether they boycott polling or not, work on the dam will begin. And if work is going to start, why cannot they just exercise their franchise,” the collector asked. Dam 80% complete; stuck since 2012 Dhamni Dam, with total capacity of 3.85 TMC, according to district administration officials, was first sanctioned in 1996 with allocation of Rs 120 crore. It was meant to provide drinking water to villages in Radhanagari, Gaganbawda, and Panhala talukas. The project was delayed and approved again with revised administrative approval of Rs 320 crore in the year 2000. Construction is now 80% complete, and has been stuck since 2012. The contractor, according to sources, filed a case in court seeking payment of dues of Rs 277 crore in the year 2017. There have been 34 hearings in the matter so far, and the case continues. The next hearing is on April 25. ",17 Apr 2019,2019-04-17 00:00:00

The incident took place at Kilesapuram village under Ibrahimpatnam mandal in Krishna district on Tuesday.

According to cops, the woman used to work in a private company and got acquainted to Joseph three years ago. He allegedly sexually exploited her under the pretext of marriage and love. The woman, in her complaint, claimed that after she disclosed the matter to both her parents, they agreed for marriage. “However, Joseph created a scene falsely accusing me of having an affair with another man just to avoid me,” the woman said while addressing the media. She went on to say, “he did not want to marry me so that he could get dowry elsewhere.” While Joseph’s parents are seeking for a settlement, the 25-year-old is seeking police action against him. Extending support to the victim, women activists reached Joseph’s house and raised slogans against him and his family members. ",17 Apr 2019,2019-04-17 00:00:00

The protests started soon after the BJP declared the name of VD Sharma as the BJP candidate from Khajuraho, so far represented by Nagendra Singh , who hails from Satna. Sanjay Nagaich, a prominent BJP leader from Panna, part of Khajuraho seat, said, “ the outsider factor is dominating here and we have asked the party leadership to reconsider his candidature.” He claimed, “ it is very difficult to convince the people and the local workers and the moment they learn that VD Sharma belongs to Chambal region, they start protest.” He said that Khajuraho people suffered last time as Nagendra Singh also belonged to Satna. He said that the party had made commitment to him to give ticket for the Lok Sabha elections but denied at the last moment. Amidst protests, on Tuesday, Sharma held meeting of party workers in Panna. Talking to TOI, he said, “ all those who have been protesting belong to the BJP family and many of them have worked with me.

Demonstrators began blocking off a bridge and major central road junctions on Monday at the start of a civil disobedience campaign that also saw action in other parts of Europe. The protests were organised by the campaign group Extinction Rebellion, which was established last year in Britain by academics and has become one of the world's fastest-growing environmental movements. London's Metropolitan Police said that by Tuesday evening, 290 arrests had been made. ""We expect demonstrations to continue throughout the coming weeks,"" the police statement said. The arrest figure includes three men and two women who were detained at the UK offices of energy giant Royal Dutch Shell on suspicion of criminal damage. Campaigners daubed graffiti and smashed a window at the Shell Centre building. The majority arrested were seized for breaching public order laws and obstructing a highway. The protest saw more than a thousand people block off central London's Waterloo Bridge and lay trees in pots along its length. Later, people set up camps in Hyde Park in preparation for further demonstrations throughout the week. The police have ordered the protesters to confine themselves to a zone within Marble Arch, a space at the junction of Hyde Park, the Oxford Street main shopping thoroughfare and the Park Lane street of plush hotels. ""We so far have 55 bus routes closed and 500,000 people affected as a result,"" the police said. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""extremely concerned"" about protesters' plans to disrupt the underground on Wednesday. ""Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change,"" he said in a statement. Campaigners want governments to declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and be led by new ""citizens' assemblies on climate and ecological justice"". Extinction Rebellion spokesman James Fox said the group had attempted to maintain a blockade overnight at four sites in central London before the police came to impose the new restriction. Protesters attached themselves to vehicles and to each other using bicycle locks, said the spokesman. ""We have no intention of leaving until the government listens to us,"" he said. ""Many of us are willing to sacrifice our liberty for the cause."" ",17 Apr 2019,2019-04-17 00:00:00

Thousands of demonstrators have continued to rally in support of demands for civilian rule, despite an apparent attempt to disperse them following the ouster last week of veteran president Omar al-Bashir . ""We want the military council to be dissolved and be replaced by a civilian council having representatives of the army,"" said Mohamed Naji, a senior leader of the Sudanese Professionals Association. The organisation which spearheaded months of protests leading to Bashir's fall also demanded the sacking of the country's judiciary chief and prosecutor general. The SPA's latest demands came as the military council faced mounting public and diplomatic pressure to hand over power to a civilian administration. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for ""a rapid transfer of power to a civilian transitional government,"" in a phone call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. ""This must be followed by a credible, inclusive political process that meets the expectations of the Sudanese people with regard to economic and political reforms,"" her office said in a statement. Sisi meanwhile reiterated Egypt 's support for ""the brotherly Sudanese people's will"" and said Cairo would ""not interfere in its internal affairs"", according to a presidential statement. Their comments come a day after the Khartoum embassies of Britain, the United States and Norway issued a joint statement calling for ""inclusive dialogue to effect a transition to civilian rule"". Outside army headquarters crowds remained camped outside the complex, despite SPA warnings of ""an attempt to disperse the sit-in"". ""We call on our people to come immediately to the sit-in area to protect our revolution,"" the SPA said in a statement, without saying who was responsible. Witnesses said several army vehicles had surrounded the area and that troops were seen removing the barricades which demonstrators had put up as a security measure. ""I felt frustrated when they tried to break the sit-in, but I still trust the army because it's not possible that they would give up on protesters,"" said demonstrator Mohamed al-Fatih. Portraits of people killed in the months of rallies covered the facades of several buildings in the area. ""Until we see tangible results, we are not moving from here,"" said protester Abdulhadi Hajj Ahmed. A 10-member delegation representing the protesters delivered a list of demands during talks with the council late Saturday, according to a statement by the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella group. But in a news conference, the council's spokesman did not respond to the protesters' demands. The military council however met with political parties on Sunday, urging them to agree on an ""independent figure"" to be prime minister, an AFP correspondent at the meeting said. ""We want to set up a civilian state based on freedom, justice and democracy ,"" a council member, Lieutenant General Yasser al-Ata, told members of several political parties. The foreign ministry said military council head General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was ""committed to having a complete civilian government"" and urged other nations to back the council in order to achieve ""the Sudanese goal of democratic transition"". Burhan has pledged that individuals implicated in killing protesters would be held to account and that demonstrators detained under a state of emergency imposed by the president during his final weeks in power would be freed. The SPA says Bashir must also face justice, along with officials from his feared National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) whose chief Salih Ghosh resigned on Saturday. As part of the shake-up at the top, a new NISS head and army chief of staff have been appointed. Bashir ruled Sudan with an iron fist for 30 years before he was deposed last week following mass protests that have rocked the country since December. The SPA has additionally called for the confiscation of properties belonging to the ousted president's National Congress Party and the release of soldiers who sided with their movement. Late on Sunday, the military council said it has set up a committee to register NCP properties and seize control of them. ",15 Apr 2019,2019-04-15 00:00:00

A recent study, which took into account samples from different water sources available on the campus, revealed that water supplied to various departments, hostels and campus residences is not fit for consumption and contain — among other contaminants — the E Coli bacteria. However, surprisingly, BU officers are getting good quality water. The study — undertaken by a department of BU — has revealed that water distributed to students and employees in the campus is of very bad quality and they are vulnerable to several diseases.BU employees have complained to the university administration for allegedly supplying dirty water to them and clean water to the officers. On the condition of anonymity, a senior faculty of BU associated with the study claimed that BU needs to install better quality purifiers and water coolers. “Samples were collected from various parts of the university. Water quality is seriously poor,” said the faculty. He said waterborne pathogens are a global concern for worldwide public health. “Since pathogens in water are still a major cause of severe illness and mortality, the control, monitoring and application of regulations for water quality are urgently needed and must incorporate more effective microbiological monitoring, pathogen detection and health risk assessment in order to reach the goal of pathogen-free water,” he said. He added that index pathogens for monitoring water quality have been selected in order to indicate the presence of a large amount of pathogens in the campus water. He claimed that among these pathogens, E. Coli has been extensively present. “Water quality in BU is seriously bad. Anyone using it without purifiers is vulnerable. It needs to be checked,” said the faculty. Water distribution to the employees and officers of the university are reportedly from different sources. “Water distributed to the officers is from a cleaned well situated near the temple on the campus. We get water from a well near the aquaculture department. One look at the aquaculture well is enough to understand the poor quality of water being supplied to us,” said an employee who did not wish to be quoted. Incidentally, employees had written a letter to the higher authorities for supplying bad quality of water to them and in the hostels while the good quality of water is being provided to officers. Following this, the registrar had directed the engineers to address the issue within a week. Employees claim to have checked the total dissolved solids (TDS) of water distributed to them and the officers. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an employee said, “Officers are given water having TDS level of around 135, which implies that the water condition is good. On the contrary, the TDS level of water distributed to employees is over 450, which is not good for use.” TDS are inorganic compounds that are found in water such as salts, heavy metals and some traces of organic compounds that are dissolved in water. Excluding the organic matters that are sometimes naturally present in water and the environment, some of these compounds or substances can be essential in life. But, it can be harmful when the body takes in more than the desired amount. The university staff said they will protest against the administration to raise their demands. Incidentally, BU hostellers have already raised the issue of poor quality of water supplied to them. Though the registrar has directed the engineers to address the issue within a week, students called the directive a mere formality and questioned how the authorities can fix the issue in a week when they have been left unaddressed for years. Students claim that despite several complaints, no action was taken by the authorities. Incidentally, RTI activist and former student of BU, Dharmendra Singh Gour, on Saturday filed a complaint with Raj Bhawan for such poor conditions of the hostels. “I was also a hosteller in the past. I had never seen such a poor situation during my stay in the hostel. I hope higher authorities will look into the matter,” he said. The BU campus accommodates three boys’ hostels —Sanjay Gandhi, Munshi Premchand and Jawaharlal Nehru — each with a capacity for 100 students. Of these, Sanjay Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru are the worst-affected. University officials refused to comment on the issue. ",15 Apr 2019,2019-04-15 00:00:00

Sudan protesters demand 'immediate' civilian rule,Sudan protesters demand 'immediate' civilian rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/sudan-protesters-demand-immediate-civilian-rule/articleshow/68882888.cms,en,"KHARTOUM: Sudanese protesters on Sunday demanded the country's military rulers ""immediately"" hand power over to a civilian government that should then bring ousted leader Omar al-Bashir to justice. Thousands remained encamped outside Khartoum's army headquarters to keep up pressure on a military council that took power after ousting Bashir on Thursday. The organisation that spearheaded the protests against Bashir, the Sudanese Professionals Association, called on the council ""to immediately transfer power to a civilian government"". The SPA also demanded the next ""transitional government and the armed forces bring Bashir and all the chiefs of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS)... to justice"". ""The Sudanese Professionals Association calls on its supporters to continue with the sit-in until the revolution achieves its demands,"" it added. The military council later held a press conference at which its spokesman did not respond to the protesters' latest demands. Instead it announced the appointment of a new intelligence chief. Earlier the military council met with political parties and urged them to agree on an ""independent figure"" to be prime minister, an AFP correspondent present at the meeting said. ""We want to set up a civilian state based on freedom, justice and democracy ,"" a council member, Lieutenant General Yasser al-Ata, told several political parties, urging them to agree on the figures to sit in civilian government. The protesters have insisted civilian representatives must join the military council. A 10-member delegation representing the protesters delivered their demands during talks with the council late Saturday, according to a statement by the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella group spearheading the rallies. The foreign ministry urged the international community to back the military council ""to achieve the Sudanese goal of democratic transition"". It said council chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was ""committed to having a complete civilian government and the role of the council will be to maintain the sovereignty of the country"". Talks between protest leaders and Sudan 's new rulers were followed Sunday by a meeting between Washington's top envoy to Khartoum, Steven Koutsis, and the military council's deputy. Mohammad Hamdan Daglo, widely known as Himeidti, told Koutsis ""about the measures taken by the military council to preserve the security and stability of the country,"" the official SUNA news agency reported. Himeidti is a field commander for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) counter-insurgency unit, which rights groups have accused of abuses in the war-torn Darfur region. On Saturday, the military council's new chief General Burhan vowed to dismantle Bashir's regime, lifting a night-time curfew with immediate effect. He also pledged that individuals implicated in killing protesters would face justice and that protesters detained under a state of emergency imposed by Bashir during his final weeks in power would be freed. Burhan took the oath of office on Friday after his predecessor General Awad Ibn Ouf stepped down little more than 24 hours after Bashir's ouster. The United States, Britain and Norway said Sunday it was time for Sudan's military rulers and other parties to hold talks over the country's transition to civilian rule. ""This must be done credibly and swiftly, with protest leaders, political opposition, civil society organisations, and all relevant elements of society, including women,"" the embassies of the three countries said in a statement. Tens of thousands of people have massed non-stop outside the army headquarters since April 6, initially to urge the military to back their demand that Bashir be removed. Burhan comes with less baggage from Bashir's deeply unpopular rule than Ibn Ouf, a former defence minister and longtime close aide of the deposed president. But while celebrating the fall of both men in quick succession, protesters remain cautious. Protest leaders say their demands include restructuring the country's feared NISS agency, whose chief Salih Ghosh resigned on Saturday. On Sunday night, the council announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Abu Baker Mustafa as the new head of NISS in a televised announcement in which it also announced the sacking of Khartoum's envoy to Washington Mohamed Atta. The newly formed 10-member transitional council contains several faces from Bashir's regime. On Saturday evening, the new military ruler named NISS deputy head Jalaluddin Sheikh to the council, with Himeidti as its deputy head. ""Himeidti was part of the crimes that happened previously, but at least now he is on the side of the people,"" said Mohamed, a protester outside the army headquarters who gave only his first name for security reasons. Key regional power brokers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have voiced support for the transitional council. Sudan is part of a UAE and Saudi-led military coalition fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen. But Qatar, which wielded some influence over Bashir's regime before Khartoum joined ranks with Riyadh in Yemen, has remained silent on the protests. The gas-rich country is locked in a nearly two-year-old diplomatic standoff with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt. ",15 Apr 2019,2019-04-15 00:00:00

The BJP also warned the state government of strong protest if it decides to go ahead with the plan to 'usurp’ the temple. BJP state spokesperson B Gopalakrishnan has alleged that Kerala government was trying to bring the temple and its treasures worth crores under its control. ""The government has no business in any temple. By proposing a Guruvayur-model administration, Pinarayi Vijayan is trying to usurp the temple. The temple and its treasure belongs to the deity and the deity belongs to the devotees. No government has any role in this. BJP would support the protests against the government plans to take over the temple administration,"" Gopalakrishnan said. Padmanabha Swamy temple is one of the richest temples in the world and the earstwhile Travancore royal family, the custodians of the temple, and a number of devotees and Hindu organisations have approached the Supreme Court against a Kerala high court verdict that the temple may be taken over by the state government. According to the BJP leader, the UDF leaders, especially Congress leaders who claim to have stood for the protection of faith in Sabarimala should openly declare their stand on the government's proposal. ""Both these fronts have same objectives. The UDF must be thinking that the proposal would also give them opportunity in the future. Pinarayi Vijayan government will have to pay a heavy price if it goes ahead with its plans to control the temple and its belongings though its nominees. Government should better alter its stand and take steps to ensure that the administration of the temple rests with the devotees, not the government,"" he said. ",15 Apr 2019,2019-04-15 00:00:00

The 2018 report on terrorism , first released in December last year, drew the ire of the Sikh community at the time of its release as it was the first time it listed Sikh extremism as one of the top five extremist threats in Canada , the Toronto-based CBC news said. Singh protested the Trudeau administration's decision, saying it ""succumbed to domestic political pressure"". ""The move is a threat to Indian and global security,"" he said. Amarinder said the ""knee-jerk decision"" by the ruling Canadian Liberal Party was aimed at protecting its political interests in an election year. It could have serious consequences for the Indo-Canadian relations in the long run, Singh said. ""(Canadian Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau is playing with fire with his decision to assuage inflamed domestic passions through this ill-considered move,"" he claimed. The world cannot afford to fan extremism in any form, which is what the Trudeau government is effectively doing with such ill-thought moves, he added. He pointed out that he himself had given proof to the Canadian Prime Minister during his India visit last year, of his country's soil being used to spread the separatist Khalistani ideology against a friendly country. Trudeau had been informed of Khalistani activists being involved in financing terror activities in India from Canada, said the chief minister in a statement here Sunday. Singh had handed over to the Canadian Prime Minister a list of nine Canada-based operatives allegedly involved in promoting radicalism in Punjab, which has the highest number of Sikhs in India. The chief minister dubbed the ""erasure of the various references to Khalistan and Khalistani organisations"" from the latest threat report ""as an unpardonable act in the eyes of the peace-loving global community."" ""It is obvious that Trudeau had played safe in view of the upcoming elections in Canada, giving in to pressure within his country. In the process, he has quite blatantly ignored the adverse impact this could have not only on Canada's relations with India but also on geopolitical stability,"" he added. The updated version of the '2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada' was released on Friday, Toronto-based CBC news quoted The Canadian Press news agency as saying. The language in the report was changed to remove any mention of religion, instead discussing the threat posed by ""extremists who support violent means to establish an independent state within India"", it reported.

Since it was established in 2013, this was the first time that the Tripura high court convened at midnight to conduct a hearing. Hearing a petition moved by the state government at 9pm to challenge a lower court’s decision, Chief Justice Sanjoy Karol stayed the interim bail order till the next hearing on April 15. Health services across the state have been severely affected over the last couple of days, with private clinics, chambers, diagnostic centres and pathology laboratories remaining closed in protest against the attack on the doctor . Chief minister Biplab Deb had said on Friday said that the state would file a petition in the high court, seeking cancellation of the bail order passed by a judicial magistrate. On Wednesday evening, after a pregnant woman, Mampi Das (20), died in the labour room of the state referral IGM hospital, her friends and relatives, led by her husband Gabinda Das, had reportedly attacked the resident gynaecologist Dr Dipanakar Debnath, dragging him away from the hospital, severely assaulting him and leaving him by the roadside. Dr Debnath, who was found lying in a sewage drain in front of Agartala Municipal Corporation office, has been undergoing treatment at Agartala Government Medical College. He is reportedly in a stable condition now. Immediately after the attack on the doctor, police had arrested five accused and booked them under non-bailable sections, with charges of attempt to murder and kidnapping against them. But the local court had granted them bail, leading to widespread protests among doctors. The government then moved the high court, seeking cancellation of the bail order. Though the doctors’ bodies called off their protest on Saturday, they demanded action against all the accused involved in carrying out attacks on doctors and health workers in the state. At least 13 such incidents were reported from hospitals in Tripura in the last one year. Last week, Sabroom BJP Mandal president Arjun Debnath had reportedly barged into the Srinagar Primary health centre and thrown his shoes at Dr Dipal Mitra. The accused has not been arrested yet. The doctors’ bodies also demanded custodial trial for all the accused in these cases, improvement in working condition and better security for doctors, including installing CCTV cameras across all hospitals in the state. On Friday evening, health minister Sudip Roybarman had surrendered his personal security escort in protest against the attack. The Tripura government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.

'Sabarimala Karma Samithi', which had spearheaded the agitation against the CPI(M)-led LDF government's decision to implement the Supreme Court September 28 verdict permitting women of all age groups into the shrine, alleged that their members had been implicated in various criminal cases ""unlawfully"". Braving the scorching heat, a number of activists, including women, squatted on the road in front of the Secretariat here, and held 'namajapa' protest by chanting Lord Ayyappa hymns near the god's picture. The outfit's protest, days before the April 23 Lok Sabha polls, rekindles the memories of the Sabarimala agitation, which had seen frenzied protests by devotees across the state and the alleged police action against them. The parliamentary election in Kerala will be held in a single phase on April 23. Addressing the gathering, Swami Chidanandapuri of the Kolathur Adavaitha Ashram here urged the Hindu community not to forget the ""barbaric acts"" of the police against the devotees during the Sabarimala protests. ""The Karma Samithi will continue to raise the Sabarimala issue. It will not be a violation of the model code of conduct as the outfit is neither a political party nor a political movement,"" Chidanandapuri, who is also the chief patron of the Samithi, said. The seer said the left government had no moral right to continue in the office in the wake of the action taken against the Ayyappa devotees. Samithi leader K P Sasikala, who was arrested during the protests, said the outfit would extend support to those who had stood by them and the devotees during the stir. Hitting at the state police for allegedly registering ""false cases"" against the Samithi activists and devotees, former DGP T P Senkumar said the police should act in accordance with the Indian Penal Code and CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). ""They should implement the rule of law and not the law of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan . Don't try to scare anyone by registering false cases,"" Senkumar, national vice-president of Sabarimala Action Council, said. Sources in the ruling LDF said the party would petition the Election Commission against the dharna staged by the right-wing outfit. Kerala last year had for days witnessed a series of violent protests by various groups of devotees and Hindu outfits demanding that the sanctity of the temple rituals be protected. On September 28 last year, a five-judge Constitution bench had lifted the ban on the entry of women of menstrual age into the shrine. ",13 Apr 2019,2019-04-13 00:00:00

The struggling carrier has not paid its 17,000-odd employees salaries for March.

The law provides for criminal action against employers and given the fact that Jet Airways has been taken over by bankers, the provisions of law would apply to them, he said. The letter sent by the 19-year old Jet union stated that this violation, apart from being legal violation under the labour law, is also a serious offence of breach of trust as the company was handed over last month by the former chairman Naresh Goyal to the State Bank of India under the Resolution Plan. Earlier in the afternoon, Pawaskar met some officials from the Jet management to discuss the salary non-payment issue. “The salaries cannot be paid till the lenders and bankers release the amount needed to pay the employees.

The parents of students studying in KR Mangalam World School in Greater Kailash II said the fee was increased without consulting them and demanded a rollback. Delhi high court has stayed till April 30 all fee hikes in schools built on land provided by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) or other government agencies. KR Mangalam administrators, however, argued that the school wasn’t built on subsidised government land and the court stay did not “pertain” to the school. In an email, principal Sangeeta Arora said, “Our school has come up on private land. The parents need to appreciate that school fee is the only source of school income. The increasing cost of administration particularly on account of implementation of 7th Central Pay Commission or wage incremental factors like dearness allowance (twice a year), annual increment payable to staff, higher provision for gratuity on account of increase in salary and length of service do necessitate corresponding increase in fees.” A parent retorted, “How can they use the fact about the school being built on private land as a reason not to follow rules? They did not take the consent of the parents before increasing the fee. And they keep on increasing the fees very year. There is no transparency in how they run the institution.” The earlier fees of Rs 36,100 per quarter have gone up to Rs 46,400, including arrears. The parents gathered at the school around 8am and the demonstration ended around 1pm. The school put up resistance, even calling in the police. One parent alleged, “When we reached the reception area, the school administration summoned the teachers and stood them in our way. They then began shouting, ‘Go back parents’.” The school was also accused of switching off the air conditioners in the classrooms during the protests, leaving the children sweltering. The management later clarified, “The allegation of ACs and fans being purposely switched off is baseless. In fact, an MCB developed a problem, which was resolved in 10-15 minutes.” The parents held a meeting till late in the evening and decided to take up the matter with every possible authority. Earlier, on April 10, the parents had submitted a representation to the management pointing out that the institution did not issue the fee bill in the prescribed format and charging the school with not running on “fair administrative practices”.

The frustration was evident during discussions with autorickshaw owners in slums like Rajendra Nagar, Hasanbagh, Pardi, Kalamna and Minimata Nagar. “The government taxes us, but lets app-based taxis operate illegally at our expense,” said Mohammed Shahid of Hasanbagh. Vilas Bhalekar, president of Tiger Autorickshaw Union, the biggest union of autorickshaw owners, confirmed this, “On March 26, we had openly declared support to Congress nominee Nana Patole at a meeting of all members.” “Auto owners were disillusioned with the BJP government for taxing us in last 5 years. In 2014, vehicle insurance was increased from Rs3,600 to Rs7,500, permit fee from Rs200 to Rs10,700, RTO passing fee from Rs200 to Rs600, and hypothecation fee from Rs100 to Rs1,500.

This was reflected during polling, as autorickshaw owners were seen ferrying relatives and families to voting booths in slum areas. “I swear I voted against the BJP.

On April 8, the West Bengal Online Cab Operators Guild had decided to keep ACs in app-cabs switched off for the entire day. “Perhaps, they did not take into account the commuters’ backlash,” said an app cab driver. At various parts of the city, cabbies not only had tiff with commuters, they were forced to turn the ACs on. A few stubborn cabbies, who refused to budge, had a piece of commuters’ mind and worst possible rating, which is a very good excuse for aggregators to block cabbies in the system. A majority of driver-partners refused to toe the diktat of the guild as switching off ACs during the peak hours would be suicidal. “Peak hours are also surge hours. If we charge higher fare and in return switch off the AC , commuters would not spare us and poor ratings would ruin my reputation, which I have built over last five years,” said Shankar Pal, an app-cab driver. This is why on the second day, the guild was forced to confine the agitation to non-peak hours —1pm to 5pm. “Any agitation needs solid moral and legal footings to sustain itself. The problem is such agitations are misdirected and legally untenable. App-cabbies cannot do anything that violates the agreement they have with the aggregators. Secondly, the dynamic pricing is the hall-mark of these app-cab services, which follows market economy. If the supply exceeds demand, fare will be less, if demand exceeds supply, fare is high,” said Arindam Ghosh, a transport economist working on the aggregators’ regime in transportation. In fact, in last couple of days, the aggregators acted promptly against the errant cabbies (who switched off cab AC while carrying passengers), leaving a lot of cabbies out of job. But commuters outrage over “unreasonable behaviour of cabbies” and quarrels that almost led to a scuffle made the guild leaders retreat. In fact, Madan Mitra , a seasoned politician, who is also the president of the Guild, was quick to understand how the agitation was fizzling out before it peaked. On Wednesday, he asked the agitators to soften their stand. As a face-saver, he asked them to confine the agitation to one hour in the afternoon. The agitators were also under pressure as the transport department was sending signals against such agitation. ",11 Apr 2019,2019-04-11 00:00:00

Earlier, Naidu met CEO Gopal Krishna Dwivedi and submitted a memorandum to him, accusing the EC of acting ""on behalf of the YSR Congress under the guidance of the BJP"".

He denounced the ""autocratic and partisan attitude"" of the EC in handling election-related matters pertaining to the state.

Further, the chief minister noted that ever since the polls were announced and the Model Code of Conduct came into force, the Income Tax authorities had only been targeting the TDP candidates, workers and sympathisers. ""This is, thus, creating an atmosphere of fear and terror and not only violating the Model Code of Conduct, but also disturbing the level-playing field,"" he said in the memorandum. None of the candidates belonging to other political parties had been targeted, projecting a message that the TDP candidates and sympathisers alone were the culprits, Naidu added.

On Tuesday, locals planted paddy saplings as a mark of protest on the Transit Camp link road from Kichha bypass to highlight its poor condition. The unprecedented protest did not just end there the residents of the area have taken it to the social media by uploading photographs and videos on internet. The local residents, led by former Congress minister, Tilak Raj Behar, planted the saplings on the slushy road. Behar condemned the alleged indifferent attitude of district administration and the local BJP legislator Rajkumar Thukral in repairing the road. He said that MLA Thukral has publicly said that he has written to the Chief Minister 22 times to get this road constructed all over again. ""If an MLA can not get one km stretch of a road built by his own ruling party, he should resign. This road caters to more than fifty thousand commuters everyday but the long standing problem has not been addressed by the concerned leaders and authorities for more than two years"", added Behar. “We have been giving memorandums to district administration for the last two years to repair the road,” said Monu Nishd, corporator of the area. However, according to him, the authorities concerned have failed to develop the road and the pathetic condition of the road has made travelling a nightmare. “This is a silent protest to seek answers from the administration and the local legislator. If we had blocked the road instead, it would have only added to the problems of public,” Parimal Roy a resident said. Residents said the rainwater gets accumulated on the one km stretch of the dilapidated road making it impossible to walk. “Because of the poor road condition, its impossible to walk on the road let alone be driving cars or bikes,” said Shankar Goldar, a resident of Raja colony located on the this stretch.

Meanwhile, Sivakumar, who suffered a hip fracture in an accident while digging a farm well, was undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Chennai for more than a month.

These doctors, most of them well-known private practitioners and owners of private hospitals in the city, were expressing their support to MBBS graduate aspirants of general (open) category. After implementation of quota for socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC — popularly known as Maratha reservation) and economically weaker sections (EWS) in PG seats, students of open category are left with a very few seats in government and private PG medical colleges. Students have been protesting the “faulty implementation” of these two quotas in PG seats from April 2. On Tuesday, professionals also came to their support and demanded that PG admissions should be done on merit basis. “This type of implementation of quota is injustice with meritorious students of open category. These MBBS students have worked hard and secured good ranks in PG-NEET. Due to less number of seats, many meritorious students will be deprived of the PG admissions. This will also hit the quality of health care in future,” said ophthalmologist Dr Anil Laddhad. Doctors attached to Indian Medical Association (IMA) and its bodies brought placards that had ‘Save Merit, Save India’, ‘Merit deprived, nation destroyed’ among other messages. Other students also joined them later in the protest and they decided to escalate it further in the state. “On April 14, there will be a candle march in Mumbai. On birth anniversary of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, medical students will be raising the issue of wrong implementation of reservation. In Nagpur too, we are planning to hold such an event,” said Dr Laddhad. Doctors had earlier planned a silent march from Lokmat Square. But police refused them the permission of holding the march. “Dhantoli cops told us to skip the foot march. They permitted us a small public meeting near Dhantoli garden. It was totally non-political event,” said Dr Rajendra Chandak of IMA. The doctors claimed that the issue is not political. “We are not against reservation but no student of any category should face injustice,” he said. The doctors who joined the agitation said that the MBBS degree in itself is a great equalizer and it is unfair to pit one doctor against another on the basis of ‘social and educational backwardness’. They demanded that reservation at PG level should be implemented in a different manner. ",09 Apr 2019,2019-04-09 00:00:00

Quoting Delhi high court stay on fee hike , parents staged a demonstration claiming that the school was violating the rule and law. On Monday, wearing caps with a message “rollback fee hike”, the parents from St George’s School, Alaknanda, alleged that the high court has extended the stay till April 30 and prohibited schools from increasing the fee. “This is a school built on a government land, how can they increase the fees? It is just unbelievable that the fee has been increased from around Rs 55,000 to Rs 1,21,000, including the arrears. How can one pay so much money? All the charges have been increased. This was done all of a sudden without consultation,” said a parent. Parents put banners which said “paisa nahin duayen lo”, “take back fee hike” and have submitted a memorandum to the school. They have also submitted a complaint to the officials in the education department. “At first, they even refused to accept our memorandum, and then after waiting for so long, they finally accepted it. When the last PTM was held, we were only told about an increase of around Rs10,000,” said another parent. The school officials, however, did not respond to TOI’s calls and email. Meanwhile, deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia congratulated the parents. “You all have chosen an honest government, and by no means will we allow private schools to increase fees arbitrarily,” Sisodia tweeted. Some of the parents were informed by the school that the high court rule does not apply to them, as they are a “minority school”. However, Khagesh Jha, advocate and member of Justice for All, who is representing the parents, said this order applies to all schools. “This interim order is applicable for minority schools as well.

They also cannot charge the increased fees,” said Jha. Now, the parents are worried as the time given to pay the fees is approaching April 10. A senior official in Directorate of Education (DoE) said the school has been asked to rollback the fees. “The school cannot increase the fees without getting their accounts checked by DoE . We have asked the school to rollback. If they don’t comply, we will issue a notice,” said the official. ",09 Apr 2019,2019-04-09 00:00:00

They dared politicians to ask for votes and have rotten tomatoes and eggs thrown at them. Later, area councillor Jaspal Singh Giaspura and MC officials assured the residents of solving their problems to and asked them to end their protest. Abhimanyu Mishra, a resident, rued that for the past five years they have been struggling with contaminated water supply and choked sewerage in the locality and despite numerous complaints the problem still remains. He complained that the situation had gone worse in the last two months, which forced them to stage a protest. Another resident of the area, Shivam Kumar, said, “The main road of the area remains submerged in filthy sewerage water due to which school children and commuters face a tough time crossing it. The uncovered manholes pose a great risk as their presence can’t be judged for water is all around.” He added they will not vote for any party as none of the leaders was taking their problems seriously. The area councillor, however, said he was unable to understand why residents started the protest when they had already kicked off the cleaning works of the main sewerage line. “Due to the cleaning of main sewerage line through super suction machines, the inner drains were blocked temporarily and led to water stagnation. In response to the issue, zonal commissioner J S Sekhon said, “The sewerage water diverted due to super suction cleaning created blockage in the area, but only temporarily. We have installed a machine to clear the stagnant water from the road. The situation will improve as soon as the cleaning works are completed.” ",08 Apr 2019,2019-04-08 00:00:00

An online petition was also shared and a candlelight march is planned on Carter Road on Sunday evening. A student of the Lokmanya Tilak Medical College said: “The government, to satisfy vote banks prior to polls, added the new categories of Maratha and economically backward class in the existing biased quota system.” . Only 4% seats in the state are available for general, unreserved people applying through the state quota, added another. “Candidates having ranks as high as SML (state merit list) 80 are not getting post-graduate seats of their choice. The future is bleak for students and for the healthcare sector,” said a parent. The petition, which has almost reached its target of 25,000 signatories, stated: “Providing reserved seats to students with socio-economically poor background is justified only till graduation. They are no more backward once they become doctors. Everyone deserves a fair chance to prepare and compete for the PG seat they want, and reservation takes that away from them.” It added, “A minimum of 50% of seats have been taken away from deserving candidates in PG institutes in all states. Nowadays, as soon as an election year comes up, governments indulge in vote bank politics, making it even more difficult for a doctor to survive in this nation.” The petition stated, “In 2019 the Maharashtra government increased reservations to a staggering 81%. Now, a candidate with 5,000 rank will not be able to take admission to the branch of his choice, but a student belonging to a reserved category with 70,000 rank will easily secure a seat.” ",09 Apr 2019,2019-04-09 00:00:00

In an interesting choice, the party named Diya Kumari , scion of the former Jaipur royal family, for the Rajsamand seat in the Lok Sabha. In doing so, it has ignored strained equations the former Jaipur royals share with ex-CM Vasundhara Raje. This is the second instance of the brass taking calls which Raje may not be comfortable with. Early on, it reached out to saffron rebel Hanuman Beniwal , who had quit the party in protest against Raje’s unquestioned dominance. BJP is backing Beniwal’s candidature for the Nagore seat as an independent. Diya’s choice for Mewar seat raised eyebrows because Rajputs of the area have not been fond of her family since the days of their challenge to Mughal emperor Akbar. The then rulers of Jaipur chose to side with the Mughals, a call seen by Mewar Rajputs as treason. The surprise choice whetted the speculation about the party opting for a hardline Hindutva figure for the Bhopal seat to engage Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh in what could turn out to be mouth-watering clash of ideologies. Singh was at the forefront of the campaign against “Hindutva terror”, raised doubts about the identity of those who attacked Mumbai on 26/11 while passionately insisting that the Indian Mujahideen terrorists killed in a gunbattle with Delhi Police at Batla House were killed in a “fake encounter”. While Diya’s entry was facilitated by sitting member Hariom Singh Rathore’s decision to opt out because of health reasons, Banda MP Bhairon Prasad Mishra has been replaced with R K Patel despite astubborn resistance from the incumbent. The change had become necessary after Shyama Prasad Gupta entered the fray on an SP ticket, disrupting caste equations. Mishra responded to the leadership’s firmness by resorting to dharna, but to no avail. Gupta switched to SP amid indications that BJP was set to drop him. Union minister Uma Bharati, who has decided not to defend her Jhansi seat because of health issues, has been replaced by Anurag Sharma of the Baidyanath Group, a well-known name for ayurveda medicines. Sharma’s father Vishwanath Sharma has been a BJP leader. Party veteran Ram Tahal Chaudhary has to make way for Sanjay Seth for the Ranchi seat. Chaudhary, a known Kurmi leader of the state who turned 77 this year, was keen on contesting the seat he comfortably won in 2014. Former Jharkhand minister and sitting MP from Koderma, Ravindra Roy, has been dropped with the party bringing in Annapurna Devi, a recent induction from RJD. Sitting Gwalior MP and Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who has been shifted to neighbouring Morena, has been replaced by Vivek Sejwalkar. For the Barmer seat in Rajasthan, the party has chosen Kailash Chaudhary at the expense of sitting member Colonel Sonaram Chaudhary (retd). The retired army official had lost the recent assembly polls, a possible reason why he had to face the axe. In 2014, the party had defied protests from its veteran leader Jaswant Singh to field Sonaram, leading the former to contest as an Independent. The saffron party is yet to announce candidates from several key constituencies including Gorakhpur, Deoria, Bhadohi, Jaunpur, Ghosi and Bhopal. Diya Kumari had won the assembly polls on the BJP symbol in 2013 from Sawai Madhopur but did not contest the recent state polls.

The government has ordered the closure of the Jammu-Srinagar highway for all kinds of civilian traffic from Udhampur to Baramulla every Sunday and Wednesday in order to facilitate movement of security forces for Lok Sabha election duty. It will remain effective till May 31. National Conference president Farooq Abdullah has demanded the immediate roll back of the restrictions, while PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti termed the government's decision as ""wrong"". The decision came in the aftermath of the February 14 terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy on the highway in Pulwama district . Forty CRPF personnel were killed. On March 30, another attempt was made to target a CRPF convoy with a car bomb on the highway near Banihal in Ramban district. NC leaders led by Abdullah took out a march at Athwajan on the highway to protest the ban imposed by the government. ""This is a wrong order. They should use train service for the movement of the security force personnel or they can move them at night so that people do not have to suffer,”the NC president said. ""It is our demand that this order be revoked. It sounds like dictatorship,"" Abdullah added. Former chief minister Omar Abdullah also slammed the authorities over the ban order, terming it ""mindless"". ""Driving to Uri I'm getting to see first hand the extent of disruption and inconvenience that is being caused to people because of the mindless highway closure order that is in place today,"" Abdullah tweeted.

The former chief minister said her party will go to court against the ban order. ""Kashmir belongs to Kashmiris . That they will have to seek permission to use their own roads, we will not allow this to happen. I appeal to people to defy this ban,"" she said. Later, Mehbooba took to Twitter saying she will not allow Kashmiris to be imprisoned in their own land. ""Protested against Guv admins callous & absurd ban today.

The elaborate arrangements made by administration for convenience of the people on the highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir with the rest of the country, during the restricted travel period was quite successful on the first day of the traffic prohibition, an official release said.

Its members said that despite the significance of this Act for the communities in Himachal Pradesh whose livelihoods are dependent upon agricultural and livestock rearing, the state government and bureaucracy have both failed to implement this Act efficiently on the ground. They demanded revision of FRA claims of people in Mandi after proper dissemination of information among people and training regharding which they alleged that entire Mandi district has been declared zero/nil-claims by the district administration machinery and is now being replicated in other districts of the state as well. TOI made repeated calls and texted message to head of forest force, Himachal Pradesh, Ajay Kumar for his version on the issue, but he did not respond. According to Shyam Singh Chauhan, member of the organisation, “Only 129 claims have been recorded by the state ever since the Act came into being in 2006. Such indolence in the implementation of this act has continued because of misunderstandings and doubts about the Act among the concerned authorities and bureaucracy as well as due to lack of any technical training for the line officials. So we demand that the governments must provide proper information and organise trainings for all the members of Forest Rights Committees, and concerned line departments (Revenue, Forest and Panchayati Raj), so that a time-bound and in informed decision can be taken on the matter.” The Forest Rights Act was passed by Parliament in 2006, with the aim of protecting the interests as well as providing legal recognition and recording the rights of the communities dependent on forest land for their bonafide livelihood needs. Pawna Kumar, another member, said that in 2014, in order to ease out forest land diversion for development activities, all Forest Rights Committees (FRC) and gram sabhas in the entire Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh have been made to pass 'nil certificates' through the panchayat secretaries, therefore declaring that the people of the entire district do not have any forest rights or claims under the mentioned act. Manshi Asher, activist and member, said that the district administrative officers are now replicating the same model of Mandi in other districts as well. “A similar approach has been carried out in the district of Chamba whereas in Kangra district, the bureaucracy is on the drive of collecting similar nil certificates by putting a timeline of 90 days for FRA claim collection. This is impossible to achieve when people have no idea about the provisions of the Act itself,” she said, adding that in reality not just in the district of Mandi but in the entire state more than lakhs of families have held the forest land under occupation since much before the cut off date of December 13, 2005 prescribed under the Act for the purpose of agriculture and day-to-day living. “These families have been facing the threat of eviction and living in insecurity and it is only under the FRA 2006 that they can claim individual rights for the occupied land and ensure their livelihoods. These lakhs of forest dependent households that rely on forest land for fuel wood, timber, fodder, streams, herbal medicines, stone and sand etc., are also eligible to claim for community rights over the same under this act,” she explained.

Venezuelans protest as Guaido declares 'definitive' escalation,Venezuelans protest as Guaido declares 'definitive' escalation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/venezuelans-protest-as-guaido-declares-definitive-escalation/articleshow/68760866.cms,en,"CARACAS: Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido on Saturday launched what he promised will be a ""definitive"" escalation of pressure to force the country's embattled leftist leader from office. Addressing a giant anti-government rally in Caracas , Guaido — whose claim to be interim president is supported by around 50 nations — kicked off what he called ""Operation Liberty,"" his plan to oust President Nicolas Maduro. ""Everyone to the streets, let's start the final phase of the end of the usurpation!"" he told supporters, speaking from the back of a pickup truck. He called for a huge nationwide turnout on Wednesday, and urged his followers to redouble their efforts to maintain pressure in the streets. ""The greatest escalation of pressure we have seen in our history"" has begun, Guaido said. The call comes amid massive blackouts and the collapse of water supplies affecting the nation, further exacerbated a growing political crisis. The United States meanwhile has stiffened its economic sanctions against Maduro, and one top US official warned Venezuela 's military that it must protect the rights of peaceful protesters. At the rally, Guaido also warned Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel that the supply of subsidized Venezuelan oil to the Caribbean communist island nation was over. Venezuela has been sending cheap oil to Cuba in exchange for labor from Cuban doctors and teachers, but Guaido said the oil was actually financing a Cuban intelligence group known as G2 that was cracking down on Maduro opponents in the Venezuelan military. ""The exploitation of Venezuelan oil is over, so Mr Diaz-Canel... Venezuelan oil will not be used to submit and investigate our military officials"" through the G2, he told the crowd. Pro-Guaido protests drew thousands in rallies across the country on Saturday. A pro-Maduro counter-demonstration in Caracas, with supporters dressed in red, drew a large crowd that gathered at the Miraflores presidential palace. ""Together, permanently mobilized, let's keep defending national peace and independence; no more interference!"" Maduro tweeted. Later, he called upon Mexico and Uruguay to relaunch their proposal for dialogue to resolve the crisis without foreign intervention. The two countries had first introduced that idea in January. Two opposition deputies were detained at an anti-government demo in the western city of Maracaibo, but a few hours later Guaido announced that the two had been released. Elimar Diaz, a lawmaker who marched in Maracaibo, told AFP the protest there had encountered ""brutal repression,"" including tear gas canisters dropped from helicopters, the use of National Guard armored vehicles and attacks by members of the pro-government militia, known as ""colectivos."" Diaz said people in Maracaibo had gone ""days without electricity"" amid ""inhumane rationing"" by the government. Maduro has blamed US-backed sabotage for the massive blackouts that have deprived millions of power. The opposition blames a failure to maintain critical infrastructure. Facing intense pressure at home and abroad, the Maduro government has sought to weaken Guaido. The government has stripped his parliamentary immunity, authorized his prosecution for proclaiming himself acting president, and banned him from holding public office for 15 years. Guaido said earlier this week he feared that he could be abducted by government agents. Speaking to the pro-government Constitutional Assembly, Maduro's top lieutenant Diosdado Cabello slammed the US point man on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, as an ""assassin."" ""It is Abrams who should be in prison, condemned in the United States for genocide in Central America,"" said Cabello, referring to the US official's controversial role in the Central American conflicts of the 1980s. Washington meanwhile kept up the international pressure on Maduro to step down. Vice President Mike Pence on Friday announced fresh sanctions against 34 vessels belonging to Venezuela's state oil company and two companies that ship crude to Cuba. ""This is only a first step,"" US national security advisor John Bolton tweeted on Saturday in reference to the sanctions. He cautioned the Venezuelan defense minister in a separate tweet of the official's ""constitutional responsibility to protect innocent civilians who are peacefully demonstrating,"" adding: ""Do not let the Cubans or the 'colectivos' inflict violence against Venezuelan patriots."" Maduro is supported by the Venezuelan military, China and Russia. Washington and its allies view the socialist president as illegitimate since he took office in January for a second term following elections widely seen as deeply flawed. Washington has convened a UN Security Council for Wednesday to discuss the Venezuelan crisis. Since Venezuela's massive blackout of March 7, the country has been subject to repeated power cuts, with electricity being rationed outside of Caracas. The blackouts have knocked out water supplies as well as transport and communications, forcing many people to trim their work days to six hours. ",07 Apr 2019,2019-04-07 00:00:00

On Saturday too, several parents staged protests outside DAV Public School in Rajrappa against arbitrary hike in fees ahead of the commencement of the new academic session. A group of parents also demonstrated outside the office of the general manager of Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) since morning, claiming that they are being forced to buy books and uniforms from schools against the norms. CCL (Ramgarh division) funds the operations of DAV Public School, Rajrappa. Gopal Chaudhary, one of the parents leading the protest, claimed that DAV Public School has hiked its tuition fee by more than 40% and is collecting annual capitation fee in the name of annual development fund. “This is against the directives of the government as well as the norms of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE),” he said, adding, “Some of the other private schools in the district are also resorting to such tactics.” Chaudhary said their protests will continue till the school management rolls back the hike. H K Jha, principal of DAV Public School in Rajrappa, admitted that the school has increased its tuition fee but refuted the allegations of any violation of government norms. “The hike is for the annual development of the school and facilities that we provide. I don’t think it is any violation of government directives,” he said. Raja Ram Sahu, district superintendent of education (DSE), didn’t wish to comment on this particular issue. He, however, said owing to growing protests by parents he has issued directives to all the private schools under their jurisdiction, warning them to cancellation of their affiliation if the hike is found to be unjustified or arbitrary. “On the orders of the deputy commissioner we have sent letters to all schools in this regard. The state government gives affiliations to schools from LKG to Class VIII while boards such as CBSE and ICSE provides affiliations to schools from Class IX till XII,” Sahu said, adding, “We have sought reports from all schools from Classes I to VIII with details of facilities, infrastructure and fee structure etc. Once we get the reports we will take action if we find any cases of violations by such schools,” he said.

It was Bhattacharya who had offered the outfit members legal help when it had led the land protest against the power grid project in Bhangar. The Committee on Friday organised the meeting on the Bhangar’s Shyamnagar Primary School ground, where CPI(ML) Red Star leader Aleek Chakrabarty and Bhattacharya were among the speakers. A day earlier, at a Trinamool gathering, Bhangar strongman Arabul had announced he would not allow the CPI(ML) leader to enter his birthplace. Even as supporters started heading for the Shyamnagar meeting on Friday, Arabul and his associates arrived in a car and parked it across the road around 4.30pm. “He started browbeating the participants and abused women,” said rally organiser Sharmistha Choudhury. But the women, followed by others, rushed towards him and shoved him out of the way. Arabul later claimed he was on the spot, returning home. “People with lathis led an attack on me. My security saved me. They damaged my car. I am going to the police station to lodge a complaint,” he said. Shortly, Arabul loyalists assembled at Shyamnagar and later at Natun Hat More and blocked the road for about two hours. Arabul and his son Hakimul were part of the demonstration.

Some political parties too joined the protesters and raised slogans against the Chandigarh administration and municipal corporation. Congress leader Bhupinder Badheri said liquor vend is close to a school and temple and the authorities should not have allowed its opening at the site. The administration should consider the genuine demands of the villagers instead of only worrying about generating revenue, he added. Local area councillor Satish Kainth said even the allotment of site to the liquor vend is questionable. “The shop where the liquor vend has been opened belonged to the Chandigarh municipal corporation. The shop was rented out to a person and as per the rules, he can’t sublet the shop to anyone else. However, there has been a clear vioaltion of the rule in this case.” He along with villagers have lodged a complaint in this regard to MC, following which the civic body has formed a committee to look into the matter, he added. Meanwhile, Gurinder Singh, a villager, said a few days ago, the authorities had closed down the liquor vend but it was opened again on Friday. “We only want that the liquor vend should be immediately shifted away from the village entrance,” he added. Requesting anonymity, a senior MC official said they have formed a committee and are looking into the matter. ",06 Apr 2019,2019-04-06 00:00:00

In fact, it is not just the political parties which have pushed the issue of illegal sand mining to the backburner, even the protesters seem to have forgotten it. Both the AIADMK and DMK have consciously left out the issue from their election manifesto. Ever since the Madurai bench of Madras high court clamped a ban on sand mining and quarries across Cauvery, Kollidam, Thamirabarani, Palar and Amaravathi rivers were shut in August 2018, illegal mining has been thriving with the support of influential people. The anti-social elements now target small rivers in the area as is evident from the cases registered in Trichy region in the past seven months. Curiously enough, the farmers’ associations and activists who had staged protests against the illegal sand mining saying it led to depletion of ground water are now silent. Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam district president M P Chinnadurai pointed out the failure of the farmers’ associations to rake up the issue during the election. “Our focus is restricted to agriculture loan waiver. The sand mining issue should have been on top of our demands,” he said adding that the mysterious disappearance of environmental activist S Mugilan also may have prevented others from taking up the issue. The protests by activists and farmers were spurred mainly by the excess sand that was being extracted from the rivers. Sustainable sand mining guidelines 2016 say the mining depth should be restricted to 3 metres and the distance from the bank 3 metres or 10 % of the river width whichever was less. However, the miners cared two hoots for it and violated the norms. The negative impact of the decades-long exploitation of the rivers by the sand miners still keeps the people in several areas along the Cauvery, Kollidam rivers running from pillar to post for drinking water. There were times when loading of sand from the quarries was round-the-clock. The regular movement of about 1,000 sand-laden heavy vehicles every day also posed serious threat to lives and caused damage to roads. Tamil Desa Makkal Munnani state committee member advocate J Kennedy who fought the plundering of river sand in the delta region said, “None of the parties have any idea about an eco-friendly environment. In the context of crony capitalism, there is no bond or bondage with nature,” he said. One of the co-ordinators of Cauvery River Protection Movement S Vijayan, a close associate of Mugilan, pointed out that PMK which raised the pitch against sand mining was on the side of AIADMK for electoral gains. Trichy district secretary of the pro-CPI Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam Ayilai Siva Suriyan said, “The two regimes of AIADMK government destroyed the major portion of the rivers through indiscriminate sand mining. As an ally, we will demand that the DMK regulate sand mining if they come to power,” he said. ",05 Apr 2019,2019-04-05 00:00:00

Lau Satu Gaonkar, 57, from Sonal told TOI, “Every year, bees build their hives on the boulders locally known as Mhovacho Guno, which sit on the bank of the Mhadei. These stones hold historic and cultural significance and we never touch or harm the hives. We have never experienced a bee attack.” However, Tuesday’s incident was the result of unruly behaviour on the part of some visitors.

Locals said visitors should exercise caution and not get too adventurous, especially in wild hinterlands like this. Earlier, several picnickers had drowned in the river, and locals added that visitors get carried away by the silent waters and fail to factor presence of currents. ",05 Apr 2019,2019-04-05 00:00:00

A meeting of environmentalists held here on Thursday decided to conduct a joint and long-standing protest against Kochi corporation's Padmasarovaram, a cycle track and walkway project, and a bund constructed by Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) across Kaniyampuzha River at Chambakkara. The meeting also decided to carry out campaigns for creating awareness among the public about the damages caused by Padmasarovaram and the bund across Kaniyampuzha. ""We have decided to carryout protests against the two projects. Padmasarovaram project is being implemented violating coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms. A bund was constructed across Chilavannoor backwaters for facilitating the construction of a viaduct as part of the project. No approvals, including that from Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA), has been secured for constructing the bund as well as the viaduct across the backwaters,"" said environmentalist and state convener of AAP C R Neelakandan. ""Same is the case with the bund constructed by KMRL across Kaniyampuzha. It was constructed three years ago for facilitating the construction of Metro pillars. Though KMRL authorities had promised to demolish it once the pillars were constructed, they didn't keep their word,"" he said. Environmentalists will start an agitation demanding implementation of Padmasarovaram project as per its original design. Had the project been implemented as per the original design, Padmasarovaram would have come up on the marshy land off the backwaters. Then, it would not have affected the backwaters. ""But authorities changed the design. The original project was more eco-friendly. So, we have decided to start an agitation demanding that the project should be implemented in its original design. Though we had applied before the Kochi corporation seeking a copy of the original design of Padmasarovaram, they failed to provide it. But we have secured the original design through other means,"" said RTI activist K T Cheshire. There are allegations that the bund was being constructed across Chilavannoor backwaters for helping land mafia who possess holdings near the backwaters. The flow of water through both Chilavannoor backwaters and Kaniyampuzha river has been affected due to the construction of the bunds. Meanwhile, Cheshire has filed a complaint with ombudsman for local bodies seeking measures to stop implementation of Padmasarovaram project based on the revised design.

Following the Supreme Court order against the reclamation, around 50 cents which was reclaimed by the firm had been taken over by the corporation. Rather than removing the mud and debris and restoring the levelled land, corporation authorities are being constructing the park. This is to help the private builder,"" Cheshire said.

This delayed train services during morning peak hours along the Karjat/Kasara - CSMT corridor and affected travel during peak hours early morning. Sources said that a few women commuters had also complained that whenever they managed to enter the compartment of a fast train from Diva, they found it difficult to get a seat as there were “groups” which only allowed their own members to occupy seats. Central Railway’s senior public relations officer, Anil Kumar Jain, said that not a single train had been cancelled due to the incident and services were gradually restored to the normal schedule. The railway authorities are however not happy with the protest incident due to which the train was detained between 7.10am and 7.18am, and this led to bunching of other trains. Sources said that the women had first approached the motorman with a verbal complaint that those standing at the door of the ladies compartments were not allowing anyone to board. There was an altercation between two groups of women commuters after which those who were standing on the platform went on the tracks to stop the movement of train, the sources added. A video of the incident went viral on social media and brought back memories of January 2015 when Diva had witnessed a flash rail roko which led to violent protests. The commuters had then protested spontaneously after watching several fast trains go by and no train stopping at their station, and said they were being “neglected” as there has been a longstanding demand for locals originating from and terminating at Diva. “Following this protest, we had ensured that fast trains stop at Diva. But now, even after providing the fast train service, there is a new problem of train bullies . Whatever the problem, the women have no right to stop trains,” said a senior official. He added that it is unwarranted as trains are the lifeline for lakhs of daily commuters and if you stop one train, it disturbs the frequency of other trains during peak hour rush. He said that the women could have complained to the railway police or RPF officials or the station master about the trouble, and got the train bullies booked. “Rail roko is completely uncalled for,” he said.

As 16% of SEBC cannot be implemented in management and NRI quota of private colleges, the government has added this number to the state quota, which has increased SEBC quota to nearly 30%, eventually leaving only 37 seats for general category students in private medical colleges. Dr TP Lahane, Director of Medical Education and Research, Maharashtra state, said general category students should go for seats of management quota in private medical colleges. “It’s a fact that only 37 seats are available for general category students in private colleges. We had no option but to implement the reservation as the high court has directed the same. However, we have deliberately kept the management quota and NRI quota out of any reservation. All 215 seats are available for general category students,” he said. However, fees in management and NRI quota is three to five times higher than the state quota seats, so this suggestion has left the protesting students angry. ISSUE AT A GLANCE UNTIL NOW: Reservation limited to 52% in Maharashtra NOW: Reservation rises to 78% after including SEBC and EWS quota EWS Reservation: 10 % EWS reservation introduced in Feb 2019 by central government and hastily implemented in Maharashtra within months, despite assurances from the centre about proportionate (25%) increment in seats soon SEBC reservation: 16% SEBC reservation (Maratha reservation) introduced on November 30, 2018, by state government and implemented in this session. Doctors claim this is against the SEBC Act, which says “new reservation shall not be implemented after commencement of admission procedure, which includes commencement of registration for the entrance exam for admission”. NEET-PG registration began on November 2, 2018, almost a month before SEBC was announced Can MBBS doctor be educationally backward?

Ruing that students in this tribal heartland are unable to pursue their academic aspirations, the protesters demanded that all political parties fielding their candidates must include provisions to improve the education system in the area in their election manifestos. The students started the lockdown around 10am and continued till afternoon. During their protest, the students prevented entry of both teaching and non-teaching staff inside the campus. Those who entered before the protest were not allowed to come out. The students’ union president, Kunal Sharma, said, “We are forced to take this step today as all our earlier pleas to the authorities concerned fell on deaf ears. We want this as an election issue.” The college, affiliated to Ranchi University, has 14,000 students and needs 100 teachers. But barely half the strength exist. The students alleged that notwithstanding the staff crunch, the varsity is arbitrarily transferring existing teachers to Ranchi, creating further problems in their regular classes. Sharma added, “To tackle the manpower crunch, the college appointed contractual tutors but many of them left the job due to non payment or delay in their salaries and lack of job security.” Other students said there posts for biology and mathematics teachers have been vacant for several months. Similarly, there is only teacher for botany while physics and chemistry departments are run by one teacher each. The college’s head of department for chemistry, P K Keshri, admitted that the college is facing staff crunch. He said, “The science faculty is badly hit by the faculty crunch.” Professor of the economics department, Amitabh Bharti, also said, “The college requires 100 teachers but there are only 54 now. Conducting classes is becoming difficult with this strength.” Sources said since 2008, no regular appointments have been made in the college and they have to depend on contractual staff. “No one wants to work in this rural area. Even those who join, leave for greener pastures,” Keshri added. The college’s principal, Jitbahan Baraik, said they had apprised the varsity of the problems long back and have demanded appointment of teaching staff. ",02 Apr 2019,2019-04-02 00:00:00

They also raised slogans against board chairman Anand Kishor. The results of the Inter exams were announced on Saturday. While many protesters claimed they were given negative marks in theory papers, others pointed out errors in the tabulation of marks. Shashi Kumar Suman from Purnia told this newspaper, “I had taken all the exams, but my mathematics score was missing from my marksheet.” Junaid Khan from Saran was equally disappointed. He said, “I scored 59 in physics , 70 in chemistry, 42 in biology , 58 in English and 62 in NRB Hindi-MB English. However, my results state that I have failed in the Inter exams.” Another candidate Adarsh Kumar Azad, a student of B D College-Patna, was allotted negative marks in Hindi, physics and chemistry. “I got -1 in three papers. How is that possible?” he asked. When BSEB officials verified the marksheets of some students, it was found that they were different from those available on the board’s official website. Kishor told this newspaper, “The protesters must have downloaded their results from fake websites. We have already told students to visit www.biharboardonline.in, www.biharboardonline.gov.in and www.bsebinteredu.in for results.

Over 200 locals gathered from early morning at the new liquor establishment at Malviya Nagar. Printouts stating -'No voting if the liquor shop opens' - were stuck on shops in the area by the protesters. They also stuck the posters on some autorickshaws parked there. ""Location of the liquor shop has been declared by the district administration. We identified this location (at Roshanpura) by the interior furnishings work being conducted. There is a school nearby. Besides, the Durga Puja pandal is placed at this very spot where the liquor shop is to open. It is an unacceptable situation,"" said former corporator, Waheed Laskari. The location allotted to the store is about 500 metres from the current location, he added. By 8 am, elected representatives from both the Congress and BJP came out in support of the women. Congress corporator from nearby ward (Shymala Hills area) Sabista Zaki said, ""No liquor store can be at 500-metres of a densely populated residential area. The main road traffic would be affected and also lead to a law and order issue."" When asked how the ruling party allowed such a move in the first place, local Congress leader Asif Zaki replied that the government had only permitted the tendering process; locations had to be decided later. From April 1, new excise allocations come into effect. Alka, a resident of the area, was furious with the idea of a liquor store in the vicinity. ""The ease of access would mean that slumdwellers would consume more alcohol. It would impact our families and children,"" she said. Area SDM Sanjay Shrivastava, who reached the spot, assured that the location had not been decided. ""The process of allocation of excise permits is still on-going,"" he said. Roshanpura has a densely populated slum. The votebank is crucial for candidates in the upcoming elections, said a local leader. Sources said that local MLA and state minister, PC Sharma, has stated that the matter would be reviewed. Protesters have also lodged a complaint in this regard with the state election commissioner.

A protesting student said the limited meal came for Rs 32 and contained four chapatis, rice, two curries and one sookhi sabji. “Since it is a limited thali, we do not get any extra serving. I wonder what is bothering the university if we share the food among friends. The university regulation means either we finish the food or throw it as sharing is prohibited. I wonder what’s the logic behind the move,” he said. Another student opposed the discontinuation of guest ‘thali’ facility at the refectory. “Earlier, students who did not wish to enrol for monthly mess facility could pay Rs 40 for a meal at the refectory. Now, that facility has also been discontinued,” he said. The students also opposed the removal of television from the mess. “The authorities have removed the television and put a radio instead in the mess. This radio is being used to force us to hear programmes like ‘Man ki Baat’ with the university vice-chancellor. This is an university and we have every right to watch the news,” a student said. A glass frame on the refectory door broke during the agitation. When asked about it, a students said, “It broken during a scuffle between the security guards and students. Blaming just the students is wrong. It was just a student agitation against the dictatorial policies of the vice-chancellor.” A statement issued by the assistant registrar of SPPU Rajesh Raherkar stated that 850 students were enrolled for monthly mess facility, which was way more than the capacity of 750 members. “Hence, from April 1, it was decided to serve the mess facility only to regular subscribers of the mess facility at the refractory for convenience of the students,” it read. Following the protest by the students, the university issued a statement stating that only the students who have enrolled for the mess facility would be served food at the refectory. “Rest of the students can have food at the hostel buildings number 8 and 9. Women students can utilise the facility at their hostels apart from the three canteens located within the campus. The decision has been taken to provide good services to the students and they must cooperate. If there are any objections, the students must submit them formally to the food committee,” the statement read. The city unit president of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena, Kalpesh Yadav, said the guidelines issued for the refractory should be revoked immediately. “The union will wait for four days. If the university failed to act, we would stage a protest against the rules,” Yadav said. Senior inspector Bhaskar Jadhav on Chatushrungi police station told TOI, “We have booked 12 students of the university for physically abusing the security guard on the university premises.” ",02 Apr 2019,2019-04-02 00:00:00

With this latest protest, Timpany School is again in the news for increasing its fees. Parents were unhappy as there has been no consent from the Parent-Teachers Association before implementing the hike. Though the management assured that it would roll back the increased fee by Friday, it had ignored their promise, said Manmohan Pasari, one of the parents. The agitating parents said the management needed to abide by the guidelines laid down by the ICSE and CBSE boards. Instability in taking a decision and the exorbitant fee hike would hit the future of thousands of students hard, they added. In an appeal to the district collector, the parents requested he address the issue and also control the management. The parents also requested the Board of Education to take action against the management of the school for fleecing the parents. The hunger strike would be continued until the management rolled back its decision, the parents said. ",01 Apr 2019,2019-04-01 00:00:00

The bandh has been announced to protest the proposed Gaya visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in connection with the upcoming parliamentary election. Describing the BJP-led government and Centre as RSS backed communal dispensation of imperialist rulers the Maoists have expressed strong resentment to the incidents of mob lynching in the name of cow protection. Spokesperson of the BRC, Manas told TOI that they have already punished one of the BJP leaders, former MLC Anuj Singh by blowing up his house in Bodhibigha village under Dumaria PS of Gaya district on March 27. ""Singh represents the oppressor ruling class and highly communal mindset of the RSS brigade which has targetted people of religious minority groups including the Muslims and Christians and our action against him will not remain limited to blowing up his house. In the days to come our party along with armed villagers will confiscate his movable and immovable property to distribute it among the villagers,"" he said. The Maoists have described action against Singh as a token of protest against the ""fascist rulers '. Manas said that BJP at Centre has been fooling people in the name of conducting peaceful elections. "" There were a series of attacks on revolutionary forces in Kashmir, Manipur and Assam ever since the government was voted to power but the attacks increased in every form since 2018 when the government launched its secretive mission Samadhan, aiming to mute all voices of rebellion by 2022,"" a letter issued by the BRC read. Manas said the so called idea of peaceful parliamentary election for 17th Lok Sabha is a farce because if the government was so convinced of peoples voluntary participation it wouldn't have deployed CRPF and other armed para military forces. ""These deployments are meant to pull out people from their homes to force them on gun point to cast vote whereas public in general are tired of the system and are voluntarily standing with us to support our call for poll boycott,"" Manas added. The Maoists have said that the Modi government will bear the brunt of bloodbath if the para military forces use undue methods to pull out people for participating in the electoral process.

On Sunday, too, people kept coming in bikes and cars to dump garbage near the railway line, even as the demonstration was under way. ""It was shocking to see people carry bags of garbage on two-wheelers and cars and throw them here.

The protest was preceded by a vigil residents kept at the site for three consecutive nights, during which they found that people from restaurants, hotels and other food joints dumped garbage on the tracks. Residents said the biggest problem was absence of garbage collection in the area. Shamir, a resident, said BBMP does not send its vehicles to lift garbage from doorsteps and other establishments, forcing people to store it indoors. ""The concept of door-to-door garbage collection is missing and we have no choice but to throw garbage outside,"" he added. The problem is acute on 6th and 7th Cross of Munnekolala, where residents have begun throwing garbage in open areas. ""Lack of a proper disposal system is forcing me to throw garbage in open areas.

The CPM leader said Modi's address to announce a feat achieved by scientists during the election campaign was a “gross misuse” of the PM’s office and added that the EC “had confined itself exclusively to the issue of “misuse of official media”. The CPM chief also sought a similar leeway for speeches made by leaders from other national parties, saying that if Modi’s speech was not in violation of the model code, the commission should direct “official media to treat speeches and statements made by leaders of recognised national parties in a similar manner as they treated the Prime Minister's speech”. “Soon after the speech, the PM is on record to claim that he is a ' chowkidar ' not only on land and air but also in outer space . The PM and other leaders of the BJP are actively campaigning saying that this government has shown guts which previous governments did not,” Yechury wrote, pointing out the “larger issue” is that the PM is a candidate in the ensuing election and is using the office of the Prime Minister for “furthering electoral objectives”. “What else does this mean but a gross misuse of the office of the Prime Minister for seeking electoral gains. An announcement of this nature is normally done by senior officers of the establishment like the DRDO Director.

Led by Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, the Congress-JD(S) ruling combine organised a protest in front of the Income Tax department at Bengaluru on Thursday against a statewide crackdown on his partymen and others. Jaitley said that it was unprecedented that the chief minister of a state joined the street protest against income tax searches with a political motivation. ""The disproportionality of the reaction of the Congress and the JDS raises a needle of suspicion. Was the minister's nephew a PWD contractor to whom largesses have been given – a case of nepotism? The CM and the ministers who joined the protest need to answer these questions,"" Jaitley said. Even as the JDS and Congress leaders in the state alleged that ministers had been searched, the best evidence they could provide for was that the ‘nephew' of a minister was searched, Jaitley said, adding that even the tax authorities have issued a statement saying that no MP, MLA or minister was searched. Questioning whether states' attitude is threat to federalism, Jaitley said federalism is not merely the rights of the states. Indian federalism entails India as a “union of states”. ""The rights of the union are equally important. Security of India, sovereignty, dealing with terrorism, managing the borders, custom check points, income tax enforcement are all amongst the several constitutional powers of the union. ""If the states stand in way of any of them it is guilty of breaching federal norms. Can a state barge its police into the customs area and direct the customs as to what is to be done? This would be a threat to federalism,"" he said. Jaitley said many states have stopped giving police security to income tax authorities when they conduct their operations. ""Alternatively, when state police is asked for, the information is leaked out to the political government and it reaches the targets of the operations. Tax authorities increasingly have to rely on central forces. In the Kashmir valley recently, searches were conducted under the governor's rule after 17 years. These taxes are meant for the welfare of the poor in India,"" he added. ",30 Mar 2019,2019-03-30 00:00:00
Maoists urge villagers to boycott election to protest ‘militarisation’,Maoists urge villagers to boycott election to protest ‘militarisation’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/maoists-urge-villagers-to-boycott-election-to-protest-militarisation/articleshow/68638256.cms,en,"RANCHI: The CPI ( Maoist )’s Jharkhand Regional Committee (JRC) has appealed to the people, especially in rural and mineral-rich pockets of the state, to boycott the parliamentary polls in protest against “indiscriminate militarisation and high-handedness of security forces”. Responding to the poll boycott call issued by the Maoists’s Bihar Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC) — the highest strategic unit of the outlawed rebel outfit at the state level — earlier this week, JRC spokesperson Aman told TOI this was perhaps the last option for the villagers to protest against “militarisation”. He said: “Otherwise, they will be pushed out of their own land and the government will hand over all natural and mineral assets to capitalists and industrialists in the days to come.” The Maoists have drawn attention of the people to Mission Samadhan — a common government scheme in the tribal belts of Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. “This mission is not aimed at providing solution to issues like irrigation, education, health facilities or equal distribution of resources. Instead, the samadhan (solution) is being offered to the industrial houses as to how they can grab mineral wealth under protection of the security forces,” Aman said. He also criticised the idea of pitching the country’s armed forces against its own people on the pretext of containing ‘biggest internal threat’. Aman said: “Maoists are never a threat for the common people who are already being subjected to repression and exploitation. Rather, we are threat to the exploiting ruling classes and the extortionist system.” Aman said there is a huge difference between the lifestyle of the rural poor of Jharkhand living in mineral-rich districts and the general elite urban classes working for the capitalist masters. “The villagers are coerced by gun-toting security forces, stopped from raising their voice against exploitation and often manhandled if they try to protect their rights over land, water and forest. This is gradually leading rural Jharkhand towards complete militarisation where democracy has become a farce,” he said. Asking the people to boycott the Lok Sabha elections, the Maoists shared a few anecdotes as to how governance in the mineral-rich belts has been passed on to the industrialists on the behest of the security forces. “On the pretext of industrial security and development, village after village is being targeted where either the locals are forcefully evicted from their land or entangled in false cases and sedition charges after being branded as Maoists. This is eventually forcing the young populace to migrate and opening the villages for exploitation,” he said. JRC, which has also decided to carry out an extensive poster campaign and interpersonal communication in areas where dozens of security camps have come up in the last five years, has asked the people to realize what future they are going to make for themselves if they continue to elect “imperialist governments” in the name of democracy. “People should not lose hope and aim towards formation of a pro-people neo-democracy by joining hands together in the fight for a revolutionary people’s government,” Aman said.

Traffic along Gokhale College , Madhuri Bakery , Tembe Road and Khasbaug Maidan was paralysed for over half-an-hour as the citizens had blocked the road. Citizens claimed that the area was receiving water at low pressure and the odd times at which the water was being supplied was putting them at an inconvenience. The citizens further claimed that the problem has been reported for the first time in the summer season. The protest was called off after in-charge of water supply department Suresh Kulkarni visited the agitation spot and assured the protestors that the timings of water supply would to changed so that citizens receive adequate water. Citizens from the nearby Mangalwar Peth had protested last month for the same reason. A citizen participating in the protest said, ""A few days ago, the taps received water at seven in the morning. Now, the water is being supplied in the afternoon and that too for half an hour. We want the timings to be changed since women have to face a lot of trouble due to the shortage and discrepancies in the timing of water supply."" Local corporators too thronged the spot and pulled up the civic administration for poor management of water supply. Responsing to the concerns of the citizens, Kulkarni said that the water supply was inadequate due to technical glitches at Balinga pumping house. Assuring that the water supply would regain normalcy from Sunday, Kulkarni said that if citizens still complained about shortage of water, then the supply timings would be changed. He further added that officials of the water supply department would keep a close tab on the supply conditions in the internal and old parts of the city since the same problem has been reported twice in the last one month. Local corporator Sachin Patil and former corporator Vinayak Phalke claimed that they had informed the water supply department about the need for changing the timing of the water supply and inadequate shortage.

Action council to strengthen protests,Action council to strengthen protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/action-council-to-strengthen-protests/articleshow/68638486.cms,en,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As the second phase of Kazhakkoottam-Karode NH widening works is progressing, residents of Plavila have objected to digging up of a road in the region for the works. The Kazhakkoottam-Karode Bypass action council has decided to strengthen their protests for construction of an overbridge at Plavila, which can provide connectivity between Marappalam and Nellimoodu. As works continue to progress for the Kazhakootam-Karode bypass project, several restrictions are imposed at Plavila and neighbouring locality, which has made life very difficult for the residents. The works came to an abrupt stop after residents demanded NHAI to approve overbridge at Plavila before digging up the road to make way for the bypass. Residents said that they have requested the same to public works minister G Sudhakaran, district collector K Vasuki and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) regional director over three years ago. Raveendran Tripthi of Plavila said that the bridge could save them crucial time and energy. “There are around three markets, four temples and multiple educational institutions that will become difficult to access if the bridge is not constructed. We will have to go all the way towards Vengapotta, which is 2.5km away, to cross the bypass and further travel another 2km to reach Nellimoodu. If the bridge comes, the same destinations can be reached by travelling 500 metres,” Tripthi said. According to Sherin M S, another resident of Plavila, the road which was used by multiple school buses is used by lots of students and residents. “All of us will be affected if the bridge does not come up and if construction begins for the bypass,” he said. According to action council secretary S Mani Rao , the council demands immediate construction of the bridge. “If the road gets dug up and the bridge does not come, we will be forced to travel a lengthy route to reach the other side. The bypass is supposed to cut through Kinattadi-Thazhankaadu Road which was constructed as part of Pradhan Manthri Sadak Yojana. This means, connectivity between Marapallam and Nellimoodu will be affected. We will protest until the demand for the overbridge is met,” Rao said. ",30 Mar 2019,2019-03-30 00:00:00
Poor water supply: Locals from Cidco nodes protest,Poor water supply: Locals from Cidco nodes protest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/poor-water-supply-locals-from-cidco-nodes-protest/articleshow/68638277.cms,en,"NAVI MUMBAI: Enraged residents of New Panvel gathered near the Cidco water tank premises, Sector 3 demanding regular water supply in the node. Erratic water supply after the festival of Holi has added to their woes and this they claimed is an unending issue. This was the fourth such protest by the residents in the past six months after Cidco failed to give any satisfactory response about the issue. Cidco officials said that the supply was disrupted as Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) took up repair work in its pipeline early this week. Owing to this, they claimed that the water pressure was slowly building up in the tail-end areas and that it may take a day or two for the supply to get streamlined. The neighbouring Kalamboli and Karanjade nodes, too, have been facing water crisis. The dilapidated MJP pipeline has been the major reason of erratic supply in Cidco-developed nodes. Protesters demanded immediate restoration of supply in some areas, which are bearing the non-supply slots for the past few days. They have threatened to come back in larger numbers to put pressure on authorities for their fundamental rights of getting a basic amenity like water. G J Dalal, Cidco executive engineer, water supply, said, “The problem started from Holi when MJP enforced a shutdown to repair the ruptured pipeline coming from Patalganga. It was followed by the Tata Power weekly off on Sunday when it does not release the river water leading to no supply of water. In this case it takes two to three days for the pressure to build up in the empty pipeline for full supply. Most of the areas have started getting good supply and remaining parts will get their quota soon.” Apoorva Prabhu, who led the delegation, said, “We have been facing water scarcity from last September and more severely in the past 20 days. Cidco has been giving the same explanations every time we protest and passes the buck to other agencies. We are asking for at least two hours of supply daily.” “We are working on some modalities as the MJP supply line is over three decades old. We are in the process of repairing the storage tank in Sector 3,” said Rahul Sarode, Cidco deputy engineer. Surendra Dashore, MJP sub-divisional engineer said that the damaged pipelines are being replaced part by part. ",30 Mar 2019,2019-03-30 00:00:00

Party leaders, however, claim that the issue would be sorted out soon. Singh has been replaced by Bhadohi MP Virendra Singh in Ballia for Lok Sabha polls. Slogans like ‘Virendra Singh vapas jao’ (Virendra Singh go back) and ’BJP se Bharat Singh nahi to koi nahi’ (Bharat Singh or no one else) raised by his supporters. However, BJP senior leaders take it casually claiming that the protest would not damage party’s prospect and things would be managed. BJP men took out a procession from the premises of Ballia Zila Panchayat to the party office, where they sat on dharna. Raising slogans against Virendra Singh, they demanded from the central leadership to withdraw its decision of fielding Virendra Singh from Ballia Lok Sabha seat. “We are shocked after knowing the decision of the ‘kendriya netritva’ (central leadership) to field Virendra Singh from Ballia in place of Bharat Singh,” said the latter’s supporter Ashok Singh. “The decision would prove costly to the party in Ballia in the parliamentary poll,” he warned adding that the party workers would not accept Virendra Singh in Ballia as he had done nothing for the district.

After discussion, students agreed for a peaceful protest and sat on dharna outside the senate hall with demand to submit memorandum. Police officials, who were trying to control the situation, were also surprised by the approach of the VNSGU officials who refused to come to accept the memorandum. “VNSGU officials refused to allow a number of senators to speak on important issues citing model code of conduct for election. But by organising senate and tabling budget for next year the university has openly violated the code of conduct,” said Bhavesh Rabari , a sanator. ",28 Mar 2019,2019-03-28 00:00:00

Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy led a joint protest against the central agency, calling the searches 'revenge politics' by the Modi government. The CM addressed Congress-JD(S) workers outside the I-T office here, following raids on aides of top leaders of both parties in the Old Mysuru region. Kumaraswamy singled out BR Balakrishnan, principal chief commissioner of I-T (Karnataka and Goa region), in his fusillade against the department. ""We are not against raids. But we protest selective raids conducted in Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan, Shivamogga and Kanakapura. Don't work as agents of the NDA government in its last hours,'' the CM said. The income tax department said no MP, MLA or minister had been covered in the ongoing searches in Karnataka. Though the department, till late Thursday evening, didn't identify individuals whose properties were searched, sources privy to the developments revealed some details. According to sources, 20 premises of eight individuals, including minor irrigation minister CS Puttaraju's relatives in Mandya and Mysuru were searched. ""Among those whose properties were raided include a senior JD(S) leader in Bengaluru, a business venture of a relative of former PM HD Deve Gowda in Shivamogga, offices of PWD in Hassan and taluk office in Kanakapura. The office of a Congress leader in Kanakapura too was raided,"" they said. Kumaraswamy, who had Congress leaders Siddaramaiah , G Parameshwara, DK Shivakumar, Dinesh Gundurao and JD(S) ministers by his side during his address to the workers of the two parties, took exception to raids on government offices in Hassan and Kanakapura. ""Raid the Hassan PWD engineer's house, not his office. Visit my office in Vidhana Soudha too. Income-tax officials think they are above reproach and descendants of Harishchandra. Everyone knows how a 'settlement' takes place after a raid,'' he alleged. After predicting on Wednesday that 300 CRPF personnel would arrive in Bengaluru to assist in the raids, a furious Kumaraswamy on Thursday said he, too, can unleash the Anti-Corruption Bureau on tax sleuths. Later, in a tweet, the chief minister accused the PM of misusing the income tax department to threaten Congress and JD(S) leaders during elections. ""This is revenge politics; we won't be cowed down by this,"" he said. ",28 Mar 2019,2019-03-28 00:00:00

Raising slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and waving party flags, the Congress and JD(S) activists gathered within hours after the I-T raids with the help of CRPF personnel at 15 to 20 places including Bengaluru, Mandya, Mysuru, Hassan and Shivamogga. Congress and JD(S) activists who tried to storm the Income Tax office were arrested and later released as the protest on the ever busy Queens Road resulted in chock-a-block with hundreds of vehicles stuck in the traffic jam. The ruling alliance was particularly angry as they alleged that the I-T raids were carried out on JD(S) leaders overseeing the elections of Kumaraswamy's son Nikhil Kumaraswamy in Mandya and nephew Prajwal Revanna in Hassan. Taking on the Modi government in the first such protest by the state chief minister against a central department in recent memory, Kumaraswamy lashed out at it for ""misusing"" the I-T department and other central agencies. Terming the Centre's behaviour as an ""assault"" on the federal system, he alleged that Modi has been misusing the constitutional bodies, which shows his ""dictatorial streak."" ""We are not opposed to raids. We are opposing it because it is restricted to a few political parties in the opposition. They want to threaten them,"" a visibly angry Kumaraswamy said. The crackdown came within a day after he claimed last night that the I-T raids had been planned from 5 am on Thursday and he would not be deterred and would protest against it like his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee . In an unprecedented showdown with the Modi government, Banerjee had sat on a dharna after the CBI tried to quiz Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with Saradha and Rose Valley Chit Fund scams. ""They are out to frighten us but the fact is the BJP is shaken and wants to win election by intimidating us. We are not the ones who get scared,"" the chief minister said. Strongly defending its action, the I-T department said its activities should not be politicised, personalised or trivialised. ""We request that the activities of the income tax department should not be politicised, personalised or trivialised. In particular, statements which sound like an incitement to physical violence issued by persons holding very responsible posts are deeply deplorable,"" it added. The searches were carried out on a wide range of professions and businesses including bureaucrats, breweries, MNCs, mining barons, diagnostic centres, trusts, educational institutions, medical colleges, real estate, fisheries, and film industry and including ""politically exposed persons,"" it said. The department also said in a release that no MP, MLA or minister had been covered in the searches and they were being carried out on the basis of credible information. ""A BJP leader sends list of people to Amit Shah, who eventually forwards it to Balakrishnan (principal chief commissioner of income tax department (Karnataka-Goa region) to carry out raids. Balakrishnan is acting as an agent of BJP. It seems that he wants a post-retirement position such as governor of some state,"" Kumaraswamy said. Kumaraswamy questioned BJP state chief B S Yeddyurappa as to whether he could win elections without money. He also said for the first time the I-T officials raided government offices too, such as PWD office in Hassan and Tahsildar office in Kanakapura. The coalition partners said the raids were on people, who were monitoring the electioneering of Nikhil Kumaraswamy and Prajwal Revanna from the Gowda clan, targeting state minor irrigation minister C S Puttaraju and his nephew Ashok, who is a district panchayat member in Mysuru. The raids were also carried out at the residences of PWD minister H D Revanna's close associates Narayana Reddy, Ashwath Gowda and Raya Gowda in Hassan, IT sources said. Revanna's son and former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda's grandson Prajjwal is contesting from Hassan Lok Sabha seat. Nikhil Kumaraswamy and Prajwal Revanna are testing political waters for the first time under the tutelage of Kumaraswamy and PWD minister H D Revanna. Former chief minister and Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah questioned the timing of raids and said they could have been done a month before the election. ""But when the election dates were announced such action raises many eyebrows,"" he said. At Hassan, Revanna said, ""So long as I have the blessings of Sringeri Sharadamba and Shankaracharya, nothing will happen...Anybody conspiring against me or trying black magic will be destroyed. I am so well protected."" Yeddyurappa rubbished the charges, saying the Income Tax department was doing its duty and it should not be linked with politics. He wondered why the Congress and the JD(S) were giving it a political colour when it was against some bureaucrats, contractors and others and not the MPs, MLAs and ministers. According to the I-T department, the searches have resulted in collecting credible evidence on tax evasion. The searches on ""politically exposed persons"" have covered their entire range of the political spectrum, it said. The I-T department also said CRPF personnel being used for the searches had not been flown from outside the state and they were requisitioned from the state police following the normal protocol.

The school has over 300 students, 54 of which are enrolled under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, meaning that their fee is paid by the government. However, as reported by TOI earlier, the school had announced this month that they will not induct students for the next session and asked parents to look for other schools since fund shortage has pushed the school on verge of closure. The school administration has said that they have not received funds under the RTE from the government for over two years. Following this, the education department issued a notice to the school asking them to continue for at least a year. The parents, however, alleged that the school has once again asked them to look for other options since the school will not be functioning after March. Arif Khan, president of National Association for Parents and Students’ Rights (NAPSR) told TOI that the school has given an ultimatum to the parents, laid off teachers and even started selling furniture. “This is in clear violation of the notice by the education department. First, the school declared that they will close down without even informing the students and now they are violating the notice. We have asked the district magistrate to file a complaint against the school,” he said. The officials of the education department, meanwhile, said that they have asked the school to make arrangements for the students to shift to other schools or continue for over a year. “We will look into the matter but we have asked the school to make arrangements for students in other school. Only then they can close down, else they should function for at least a year,” said Asha Rani Painyuli, chief education officer, Dehradun . There are over 95,000 students in various schools enrolled under the RTE but the education department hasn’t released funds of over Rs 200 crore for the past two years, forcing at least two schools to send ultimatum to students.

DU also announced that from the academic session 2019-20, all students joining undergraduate courses under Non-Collegiate Women Education Board (NCWEB) and School of Open Learning (SOL) would follow the revised curriculum based on Learning Outcome-based Curriculum Framework (LOCF). Teachers have objected, saying it was replacing the committee on courses, which is duly notified in the university statue. They also expressed concern over the selection of “three best teachers” by the head of each department as this, they claimed, would lead to bias. Also, no college teacher was made part of it, they pointed out. Calling the decision “thoughtless”, Delhi University Teachers’ Association ( DUTA ) said on Wednesday that it “has learned that the vice-chancellor has decided to abandon any credible academic application of mind and impose the framework (LOCF) that seems to be thoughtlessly derived from a controversial and widely criticised outcome-based model prevalent in the state-funded US universities”. It’s unfortunate that VC Yogesh Tyagi has not allowed UG course revisions proposed by several departments to be tabled in the academic council for over a year now, DUTA added. “It is disturbing to see that the notified schedule for LOCF is nothing short of a hurried and insincere exercise” in which DU expects the entire revision process to take place in three months, it added. However, the university claimed that this “landmark move” would benefit close to seven lakh undergraduate students from the 2019-20 session. The revision committee has developed a dashboard to facilitate the process, according to a statement issued by university registrar Tarun Das. The dashboard will enable teachers concerned to work collectively and share their inputs online, reducing considerably the need of frequent meetings, it stated. ",28 Mar 2019,2019-03-28 00:00:00

But he turned out to be abusive and one day poured kerosene over her before setting her on fire. She survived, but the transwoman was unable to get legal justice. “There is no succour for people like us. So I left Mumbai and came back to Chennai,” says Rambha. Her story is one of more than 100 handwritten testimonials to be displayed as part of ‘Ask them to Shut Up! because the voiceless need to speak!’, an art show by transexuals at British Council from March 29 to April 14. Organized by Sahodari Foundation founder Kalki Subramaniam, it will feature 25 artworks, including acrylic and watercolour paintings. “While the exhibition doesn’t have a specific theme it does have a larger context, which is resistance against judgements, transphobia , stereotyping, and discrimination,” says Kalki, an activist and artist who also conducts art workshops for members of the community. “The name of the exhibition is in itself a protest. We are asking people who discriminate against other people because of gender and sexual orientation to shut up so our voices can be heard,” she says. The highlight, which is part of the foundation’s Transhearts project, is The #MeToo Files. The large acrylic painting shows a transsexual, spitting fury and teeth gritting in rage, clapping. Around the painting are testimonials by transsexual and non-binary people who have endured violence and been shamed by homophobic and transphobic people. “They could be their friends, relatives, or members of the general public,” says Kalki, who with Sowndharya Gopi, collected these stories from people across Tamil Nadu , Kerala, Puducherry, Karnataka and West Bengal over the last year. “Each person made imprints of their hands in red on the handmade paper and then wrote their own story,” says Kalki. “In college, when I was using the hostel bathroom, a boy broke open the door and sexually harassed me. There were other people around but they just laughed at me. It happened when I was 21 and it haunted me for years. I lost my self-respect and was tormented,” says Kalki. The idea is also to help survivors heal themselves. “The participants wanted the world to know what happened to them and want to ensure it never happens to anyone ever again,” says Kalki. “Also, many of them hadn’t spoken about their traumatic experiences to anyone and it’s an outlet for their emotions...” ",28 Mar 2019,2019-03-28 00:00:00

All the candidates had qualified the School Service Commission ( SSC ) examinations held in 2013 and 2017, and are awaiting jobs in state-sponsored schools where teaching posts are lying vacant. The CM met the protesters on hunger strike in front of Press Club in the afternoon. “I have all sympathy for you. I can’t give you any specific assurance because the model code of conduct has come into force. I can only say we will do something for you by first week of June,” she said after going through a report from the education department that reached CMO two days back. While the protesters were in two minds, Banerjee said: “Have confidence in us. We can act if you want some concrete action. We have to take a one-time decision within the legal framework.” She instructed the education minister to induct five members from among the protesters in the five-member committee the government had set up to look into the issue. “The government committee will meet you from time to time. The committee will consist of five officers and five members from your side,” she said. These SSC passouts, desperate to get teaching jobs in government schools, took to hunger strike from February 28. “There has been no recruitment in schools since 2014.

While 85-year-old Kanpur MP and former party president Murli Manohar Joshi hit out by issuing a statement soon after he was asked to sit out for the coming round of polls, protests erupted in Patna and Bengaluru against the party’s decision on the declared candidates. Joshi’s curt statement on Tuesday was addressed to voters of Kanpur, saying he has been asked not to contest polls. It said, “Dear voters of Kanpur, Shri Ramlal, General Secretary (Org), Bharatiya Janata Party conveyed to me today that I should not contest the ensuing parliamentary election from Kanpur and elsewhere.” BJP leaders said the party took a “principled decision” that veterans should make way for younger leaders. The party has also denied tickets to other veterans like Shanta Kumar , B C Khanduri, Karia Munda, Kalraj Mishra, Bijoya Chakravarty , who are over 80 years of age. Reacting to Joshi’s name being struck out, party MP Subramanian Swamy called it an “upsetting trend”. The MP, who has been increasingly out of sync with the BJP leadership, said the seniors were being told in the last minute that they are being dropped. In Bengaluru, the candidature of 28-year-old Tejasvi Surya as the Bangalore South contestant set off protests. The BJP state unit had suggested the name of late K Ananth Kumar’s wife Tejaswini Kumar. While Tejaswini said later in the day that she will support the party’s decision, there were protests by a faction of the party. Tejaswini was confident about fighting the poll and had been preparing for it and had started a door-to-door campaign. She said the party decision came as a shock to her and all of her supporters but maintained that it is very important to show that BJP is a party with a difference. In Patna, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was accosted by protestors raising slogans for BJP Rajya Sabha MP R K Sinha, who was a contender for the ticket. They showed black flags to Prasad at Patna airport. Party sources played down the episode, saying it was led by somebody who had been expelled from the party. They also claimed that Sinha has promised to work for the party’s victory. Tension in another constituency was defused when Union minister Giriraj Singh reluctantly agreed to the party’s decision to contest from Begusarai seat in Bihar. Singh, MP from Nawada Lok Sabha seat, told a news channel,“It is a question of my self-respect. I had wanted to contest from Begusarai in 2014 but was asked to do so from Nawada instead.

Choudhary, too, claimed that the party will have to face collateral damages in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand if his candidature is ignored. However, he wasn’t present during the protest outside the party office. On Saturday, BJP’s high command announced its candidates for 10 of the 13 Lok Sabha constituencies it is contesting in Jharkhand. While the party retained most of the sitting MPs, it replaced Karia Munda, an eight-time MP from Khunti, by much younger partyman and former chief minister Arjun Munda. Out of total 14 Lok Sabha seats, BJP has given Giridih constituency to its ally Ajsu-P. Party sources reasoned age factor behind benching of Karia and said that an attempt is being made to replace leaders who are beyond 75 years. At the same time BJP leaders here added that none is aware about the fate of Ram Tahal’s candidature as the ball is in central leadership’s court now. BJP is likely to announce candidates for remaining three seats on March 25. Ram Tahal Choudhary (77) won the Ranchi parliamentary seat five times since 1991. He refused to accept the age bar. “What has age got to do with elections? I have been active since the last 50 years. Even at this age, I move around within and outside my constituency and attend Parliament regularly,” Choudhary told TOI over phone. “Ranchi is my home bastion and I can assure victory for BJP if it gives me a ticket. I am still sure of getting the ticket. The delay in announcing my name as a nominee for the Ranchi seat is baffling to me as well as my supporters,” he added. Asked if he will still fight even if the party doesn’t give him ticket, he said, “That’s a hypothetical question. I haven’t thought about it.

The protest was joined by Hindu outfits, who even lodged an FIR against the contractor handling the work. Reports said that on Sunday night, a few people found that ‘Ram’ was inscribed on the bricks being used in constructing the drain. Associating it with their religious sentiments, they objected to the construction. On Monday morning, the protest gained momentum after members of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) approached senior authorities of police and Nagar Nigam and demanded immediate stopping of the drain’s work. Realizing the seriousness of the matter, senior Nagar Nigam officials rushed to the spot and ordered removal of the objectionable bricks from the drain. “We along with Bajrang Dal members met district magistrate Shiv Sahay Awasthi and lodged a protest in this matter. He assured us that all such bricks will be removed and action will be taken against the contractor. This incident has hurt Hindu sentiments and we will ensure that strict action is taken against those responsible,” said Anchal Arjariya, general secretary of VHP’s Jhansi unit. Later, acting on a complaint moved by Arjariya, Kotwali police registered an FIR against ‘unknown contractor’ under Section 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) of IPC. “We have lodged a case against ‘unknown contractor’ on a complaint moved by Anchal Arjariya, general secretary of VHP’s Jhansi unit. The matter is being investigated,” SO Kotwali Sanjay Singh told TOI on Monday. Jhansi Nagar Nigan executive engineer B J Gupta said, “It is gross negligence on the part of contractor and junior engineer concerned, and both have been issued warning. We took immediate corrective action and ordered removal of all such bricks from the drain.” ",26 Mar 2019,2019-03-26 00:00:00

The mining ban in the state has resulted in large-scale job losses, said members of Karnataka Gani Avalambithara Vedike (KGAV) who gathered at the Freedom Park here. ""Their livelihood became highly uncertain even after the Supreme Court permitted mining operations to start, as production cap, e-auction and lots of other restrictions lowered the mining capacity that has led to stagnation in the iron ore industry,"" said KGAV spokesperson Rajakumar S. ""Lakhs of lives are hanging in uncertainty due to the discriminatory policies prevalent only in the Karnataka mining sector. This will not be found anywhere else across the globe,"" he added. According to the association, the production and dispatch from the leases are never fixed and fluctuate according to the purchasing pattern of the steel industry. While buyers of iron ore are allowed to buy freely from outside Karnataka, sellers are not allowed to sell freely resulting in huge pile-up of inventory due to lack of sale, they added. Besides, there is also loss of contribution to the District Mineral Foundation (DMF) when ore from areas outside the state is bought by Karnataka buyers. In his appeal to the government, Rajakumar S said: ""We urge the government to ensure our survival by allowing free trade, giving preference to local iron ore over imports, and ensuring regular business for truckers and lakhs of other mining dependents."" After the protest rally, a delegation of 15 members met the authorities to hand over a memorandum of appeal. ",26 Mar 2019,2019-03-26 00:00:00

The villagers have stated that they would boycott the polls unless elected representatives and officials do not give an assurance in writing that their demand would be met by April 5. More than 50 villagers had protested for over a month demanding the PHC in January. On February 13, they gave memorandums to the local MP, MLA, MLC, tahsildar, gram panchayat PDO and president. When they did not get a positive response, the villagers carried out a one-day hunger strike on March 6. Neither politicians nor officials took them seriously. So, the annoyed villagers have given the ultimatum of boycotting the elections. Koganolli is the last village of the district located on the Karnataka- Maharashtra border, attached to Pune-Bengaluru National Highway-4. Dattawadi and Hanabarawadi are the two other villages that come under Koganolli GP. The village has a population of around 20,000. Since there are no proper health services in and around the village, people here are forced to go to Nippani, 17km from village or Kagal or Kolhapur in Maharashtra. A PHC will also benefit the people of surrounding Sulagaon, Mattiwade, Hanabarawadi, Dattawadi, Hanchinal and Shankarwadi village. Krishnat Khot, one of the 50 villagers who have been protesting for over two months, told TOI that their movement has got the support of all villagers, adding that the protest will continue until justice is met.

The protesters were prevented by the police from entering a private property on the hill where they alleged trees have been felled to make way for construction activities. Villagers added that some time ago the owner had submitted a proposal to the Goa Coastal Management Authority for construction of a hotel. The authority directed the owner to approach any one of the seven agencies identified by the Union ministry of environment and forests for demarcating the CRZ area and high tide line.

The villagers have demanded construction of an overbridge on the under-construction national highway bypass at Samrala. They have already threatened to boycott the upcoming Lok Sabha elections if their demand is not met. Set to lose the main road against the construction work, the villagers have put up boards highlighting that they will vote only for the candidate who promises to solve their problem. Many people in villages like Sihala, Toderpur, Jhar Sahib, Kakrala and Behlolpur have shown resistance to the construction of the road (without the bridge) that will bypass Samrala town and increase the distance for them to reach Samrala and Machhiwara. Jasmair Singh, husband of the Sarpanch of Bondli village, said since they will lose the main road to their village which will increase the travel time between their village and the neighbouring towns, they have decided to protest the ongoing construction. He said, “We don’t have a problem with the construction of the bypass, but the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) should provide us with an overbridge so that we don’t have to travel a longer distance to reach Samrala and Machhiwara.” “Not only will the farmers, traders and students from our village will get affected by the construction of the bypass without a bridge, but it will also pose difficulty to the residents of many neighbouring villages. So, we all have come together and decided to protest till our demand for an overbridge is met,” said Singh. Villagers have said they are ready for the long struggle. “Tomorrow from 10am, we will start a protest march from our villages towards Samrala town and expecting over 400 villagers to join us,” said Neeraj Sihala, a social worker from Sihala village. “A few days ago, a team had come to the spot and they told the people that their demands are genuine, but haven’t given us anything in writing,” said Neeraj adding that students without bicycles will have to walk a long distance to reach their schools in Samrala, while many farmers will have to travel more than double the distance to reach their farms, Moreover, the cost of transportation of goods for traders will also increase if the authorities don’t provide a bridge over the road, he said. A villager said, “Normally, we have to travel a distance of about 1 km to reach Samrala, but after the construction of the bypass on the Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, it will increase the distance by three to four kilometres. Also, Machhiwara will get far by a few kilometres.” “We have heard that they are providing entry and exit points near Chehlan village, another such point 3-km north of our village at Dayalpura. The other irony is that the bypass will divide our village, with many villagers having houses on one side of the under-construction road and farmland on the other side.” He added this was a major issue in many villages of the area, and they will decide on voting after proper response from the authorities.

Andhraites will be forced to retaliate in an appropriate manner and launch protests in Telangana,” Naidu said. During his tour of Rayachoti, Badvel, Palamaner, Srikalahasti and Tirupati in Kadapa and Chittoor districts, Naidu asked people to recall the ‘humiliation’ meted out to Andhra people in Telangana and Hyderabad under the TRS rule, after the ‘unilateral division’ of the state. “Despite contributing to the comprehensive development of AP centred around Hyderabad for almost 60 years, we were forced out of Hyderabad in 2014. We were forced to run the government from a bus from Amaravati ,” Naidu said. “But the humiliation meted out to me as well as our people gave me a reason to work even harder to not only protect the interests of the state but to lay a strong foundation for the future capital of Andhra Pradesh that would be better than Hyderabad or any other city in the country. Now after five years, when AP started building the state right from scratch and is progressing better than several well-off states in the country, KCR is unable to digest our progress and has conspired to stall our development with the support of YS Jaganmohan Reddy and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Naidu observed. ''Telangana is creating hurdles for AP on all fronts right from sharing of waters, building Polavaram, paying our dues to the tune of Rs 1 lakh crore which is our legitimate share under different heads. After all this, KCR government is resorting to personalized attacks on our people and our culture.

The residents, both young and old, started the march at New Friends Colony chanting slogans like zahreela plant bandh karo (close the poisonous plant) and swacchh hawa humara adhikaar (we deserve clean air) and stopped finally at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. “We condemn the failure of authorities to shut down the plant despite evidence of toxic emissions from it polluting the area.

A number of them are incumbent MPs. BJP candidates from Meerut, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Amroha are in the firing line. Stating that they still “welcome the saffron party”, the residents and sympathizers are venting their ire in the open against the BJP candidates, and even threatened to use ‘NOTA’ option. Aggrieved residents panned the MPs’ performance in the last five years, calling it a “major failure”. “We welcome BJP in 2019, but will use ‘NOTA’, if Rajendra Agarwal is given a ticket” read banners in different parts of Meerut, such as Sisoli village and Sant Vihar Raj Nagar-Hari Nagar. Not just this, an embarrassing video of people protesting against Union minister Mahesh Sharma has gone viral on social media. Sharma is the current Union minister of State for Tourism and Culture (Independent charge). “We welcome BJP in 2019, but if Mahesh Sharma contests from the Gautam Buddh Nagar seat, let alone votes, we won’t even offer him a glass of water,” angry locals were seen shouting in the video which was apparently shot in Bulandshahr’s Mahip Jangeer village of Sikandrabad – which comes under the Gautam Buddh Nagar Lok Sabha constituency. Rajendra Agarwal is a two-time MP from Meerut. He has been serving the Lok Sabha constituency for 10 years. “Rajendra Agarwal ko vote nahi denge. Hum aisa umeedwaar nahi chahte jo kumbhkaran ki neend soye ho” (We will not vote for Rajendra Agarwal.

Disenchanted residents have also raised concerns against Bulandshahr MP Bhola Singh. They are demanding an immediate change of candidate, or else have openly threatened to “defeat the candidate”. BJP’s trouble doesn’t end here. In Amroha, effigy of MP Kanwar Singh Tanwar was burnt by BJP supporters outside the party office. They threatened that he will not be allowed to enter the villages. “He [Kanwar Singh Tanwar] is not a resident of Amroha. But, he has been given a ticket from Amroha for the second time.

The metropolitan is asking the government to ensure constitutional rights for the Jacobite church. The Jacobite Church will not allow the Orthodox faction to trespass into any church. He asked the government to ensure the rights and control of the Jacobite Church in churches like Kolencherry and Varikkoli, where Jacobites enjoy majority. The Metropolitan said Jacobites are not anybody's slaves or mere voting machines. He alleged that the Orthodox Church has withdrawn from talks with the government-appointed subcommittee and is now trying to take control of churches using force. Meanwhile, Orthodox Church dismissed the allegations saying that these were attempts to malign the image of the Orthodox Church and not implementing the court verdict.

They also protested against the administration’s decision to switch over to CBSE board from the state board and imposition of late fee amounting to Rs 100 per week. According to the parents, the decision to increase the fee was taken by the administration without approval from the Parents Teachers Association. “When the school had proposed to increase the fee by 15%, we were ready to accept it, provided they justified it by showing us the balance sheet of the school, which they have refused till date. Finally, in February, we paid the old fee for 2018-19. However, soon the students received a notice from the school telling them to pay the remaining amount. “The original primary school fee was about Rs19,000 while the secondary fee was around Rs22000, which we have paid. Why should we pay the fee hike which has not been approved by the EPTA yet? It is a government rule that the late fee can only be Re 1 per day after 365 days of non-payment. Why is the school asking for Rs 100 per week?” said a parent. ",24 Mar 2019,2019-03-24 00:00:00

They alleged that the education department brought amendments to the RTE Act by sacrificing the interests of the poor children. According to agitators, under the BEO South just 184 LKG/ Class I seats were available under RTE free quota , which was above 1,000 seats last year. It all started with BEO South authorities publishing the number of seats available in each private school of the block under the RTE quota. As per the list, most of the schools have been kept out of the quota list stating that a government or government-aided school was in the vicinity. But agitators alleged that these government schools are in no way at par with the private schools. “In our ward, private schools offer good education while the government schools have no facilities. A class V student of a private school can talk like a professor, while an SSLC student from a government school of our area can’t write a correct sentence. In such a scenario, how can the government remove the RTE quota from private schools,” alleged Nageshwari, a mother of a 4-year-old. “Why should I send my kid to a government school as RTE quota is my right,” she said. Later, the agitators met the department of public instruction authorities and submitted a memorandum in this regard. ",22 Mar 2019,2019-03-22 00:00:00

""I started taking photos and videos,"" said Jain who visited the spot with a few animal lovers. ""At least 15 people started to hit and punch me on the head and back while shouting angrily, asking why I was trying to stop their 100-year-old tradition,"" said Jain. He claimed he had prior information that it was an ""annual practice"" to burn poultry birds alive and had sought police protection before going there. ""I expected the police to help me end this macabre practice, but I failed to get police cover."" Jain alleged a man wearing a helmet slapped him very hard across the face twice. ""This man appeared to be a cop in civvies...,"" he said. He approached officials of LT Marg police station who escorted him to GT Hospital for a medical examination, and later took down his complaint. A committee member of the Holi event at Tadwadi, Amit Bhadricha, refuted the allegation of any animal cruelty. ""A rooster had been tied on a wooden plank, but was removed before we burnt the traditional Holi.

On March 18, India issued a note verbale — a diplomatic communication — to the Pakistan foreign ministry, giving a detailed account of the incidents including aggressive tailing of the Indian naval adviser by two Pakistani personnel, they said. The note verbale said the naval adviser was ""aggressively tailed"" by two Pakistani personnel in a car while he was going to the High Commission from his home on March 15, according to sources. They said two Pakistani personnel were keeping a watch outside the residence of the naval adviser during a dinner he hosted on March 14. In a separate case, the note said another official of the mission received hoax calls while another staff of the mission was subjected to ""intimidatory"" behaviour by a Pakistani personnel on March 14, the sources said. In the note, India asked Pakistan to carry out immediate investigation into the cases of harassment of Indian officials. India issued a similar note verbale to the Pakistan foreign ministry on March 13, lodging a strong protest over several incidents of alleged harassment of Indian high commission officials between March 8 and 11. In the note , the Indian high commission has sought an urgent investigation into the incidents, saying such cases of harassment are in violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. India's strong protest over the incidents came in the midst of severe strain in bilateral ties between the two neighbours. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after Indian Air Force fighter jets bombed terror group JeM's training camp near Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. Pakistan retaliated by attempting to target Indian military installations the next day. However, the IAF thwarted their plans. The Indian strike on the JeM camp came 12 days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which 40 personnel were killed.

Interestingly, after seeing Bittu’s motorcade, the toll barrier staff tried to let it pass without charging but Bittu forcibly paid toll charges.

He will be given the reply by Ludhiana residents whom he tried to fool by raking up the issue of toll and then running away from it without getting the toll charges waived off permanently,” he said. Bittu however claimed that he was not against paying toll to the company which was executing the national highway work. “The company is not liable to charge the toll if even after collecting crores of rupees it is not completing the pending works which is creating huge problem for residents. Asked why he paid the toll even after the toll authorities were giving him the exemption as an MP, he said, “As an MP I may be exempted from paying toll tax but I am entitled for this facility only when I am travelling in my official vehicle. With the election code of conduct in place, I am not entitled to use my official vehicle and I have been travelling in a private vehicle therefore I have to pay the toll as per rules.” ",21 Mar 2019,2019-03-21 00:00:00

A special court in Panchkula in Haryana acquitted Aseemanand and three others in the case. The verdict came after NIA special judge Jagdeep Singh dismissed the plea filed by a Pakistani woman for examining eyewitnesses from her country, saying it was ""devoid of any merit."" Aseemanand's counsel Mukesh Garg said, “The court has said that the NIA has failed to prove any of its charges against the accused and the evidence against them was treated as not sufficient. Therefore, the court acquitted them."" Pakistan's acting foreign secretary summoned Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria today to lodge Pakistan's strong protest, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement. The acting foreign secretary stressed that Pakistan had consistently raised the ""lack of progress and the subsequent, concerted attempts by India to exonerate the perpetrators of this heinous terrorist act in which 44 innocent Pakistanis lost their lives"". The issue was raised repeatedly, including at the sidelines of the Senior Officials, Heart of Asia Meeting in 2016. Formal demarches were also lodged regularly with India on the lack of progress and acquittal of the accused in other cases, the statement said. The blast in Samjhauta Express took place near Panipat in Haryana on February 18, 2007, when the train was on its way to Attari in Amritsar, the last railway station on the Indian side. The FO said that the acquittal of the accused, 11 years after the ""heinous"" Samjhauta terror attacks ""makes a travesty of justice and exposes the sham credibility of the Indian courts"". ""It also belies the rampant Indian duplicity and hypocrisy where India reflexively levels allegations of terrorism against Pakistan, while protecting with impunity, terrorists who had publicly confessed to their odious crimes,"" said the Foreign Office. It said that the Indian High Commissioner was told that ""systemic Indian decision to gradually exonerate and finally acquit the perpetrators, was not only a gross reflection of India's callous insensitivity to the plight of the 44 families of the deceased Pakistanis, who hoped that India would but also reflective of the Indian state policy of promoting and protecting Hindu terrorists”. Pakistan called upon India to explore judicial remedies to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, according to the Foreign Office. ",20 Mar 2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00

CAIT said the traders will boycott these goods in the larger interest of the country and demanded the government put restrictions on trade with China. CAIT general secretary Praveen Khandelwal pointed out that bulk items were being imported from China, including toys, electronics, mobiles, hardware goods, electrical items, which do not involve inaccessible technology. “It is due to the resentment of the countrymen against China’s attitude that we called for burning Chinese goods. Trade associations across the country organised similar protests at 1,500 places,” Khandelwal said. CAIT president B C Bhartia said, “As Chinese goods are cheaper, consumers buy them without caring about the quality. Since our small and medium enterprises are capable of producing these goods with good quality and affordable prices, the government should encourage them,” he said. ",20 Mar 2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00

Notice for hiring as many as 362 Grade A staff nurses was issued on March 9. On Tuesday morning, around 50 protesters assembled outside the Rims director Dr D K Singh’s office shouting slogans demanding revision of the recruitment advertisement calling it as a violation of the reservation policy. JTMA joint secretary Dr Amit Singh Munda said the whole recruitment process was faulty. “The Rims management has not followed due process of roster while inviting recruitment applications as there are no seats for ST candidates. In any scenario, the number of seats cannot be zero in reserved category and we have demanded to stop the recruitment process until the revision is made,” said Munda, adding that the delegation also handed a memorandum to Singh demanding the same. Other demands included minimum eligibility criteria which is set as BSc Nursing (four-year course) or BSc (Post certificate) or BSc Nursing (Post — basic) should be changed and General Nurse Midwifery (GNM) should be included in the criteria for this post. Aadivasi Chatra Sangh president Sushil Oraon said: “The reservation policy provides us 26% reservation in all state government jobs and the current recruitment advertisement is in violation of that policy. The GNMs future is also at stake after the change in eligibility criteria.” Singh assured the team that a committee will be formed to examine the recruitment process. “The reservation policy will not be violated at any costs. I have listened to the grievances and have assured them that a committee will be formed and the whole process will be relooked. We will rectify whatever is needed,” he said. Another source said the absence of ST seats is a result of conversion of temporary staff nurses into regular ones in 2014. “The majority of nurses who were absorbed as regular staff then were from reserved category and the current number of such nurses are more than approved positions. That is why ST quota in the current advertisement stands at zero,” said a staff nurse at Rims. ",19 Mar 2019,2019-03-19 00:00:00

This is the second time in less than six months that auto drivers on this route—Jadavpur-Taratala—attacked passengers and one of the accused outside South City, Manoj, was a repeat offender. He had earlier been arrested and jailed for behaving rudely with passengers. It took cops—some of them senior officers—from one traffic guard and two police stations rescue the family from the clutches of the auto drivers, who even gheraoed the police officers. Some drivers even tried to block Anwar Shah Road. A case has been registered but no arrest has yet been made. The victims were residents of Bishalaksmitala near Budge Budge, police said. It was around 6.15pm that the family came out of the Anwar Shah Road mall and started looking for an auto to Behala Taratala. But one after the other, the auto drivers reportedly kept refusing them, one of them even claiming to have a flat tyre. All these autos were of the Jadavpur-Taratala route. “After multiple refusals, the woman tried to take the photo of the numberplate of an offending vehicle on her mobile. This apparently infuriated the drivers, who first threatened the family and then tried to snatch the phone away. They hit the man and pulled at his wife so hard they injured her. Two traffic sergeants from the Jadavpur traffic guard were the first to react, followed by two officers and a constable,” claimed the police. Even as the argument between the family and the auto drivers escalated, the five cops from the Jadavpur traffic guard arrived, one of them a woman officer, who reached a little later. The auto drivers, some 40 of them, seemed so brazen about their ways that they literally closed in on the cops who tried to protect the family. On seeing that they were outnumbered by the bully auto drivers, these cops dialled for help from the nearby Jadavpur and Charu Market police stations. Besides personnel from these police stations, a team arrived from the Lake police station and they together finally managed to take the family to the safety of the police station. The auto drivers did not merely stop at intimidating and attacking the family and gheraoing the cops. They even tried to park their vehicles on the road near South City, looking to block a significant section of the Tollygunge-bound flank apparently as a mark of protest, but the cops thwarted their attempt. “A case has been registered at the Lake police station under sections 354 (molestation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed) of the IPC. No one has been arrested yet. There is no CCTV camera covering the exact spot where the incident took place, but we are identifying all the accused and they will be arrested soon,” said an investigating officer. The auto drivers have also lodged a complaint, claiming it was the husband who attacked them first. The police pointed out that drivers Manoj, Kalu and Mohd Idris were among those involved in the fracas. “Manoj has had a case lodged against him by cops from the Jadavpur traffic guard for misbehaving with passengers. He was even sent to jail for it. We suspect it was him and the fellow drivers who instigated the fight,” said an investigating officer. The family later alleged that cops from the Lake police station arrived almost 30 minutes later, allowing the auto drivers to pile up pressure. “Even after there was a commotion on the road, the reaction time from the cops left a lot to be desired,” claimed the woman.

They have warned of intense protests if SBI officials do not respond to their demand. The Association’s office bearer Raju Hireodeyar said SBI’s Anand Nagar branch was closed and merged with the Siddharoodha Mutt branch a few months ago. Though the branch was doing a good business SBI shut it, he alleged. “At the time of closing, the branch had around 14,000 active accounts. SBI officials did not consult with customers and suddenly merged the branch with the Siddharoodha Mutt branch which already had over 25,000 accounts. Anand Nagar residents must now travel for four kilometres to reach the bank now. Pensioners and salary account holders have been hit hard by the bank’s act,” he added. Hiriodeyar alleged that customers must spend at least 4-5 hours to withdraw or deposit cash at the Siddharoodh Mutt branch. Some customers anticipating this inconvenience had protested and also urged senior SBI officials to reverse its decision bank but nothing has happened so far, he said. The members demanded the SBI to restart the Anand Nagar branch and to open an ATM in the locality at the earliest. Imran Yaligar, Nijalingappa Pattar, Shivu Gokavi and others were present.

SFI was protesting against the college authorities’ decision to not allow two of its members, who are under suspension, to appear for the exam. SFI unit secretary Neeraj and joint secretary Ashish, both second year BA History students, arrived at the campus at 9.30am, and argued that the university syndicate had issued an order allowing them to sit for the exam. However, college principal Roy Sam Daniel did not approve the syndicate order. This created a tense situation and police team, led by DSP R Sreekumar, arrived at the college. According to college authorities, the exams were delayed by 15 minutes. However, SFI leaders said there was no issue on the campus which affected the conduct of the examinations. The delay was because students had to wait to take the question paper along with them after the exam. They also said that they had approached the college authorities as the two students had received a favourable order from the syndicate. Meanwhile, the principal said that there were several complaints, including sexual harassment, against the suspended students. Both of them were suspended in December last year for ragging. Since the two students belonged to the SFI union, the syndicate allowed them to write the exam, Daniel said. Now, the decision in this regard will be taken by the college governing council, the principal added. tnn ",19 Mar 2019,2019-03-19 00:00:00

The leaders, who interacted with the media, announced that they would hold a protest in front of KR Hospital to urge the government to reverse the hike in prices, which came into effect on March 1. “The hike in user fees in government hospitals, including at KR Hospital will inconvenience poor patients. The government should roll it back immediately,” said Chamaraja MLA Nagendra. Krishnaraja MLA Ramadas also lashed out at the state government for its flawed implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme. “Unlike other states in the country, Karnataka adopted a different tack to provide benefits of the central scheme to citizens. In other states, beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat can avail of its benefits in all hospitals, but in Karnataka, this facility is restricted only to empanelled hospitals. As a result, patients are put to a lot of hardship,” Ramadas said. The Krishnaraja MLA and former minister said that, in Karnataka, the rules stipulated that a patient first visit a government hospital, and only if the state-run facility could not offer the treatment necessary, could he or she be referred to a private institution. Citing an example of a youngster who suffered a fracture, Ramadas said, “He was asked to receive treatment at both government and private institutions owing to which he suffered multiple complications. This is ridiculous.” Ramadas also charged chief minister HD Kumaraswamy with misleading the public by giving wrong figures on the number of below poverty line beneficiaries of health schemes in Karnataka. “The Karnataka government has pegged the number of BPL card holders at 52 lakh, whereas the actual figure is 1.2 crore,” he said. The BJP leaders said that they would launch the protest at 10am on Tuesday. The other demand the BJP activists had was the issuance of health cards to all beneficiaries.

This protest will continue until the cattle are released and we won't move till then."" The protest started around 9 am and is continued. Just before the Lok Sabha elections, this protest is seen as an issue against the former BJP member Vishnu Lahta and Congress by BJP. JMC mayor, Vishnu Lahta said, ""We are following the orders of high court and have nothing personal behind it. Animals will be released after the orders come from the high court. Due process should be followed, as the owners have violated the orders."" The dairies have been in the walled city since its establishment. A decade back, a judgement was passed by the Rajasthan high court in which the municipality was ordered to shift the dairies running in the city or residential areas to the outskirts. As per the norms, if owners have more than four animals it is considered to be a dairy. Land was also allotted to dairy owners at three places in Jaipur but most of them either did not move or sold their land and shifted back to the city. ",19 Mar 2019,2019-03-19 00:00:00

The incident comes less than a year after police opened fire on demonstrators protesting against the operation of another Vedanta plant, its copper smelter in Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu , killing 13 people. A group of around 70 local people, who are likely to be displaced due to the commissioning of a proposed project by the company, were on a dharna outside the firm’s main gate in Lanjigarh, demanding contractual jobs and education for their children in a public school free of cost. The agitators alleged that the district police along with the OISF personnel used force and resorted to lathicharge to stifle their voice and threaten them to withdraw the protest. “We were on a peaceful dharna. But police forcibly tried to evict us from the spot. When we resisted, they resorted to lathicharge.

So it was quite unusual then when hundreds of students from dozens of schools across Delhi and Gurgaon decided to bunk their classes, they were not only supported, but in some cases even chaperoned by their teachers and guardians. The students were part of a strike against climate change , a global movement spread across 40 countries. The movement was started in last August by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who has been striking from school every Friday for the last seven months to stand outside the Swedish Parliament, demanding that they adhere to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Since then, Greta’s movement has spread across the world, and she has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize . On March 15, students in Indian cities took part in the strike for the first time. Gurgaon students chose the waste art installation in Wazirabad Bundh as their venue of protest. Hundreds of students converged at the site, many still in their school uniforms, carrying banners and placards. The students in Gurgaon chose the waste art installation in Wazirabad Bundh as their venue of protest The students also took to a makeshift stage at the installation. Some spoke, others expressed through music and dance, and students from one school even put up a panel discussion. While talking about the need for students to take up the cause of climate change, Anish Singhal, a Class X student, said, “I feel that this is not an issue that can be just limited to parents or students. We are all together in it. It is not just for one particular section of the society to solve it on their own.” On stage, students spoke about the toll that rapid urbanisation of cities like Gurgaon is taking on the environment. Tarushi Agarwal, a Class IX student, said, “We all have the right to grow and develop, but at what cost? We have forgotten the right way to grow. This race between countries and cities is only resulting in more emissions each year.” While speaking on the stage, Class IX student Vir Khanna said, “Loss of our environment is much greater than any loss in an election. And that’s what we need to tell the political parties of India, that we – the voters of tomorrow – will vote for those who work to save our environment.” A Global Strike! Students across a warming globe pleaded for their lives, future and planet on Friday, demanding tough action on climate change. From the South Pacific to the edge of the Arctic Circle, angry students in more than 100 countries walked out of classes to protest.

As the father of one of the participating students asked, “What will the students do sitting in school when there is no clean air outside?” Recently, data compiled in the IQAir AirVisual 2018 World Air Quality Report prepared in collaboration with Greenpeace Southeast Asia revealed that five out of the top 10 most-polluted cities in the world are in Delhi-NCR with Gurugram being at the number 1 spot. The students took inspiration from Swedish student and political activist Greta Thunberg who had in August 2018 called for a school strike. Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize this year. The children made banners out of waste material, on which were highlighted the pressing issues of the day – air pollution , climate change, a proposed road that would have cut through the Aravali Biodiversity Park. There was also rapping, dance performances and a slogan march. Shivi admitted to feeling extremely “charged”, knowing that many people were voicing their concern for the environment. Campaign group Fridays For Future, which is tracking these protests across the world in 112 countries and 1,787 locations, reports that 186 strikes were planned in Germany, 126 in the US and 123 in Italy. The rallies covered all inhabited continents, and featured events in Brazil, Iran, Japan, India, Ukraine and Russia among other countries. And with Gurugram now officially the world’s most polluted city, students from Pathways, Heritage, Shri Ram and Excelsior American schools turned out in big numbers, along with their parents. One of these peaceful protesters was Arya Dhar Gupta (13). Terming pollution as ‘millennial cancer’, Arya explained that the demonstration was totally aggression and intimidation- free. “We wanted to make a point on how government is pro-development but it should not ignore the environment. Even the United Nations report says India is the world’s most polluted country. All of us signed our hand-prints as a signature to mark the protest,” said this British School student. In Delhi, too, about a hundred students from over 15 schools came out to participate in the strike. At Central Park in Connaught Place, they took turns to speak about the harmful effects of pollution and global warming. They also asked the governments to care for their future. “Instead of talking about how other countries are better, we should start to create a better India. There is plastic everywhere and even the cows eat those,” said a student. Asees Kandhari (15), who called herself a ‘climate rebel’, said, “This is not climate change, this is climate breakdown. We will have to face the worst. You adults have done the damage and need to radically change your ways. We can’t afford to rest until you have done that.” Madhur, a participant at the event, spoke to the children about how she, a pregnant woman, is worried about her future in NCR. “There’s dust and pollution everywhere. How do I protect my baby when he can’t get healthy air in the city? I request politicians to include pollution as an election issue,” she said. Many students also requested politicians to bring in new legislation to improve the environment and air quality. “Companies care only for sales and profit. They are generating a Mount Everest of waste daily. Government has to enforce end producer responsibility and make them responsible for their waste,” said Aditya Mukherji, a student. Many people who came to visit Central Park were impressed by the enthusiasm of the children. Ashish who was at Connaught Place with his friends said that “this is a good step by students, our environment is in danger”. ",16 Mar 2019,2019-03-16 00:00:00
"Delhi, Gurgaon students join global protest against climate change","Delhi, Gurgaon students join global protest against climate change",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-gurgaon-students-join-global-protest-against-climate-change/articleshow/68439250.cms,en,"Normally, when students bunk school, parents and teachers are up in arms against it. So it was quite unusual then when hundreds of students from dozens of schools across Delhi and Gurgaon decided to bunk their classes, they were not only supported, but in some cases even chaperoned by their teachers and guardians. The students were part of a strike against climate change, a global movement spread across 40 countries. The movement was started in last August by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who has been striking from school every Friday for the last seven months to stand outside the Swedish Parliament, demanding that they adhere to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Since then, Greta’s movement has spread across the world, and she has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize . On March 15, students in Indian cities took part in the strike for the first time. The students in Gurgaon chose the waste art installation in Wazirabad Bundh as their venue of protest. Hundreds of students converged at the site, many still in their school uniforms, carrying banners and placards In Delhi, students from different organizations and over 25 schools came together in Central Park , Connaught Place, to join the Global Climate Strike, along with environmentalists, researchers and educators. Amaya Naarang, a Class VI student at the protest, asked, “Why should we go to school and study when our future is being eaten up by climate change? The Earth is already warmer by 1 degree Celsius and is likely to be warmer by 2 degree Celsius if we don’t act. Scientists say there are only 12 years left to ensure that Earth doesn’t get warmer, which will result in a terrible environment to survive in.” Holding handmade placards, the students urged the government to act against climate change. “Despite Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world, there are trees being chopped in the name of development. Not a single political party has environment on their agenda. We demand that government take immediate steps to curb pollution in the city and save our future,” said Gurpreet Kohli, a 15-year-old student from Punjabi Bagh . Amy, who works in the Canadian embassy, said, “We have just shifted here and can already feel the high pollution levels in the city. I am worried it may have an adverse effect on my children’s health in the long-term.” Her 11-year-old son Simon said that the family have made changes in their lifestyle for a sustainable living. “Whenever we go shopping we take our own bags, we use our own glass water bottles and reusable food containers. We don’t use single-use plastic at all,” he said. Students across a warming globe pleaded for their lives, future and planet on Friday, demanding tough action on climate change. From the South Pacific to the edge of the Arctic Circle, angry students in more than 100 countries walked out of classes to protest. The coordinated “school strikes” were inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began holding solitary monstrations outside the Swedish parliament last year.

Sharma also accused that the administration has wrongfully denied payment of PhD benefits as separate from the basic pay and the allowances as well as carried out wrong pay fixation and has denied to count past service. Addressing the teachers, Amanendra Mann, DAV College teacher 's union president criticised the UT administration for creating unnecessary obstructions in the implementation of research degree incentive increment provided in the pay scale notification. Ghanshyam Dev, PCCTU vice-president and Bhupinder Singh, PCCTU secretary, while addressing the rally, flayed the UT administration for its arbitrary actions and apathy towards grievances of the college teachers. They assured that, if need be, the state executive of PCCTU would also join the protests in order to emphasise the resolution of long-standing issues related to college teachers. The teachers marched towards the UT administrator V P Badnore, but were stopped en route by the police. Vice-president said that a five-member delegation led by Madhu Sharma discussed the issue with the home secretary who assured them that action would be taken. They also handed over the memorandum to him. The delegation tabled the demand of the teachers and sought immediate intervention of UT adviser, Manoj Kumar Parida, failing which the teachers would call on the governor en masse on March 27.

The Akali leaders, in their complaint, said that in the audio recording between the minister and Sekhon, it was clear Ashu had made objectionable remarks against Punjab and Haryana high court, and flouted all rules and regulations. “Besides giving a complaint against Ashu, we have also sought a probe into the role of cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, as despite such a serious lapse in which his cabinet colleague is openly heard threatening a public servant and making a mockery of the law, Sidhu has done nothing about it.

Sisodia, said barely an hour after he met the chief election commissioner Sunil Arora on Friday to lodge a complaint against the Delhi Police which, he claimed, was acting at the BJP 's behest to harass call centre employees, a fourth raid was conducted again. ""Demanding fair elections, we are sitting outside the Election Commission to protest against the raid on the call centre. ""After our meeting with the CEC (on Friday), we were assured that he will look into the matter but within an hour we see that a fourth raid is conducted on the call centre,"" he said outside the EC. He said this is the fourth raid on the call centre in four consecutive days. Delhi chief minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal also questioned the CEC. ""Why is CEC raiding our call centres and asking for our data? What is our crime? Pl tell our crime at least,"" he said in a tweet. Kejriwal also urged all party MLAs to join the protest outside the Election Commission. ""Police has raided without any search warrant and is barging into server rooms and interrogating all call centre agents. What is going on? What is the crime?"" he tweeted. ""We need an answer. What is our fault that we are being raided,"" he said in another tweet. Sisodia was joined by other party members, including Lok Sabha candidates Atishi, Raghav Chadha and senior leader Sanjay Singh. Atishi, AAP's Lok Sabha candidate, said they are waiting outside Election Commission till CEC meets them. ""It is responsibility of EC to ensure free and fair elections and not let BJP's Delhi Police intimidate our call centres,"" Atishi said. A BJP team had earlier met Arora and alleged that the AAP was making ""misleading"" phone calls about the city's electoral rolls. Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls scheduled to begin on April 11, the Election Commission had directed the police to take ""necessary action"" against people making such calls. An FIR was also filed in this matter. The AAP leaders asserted that they were responsible for hiring the call centre employees to make people aware that names had been deleted from voters' lists and the police should question the leaders instead of the workers. The AAP alleged that BJP got more than 30 lakh voters' names deleted in Delhi. When the Aam Aadmi Party started talking about this issue and hired a call centre to inform voters about it, the BJP got rattled and ordered the Delhi police to harass the call centre employees, the party alleged. During the earlier meeting with Arora, Sisodia urged the EC to direct Delhi police to stop the harassment of the call centre employees. ""The Delhi police is working like goons. We urged the EC to stop the Delhi police from doing it. They (Delhi police) are pressuring and harassing the call centre employees. ""They are not making proxy calls, they have been hired by the Aam Aadmi Party, we have entered into an agreement with them to do it,"" Sisodia said after meeting at the EC.

They have been demanding an amendment to rules by the defense ministry, which would help residents get clearance for construction and maintenance of land and houses which are in close proximity to Pangode military camp . After several attempts, the Nanma Koottayma is conducting dharna in front of AG’s office at 4.30pm on Friday. A defense circular dated May 18, 2011 had put forth restrictions on any form of construction within 100 metres of a military establishment. A no-objection certificate (NOC) has to be secured from camp authorities before taking up any construction works in the prescribed limits. As the circular caused widespread upheaval across the nation from large numbers of people who were affected by the issue, an amendment was introduced on October 21, 2016 which decreased the restrictions to a certain extent. For around 149 military camps the prescribed distance was shortened to 50 metres and for another 193 stations it was shortened to 10 metres. Unfortunately, apart from Kannur, no other camps in Kerala including Pangode made it to the amended list which has put the residents in dire distress. On 15 March, 2018, the collective forwarded the first representation to Shashi Tharoor MP demanding Pangode to be included in the amended list. The defense ministry in its response informed that such a relaxation will not be applicable for Pangode. Tharoor will inaugurate the dharna on Friday. General convener of Nanma Koottayma S Prasannakumar, said that they only wanted permission to build and maintain buildings on their own land. “Apart from Jammu and Kashmir, most of the military camps across the nation made it to the amended list apart from those in our state.

But given that films, especially political satires, have not had it easy with the smallest of criticisms inviting protests from political outfits and leaders, it is interesting to understand what makes filmmakers dabble with controversial topics and can they really exercise their freedom of expression. Making a political film is a risk that filmmakers take. Threats of a boycott, trolling on social media and, in case the film is not released, loss of producer’s money and waste of effort, are the most commonly faced issues. Not too long ago, the Tamil Nadu government took objection to scenes that dealt with freebie culture in A R Murugadoss’s ‘Sarkar’. After a few forced cuts and a promise from the director that he will not criticize government policy’s in future, the film was released. But for some creative minds, opposition does not deter them. From ‘NOTA’ to ‘LKG’, there has been no dearth of films that have tried to hold a mirror to the political state of affairs. Adding to this list are Selvaraghavan’s ‘NGK’, Venkat Prabhu’s ‘Maanaadu’, which have a politics at the core of their story. Three weeks ago, LKG (Lalgudi Karuppiah Gandhi) created waves for being openly critical about national and state politics. Speaking to TOI, R J Balaji, who played the protagonist says, ""The movie, a political satire, shows all that has been happening from the 1960s. A lesson of sorts for youngsters who are least concerned about politics."" The use of the 1954 song ""Ethanai Kalam Dhaan Ematruvaar Indha Naatiley…"" (How long will they cheat us in this country) from the MGR-starrer ‘Malai Kallan’, showed how the issues that people face have not changed. ""The movie spares none. It is a political satire and whatever has been projected in the movie portrays transparency and true incidents. By bringing in former politicians Nanjil Sampath and J K Rithesh I wanted to make the script as real as possible,"" says Balaji, who has largely garnered appreciation among the few threats and negative comments that branded him a DMK stooge. From ‘Parasakthi’ to ‘Palaivana Rojakal’ and ‘Amaidhi Padai’, films have been a vehicle of propaganda, political awareness and introspection. The best political films are those that leave the audience with an insight, says producer and founder-dean of BOFTA G Dhananjayan. ""There is a difference between political satire with an intention to isolate and mock one party and the other is when it is an objective take on the system. In case of ‘LKG’, it is done in a comical way by criticizing one and all, doe intelligently,"" he says. Except for the master political satirist Cho Ramaswamy, whose film ‘Muhammad Bin Tughlaq’ ridiculed the leaders of both the DMK and the Congress at the Centre and political parties in general, there have hardly been any direct parodies of the government. Balaji feels ‘LKG’ escaped the scrutiny because he is not in the big league. When Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan or Vijay utter a statement, it is has a bigger affect. But having spoken about beef ban, cow vigilantes and Sellur Raja’s thermocol attempt in ‘LKG’, the actor believes there is more freedom now when compared to five years ago. He praises the organic way in which the Central Board of Film Certification reviewed the film. On his entry into films, Nanjil Sampath, says agreeing to be a part of a political satire has been the best decision for him. The former politician from a small town in Nagercoil received a hero’s welcome in his home town after the movie was released. ""The acknowledgement is once in a lifetime,"" he says. A reflection of the power of cinema. ""Movies should not be just about entertainment, it should agitate, inform and anger the audience."" ",14 Mar 2019,2019-03-14 00:00:00

The Congress has lodged a complaint with the chief election officer against the BJP for violating the model code of conduct. In his complaint, Congress district president, Etawah, Uday Bhan Singh, said that the Election Commission has designated almost 80 percent of the district's primary schools as polling booths. He also alleged that the local administration was supporting the BJP. Singh added that 397 polling booths will be set up in primary schools - out of the total 448 in Jaswantnagar constituency. Similarly, there will be 441 in Bharthana constituency and 281 in Etawah city, out of the total 483 and 430 polling booths, respectively. Acting on the Congress complaint, additional district magistrate, Gyan Prakash Srivastava, who is also additional election officer in Etawah, has asked the BSA to remove all the paintings and posters related to the party symbol 'lotus' from the schools' walls and report the matter within 24 hours. Talking to TOI, Srivastava said that he has directed the BSA that strict action will be taken if the s ymbols are not removed immediately. Etawah BSA Ajay Kumar Singh said that it is true that 'lotus' and 'tiger' are being painted on the walls of the 1,775 existing schools under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan scheme in the district due to its ""national significance"". However, it has been removed from all the schools now. ""If the lotus comes up in some other place, it will be immediately removed too,"" the Etawah BSA added. ",14 Mar 2019,2019-03-14 00:00:00

Earlier in the day, a scuffle had broken out among some students and the police when the former were caught riding bikes without helmets. Despite several students dying in bike accidents over the years, students have failed to adhere to safety norms. When contacted, in-charge dean, Prof RK Mandloi said MANIT has never encouraged students to not to follow traffic rules. “I am transport expert. MANIT always ensured that students must follow traffic rules. We even tried to make the campus free of vehicles in the past, but due to pressure from students and their families, it could not be implemented,” Mandloi told TOI. About Tuesday’s incident, he said, “I have no idea about it. A meeting will be called to discuss the entire issue that took place.” Cops have also launched a probe about the issue. Though several times in the past, the MANIT management had made the campus a bikefree zone and even tried to impose a total ban on hostellers using vehicles inside the campus, the rules were never implemented. Former MANIT director, Appu Kuttan (2011-2016), tried to keep the campus a bikefree zone several times, but in vain. A senior faculty, who did not wish to be named, said the rule was implemented, but revoked within a few days. It was revoked as students continued to defy the no-bike policy with vehicles freely moving around the campus. Students had claimed that they would comply with the rule if the authorities first provided them proper facilities like laboratories. “It was decided in 2014 that two-wheelers and four-wheelers were not allowed to enter the campus. Only teachers living on the campus were allowed to keep vehicles and that also after proper permission from MANIT to use them only when they were going outside the campus. But even that decision could not be implemented,” sources said. Currently, over 5,000 students are studying in the institute. According to authorities, almost 60% students ride motorbikes on the campus. ",14 Mar 2019,2019-03-14 00:00:00

The AAP leaders landed at Sunlight Colony police station after they allegedly got to know that some executives of these call centres had been called by cops for questioning. AAP’s national convener, Arvind Kejriwal, also hit out at BJP president Amit Shah over the issue. “Amit Shah got two call centres of ours raided today morning. The owners of the call centres are being called to the police station and intimidated. They are being asked to stop working for AAP. Will Amit Shah fight election like this?” Kejriwal tweeted while daring the police to arrest him and AAP leaders. Singh wrote to the election commission demanding action against the cops involved. Raghav Chadha, the AAP candidate for the South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, alleged that the police were working on the directions of BJP. “If they consider getting voters’ names reinstated is a crime, they must arrest us. If BJP thinks they can intimidate and threaten those who work with us and shut down our awareness campaign, they are mistaken and we will not let it happen,” Chadha said. Singh claimed that “BJP is afraid of AAP before the elections and is resorting to such tactics to threaten us”. AAP has alleged that the names of 30 lakh voters have been deleted by the election commission in a conspiracy hatched by BJP. Rejecting the allegations as baseless, the commission has said around 10 lakh new voters have been added since 2014. In the past few months, calls had been made to a large number of voters in Delhi about deleted names. However, after many voters found their name in the electoral roll, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari accused AAP of lying to citizens. A BJP delegation also met the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Delhi to complain about the phone calls. Later, the CEO asked Delhi Police to take necessary action against the misleading phone calls.

MCG mulls moving Gurgaon Utsav out of Aravalli Biodiversity Park after protests by green activists,MCG mulls moving Gurgaon Utsav out of Aravalli Biodiversity Park after protests by green activists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mcg-mulls-moving-gurgaon-utsav-out-of-aravalli-biodiversity-park-after-protests-by-green-activists/articleshow/68391754.cms,en,"For about a decade, Gurgaon Utsav has been one of the biggest annual cultural events in the Millennium City. Over the last eight years, the three-day cultural fiesta has been organised at the amphitheatre in the Aravalli Biodiversity Park. This year, however, the festival may see a change in venue. Last week, a group of environmentalists met officials from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to express their objection to the park hosting Gurgaon Utsav. Their argument was that since the Aravalli Biodiversity Park is a deemed forest, there should be no concretisation and no musical nights there. Officials of MCG – which supports the festival – say they are now looking at alternative venues for the festival. This also means that the festival might be postponed from its currently scheduled dates of March 15-17. Gurgaon Utsav is organised by a not-for-profit organisation called the Art and Literature Society, with the MCG providing administrative support. This year’s edition is slated to bring to the Millennium City artists like Hans Raj Hans , Hari and Sukhmani, Parvathy Baul, and Mita Vashisht. Last week, environmentalists from Gurgaon-based NGO Haryali Welfare Society met MCG Commissioner Yashpal Yadav, requesting him to intervene and shift the utsav out of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park. Gurgaon Utsav has been held annually at the amphitheatre in the Biodiversity Park Vivek Kamboj, founder and director of the NGO, tells us, “We are not against music and cultural celebrations but there are other places in Gurgaon where this festival can be held. If the construction of a highway causes disturbance to the flora and fauna in the Biodiversity Park, a music event with speakers and amplifiers does so too. The strong floodlights, loud noises, and so much of human activity jeopardises the sensitive ecosystem of the Biodiversity Park and its wildlife. Also, the court has called the biodiversity park a deemed forest, which means any concretisation and such musical activity here is ethically wrong.” MCG Commissioner Yashpal Yadav referred the matter to relevant officials in the civic body. It was this second meeting that bore fruit for the environmentalists. MCG Joint Commissioner Hari Om Attri, who met the environmentalists, says, “We have taken note of the objections raised by some citizens and activists about Gurgaon Utsav, and on the face of it, the objections seem genuine and legitimate. We are discussing and also speaking to the forest and wildlife departments, who are trying to ascertain the facts. If found true, we will shift the event out of the Biodiversity Park and look for an alternative venue.” Organisers of the Gurgaon Utsav remain tight-lipped about the development, saying that the MCG will decide the fest’s future and venue and they shall abide by the decision. Activists have said that the amphitheatre in the Biodiversity Park is a violation of the Forest Conservation Act 1972 and Wildlife Protection Act 1980 that prohibit any non-forest activities there In any case, even if the fest takes place at the Biodiversity Park this year, it might be the last time it is staged there. The activists have said that the amphitheatre in the Biodiversity Park itself is a violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1972 and Wildlife Protection Act, 1980 that prohibit any non-forest activities there. Sources from the MCG say senior officials are contemplating stopping all musical activities there. “Both the forest department and wildlife department are preparing reports based on the allegations and we feel it might be best that in the future, the amphitheatre isn’t used for events like musical nights that can disturb the animal population there,” says an MCG official who did not wish to be named. Interestingly, the amphitheatre was built in the Biodiversity Park after consultation with environmentalists and local residents. The Biodiversity Park used to be a stone quarry and was restored to its current status as the ‘green lung of Gurgaon’ by IAmGurgaon, a citizen’s collective, almost a decade ago. It was during this restoration in 2010 that the MCG built the amphitheatre in after consulting with IAmGurgaon. Latika Thukral, founder, IAmGurgaon, tells us, “When the amphitheatre was conceived, it was done close to the edge of the park, as close to the habitation as possible, so that it didn’t disturb the ecosystem. The aim was never to be disruptive or harm the wildlife or ecosystem of the park in any way. We have and will always have the best interests of Gurgaon and the Biodiversity Park in our minds.” In Video: MCG mulls moving Gurgaon Utsav out of Aravalli Biodiversity Park after protests by green activists ",14 Mar 2019,2019-03-14 00:00:00

The move will allow paramedics to do surgeries, castrations, and give vaccinations and anaesthesia, which only doctors are qualified to do. The government plans to fill 125 posts of veterinarians by recruiting ‘livestock supervisors’, said Dr Atul Patil. Livestock supervisors, on par with ward boys in hospitals for human beings, assist doctors. “Now, the government is putting ward boys in place of doctors,” said Dr Patil. To facilitate promotion of livestock supervisors, the government has designated them as assistant livestock development officers (B), said a veterinarian. A final year student said, “It’s illogical to compare knowledge and skills acquired by a degree-holding vet during eight years to that of a diploma holder who studied for two years. It is complete injustice to the health of animals that will suffer in case of mishaps. The animals which these officers will treat mainly belong to farmers. Loss of such livestock due to incompetent knowledge is not something which can be borne by a farmer seeing their financial condition in our country.” Veterinary students at the undergraduate, postgraduate and doctorate levels, have stayed away from lectures and clinical work to protest against this. Maharashtra Veterinary Students’ Association has written to the government to roll back its decision. The letter stated, “This move comes at a time when the world is trying to stop spread of diseases from animals to humans… A large number of veterinary graduates are available in Maharashtra and it is wrong to let less qualified persons do their job…” A professor of veterinary medicine, practising for almost three decades, said the government’s move was “just not right”. “Veterinary Council Of India Act states that only veterinary graduates can treat and diagnose… The government’s move will put animal health at risk,” the doctor said. Despite the strike, the students have deputed one or two doctors to attend to hospital duty so that “ailing animals do not suffer”. Vets across the state, mainly in government establishments, are supporting the students’ strike. “When there is no shortage of vets, why should the government pass a resolution to promote under-qualified diploma holders,” said a vet surgeon .

The farm organisation demanded that the paddy transplanting should be allowed from June 1. Aiming at saving the depleting underground water table, the state government last year had fixed the date for paddy transplantation from June 20. Earlier it was June 10. The BKU (Ekta Dakonda) state president Buta Singh Burjgill and general secretary Jagmohan Singh said that the moisture content increased in the paddy transplanted from June 20 as when it matures and is ready for harvesting winter sets in, which increases the moisture content. The farmers thus have to face a lot of hardship as the procurement agencies do not accept the crop with more moisture content more than the permissible limit of 17%. Also when transplantation is allowed from June 20, all farmers go in for sowing en masse, which increases the load on electricity grids and many a time these break down. They said presently the varieties which are produced take more than 120 days in maturing and late sowing of these varieties is not in favour of anyone as the damage causes loss even to the state economy. Meanwhile, activists of the farm organisation continued with their protests to get back cheques from banks on day two. They took out a protest march here on Wednesday.

Somewhere, something has happened, which is not desirable and not good. As a political party, they have taken action,” he said. Rao, however, added that if the AIADMK leadership is seen as insensitive or not justice-oriented, there would be a problem. “But I believe that AIADMK is conscious about the issue and will take action.” In a petition to deputy commissioner of police L Balaji Saravanan on Tuesday, AIADMK district IT wing secretary R Sasikumar said that DMK was trying to tarnish the images of AIADMK over the issue. “They also spread rumours against minister SP Velumani and deputy speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman. Stringent action should be taken against DMK youth wing deputy organisers Ranjithkumar and S Dhandayuthapani from Sulur for spreading rumours against the ministers,” the petition said.

After its initial deliberations, BJP has already hinted at changing about 40% of its sitting MPs to beat anti-incumbency and poor performance. The saffron party also doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to release the name of its candidates. “BJP will decide on the candidates for LS election only a day ahead of filing the nomination papers to avoid conflicts within the party. The first phase of polling will be on April 29. This time winnability would be the main criteria and the party is in a mood to drop names of more than 40% sitting MPs including those who have not performed well during the last five years,” a senior state BJP functionary told TOI. BJP veteran Babulal Gaur, joined by a few other local leaders, has also demanded to field local candidates from Bhopal including other prominent constituencies in the Lok Sabha election to check defection and sabotage in the party. “I had been personally offered a ticket by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Bhopal visit last year when he said, ‘Gaur Saab Ek Baar Aur’ (One more time, Mr Gaur). I am expecting that party would field me from Bhopal seat,” reiterated Gaur. The BJP veteran was joined by former minister Umashankar Gupta who lost the assembly poll from Bhopal South Central seat. “Gaur ji and I favour of local candidates, but would leave the decision to the party. If offered the seat, I would contest from Bhopal,” Gupta told reporters after a short meeting with Gaur at the latter's official residence, on Tuesday. Other leaders who have staked a claim from Bhopal include sitting MP Alok Sanjar, Bhopal mayor Alok Sharma and state BJP vice-president Vijesh Lunawat. Two state spokespersons, Deepak Vijayavargiya and Rajneesh Agrawal were also demanding tickets from Vidisha and Sagar respectively. Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is eying Vidisha seat from where Union minister Sushma Swaraj has declined to contest. Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar is finding its difficult in Gwalior and is seeking a ticket from Khajuraho, Vidisha or Bhopal while BJP state president Rakesh Singh will contest from his home constituency in Jabalpur. Party sources said Rajya Sabha member Prabhat Jha, Union minister Thawar Chand Gehlot and former Union minister Faggan Singh Kulaste and former state BJP chief Nandkumar Singh Chouhan may also be fielded by the party. Apart from Bharti, all are members of state election committee. “The national leadership is holding a series of meeting to decide the criteria for ticket.”, BJP national vice-president, Prabhat Jha told TOI. State BJP office-bearers and senior leaders who are claiming for the tickets include state general secretary, Vishnu Dutt Sharma, former union ministers Satyanarayan Jatia and Vikram Verma, former Rajya Sabha member Raghunandan Sharma, senior leaders Maya Singh, Krishna Murari Moghe, Kailash Vijayavargiya, Jayant Malaiya, state vice-president Vinod Gotia, former MLA Chaudhary Rakesh Singh, state Mahila Morcha president Lata Elkar, Archana Chitnis, sitting MP from Morena Anup Mishra, former MLA from Badnwar, Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat, and MLA from Mandsaur , Yashpal Singh Sisodia. A few dissent notes have already arrived from within the saffron party. ""I have not demanded Lok Sabha ticket from the party. The party should come to me with an offer. Senior leaders like Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who is already an MLA from Budhni, should not contest or decide on the name of the candidates"", said Raghunandan Sharma, on Tuesday.

The residents had filled contaminated water in bottles and staged a demonstration outside the N-7 elevated storage reservoir . According to the protesters, houses from F 60/7 to 60/10 ( Ram Mandir Chowk ) and F1 to F20 in N-7 are not getting water through tap. Meanwhile, houses in F7 and F9 of the same area are receiving contaminated water for the last two months. “Our repeated representations to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials have fallen on deaf ears. When we call the officials concerned during water supply timings, they never answer the calls,” Kashinathrao Kokate, one of the residents, said. Municipal commissioner Nipun Vinayak is on a 10-day leave and additional commissioner was also not available. Subsequently, the residents spoke to water works engineer Ashok Padme who said that he will look into the issue in the next 8 days. However, social worker Ravi Patil said that Padme has been giving empty assurances for the last two months and has not been able to address the issues raised by the people. “After consuming contaminated water, cases of gastro have emerged in our area. If the matter is not resolved in the given time, we will resort to a sit-in agitation in front of the municipal corporation office,” Patil said. Parijat Nagar in Cidco N-4 received contaminated water again on Tuesday. The posh locality has been getting contaminated water for the past 8 months, but the AMC has not been able to identify the cause of contamination. Complaints of contaminated water supply have also come in from old city areas like Townhall, Buddi Lane and Katkat Gate. Shahar Parivartan Aghadi activist Rahul Ingle said that steps taken by municipal commissioner like setting up a war room for water supply and roping in water expert have not helped. “A tender of around Rs600 crore has been passed for installing closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and smart bus stops but there is no plan for safe water supply,” Ingle said.

Not budging despite pressure from people in the area, the authorities removed several encroachments starting from the Deolai Crossroad. Even one constructed structure was razed after police insisted on removing all encroachments. Most of the shops that were removed were found to have been rented out, and tenants were left fuming. Most of the landlords just stayed away while the anti-encroachment drive was on. Locals say authorities had not issued any prior notice and were acting arbitrarily. Police had taken cognizance of frequent fatal accidents on the Beed Bypass stretch and put their weight behind the civic body’s anti-encroachment drive. Police say that although there is a ‘maintain status quo’ order from HC , people are violating it rampantly by carrying out construction or putting up makeshift stalls. “Status quo order is binding on the state as well as other parties. The ground reality is that construction has continued and space reserved even for the service road has been taken up,” a senior police officer said. Local people said over a dozen people have reached out to the HC, which in 2017 gave a status quo order. Despite that, the civic authorities have gone ahead with the drive.

Dadhi Pusika, president of Niyamgiri Surakshya Samiti, an outfit working to protect the interests of Niyamgiri tribals, told TOI that they will stay away from the elections because the Dongrias are living in fear due to the high-handedness of security personnel and police. “We elect political leaders every five years to address our issues but they forget us after the election. Neither the state nor the Centre has provided us with minimum basic amenities. When we were trying to live peacefully with whatever facilities we have, they deployed security personnel in the hills. Some of our brothers and friends were labelled as Maoists, arrested and harassed. Police and security personnel have snatched our happiness from us,” said Pusika. Lada Sikaka, a senior leader of the samiti, said their people fall ill by drinking contaminated water. “We do not have roads or teachers to educate our children. We live in the hills like aliens. Nobody pays heed to our problems. Why will we take part in the elections? So, we have decided to boycott them,” he added. Chandra Majhi, sarpanch of Trilochanpur panchayat, said newborns and children in the hills die due to lack of health facilities nearby. Malnutrition and infection are taking a toll on children’s health. “Even the security personnel deployed in the area have taken shelter in Trilochanpur panchayat office and we cannot carry out work there. I feel helpless that I cannot work for my tribal brothers and sisters. I support their election boycott call,” he added. This tribe came to the limelight for protesting against bauxite mining in Niyamgiri hills and saying no to mining through gram sabhas organised in the hills in 2013. Around 8,000 Dongria Kondhs live in more than 100 villages in the hills. Superintendent of police (Kalahandi) Battula Gangadhar said police do not arrest anybody from the Niyamgiri hills. “It is not true that local police harass the Dongria Kondhs. We have not arrested anybody from the hills. The CRPF personnel stay inside the old building of the panchayat; work on the new panchayat office is going on smoothly,” he added.

The teachers have been demanding the implementation of the 60-year-old policy, which states that 22,000 guest teachers can continue working in Delhi government schools and retire after attaining 60 years of age. The teachers also alleged that they were manhandled by the cops. The 60-year-old policy was passed by the Delhi cabinet on March 6 and has been sent to the lieutenant governor for approval. But with the Model Code of Conduct kicking in after the announcement of the LS poll dates, it is unlikely that the policy will be notified. The teachers have been protesting since March 1, after their contract ended. ""We have been here for long time because it is the BJP who can ask LG Baijal to pass the policy.

The Congress, on Monday evening, also issued a whip to party MLAs telling them to abstain and not cast their vote in the MLC elections. The whip issued by CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, if violated, will allow the Congress to seek the suspension of defected MLAs if they voted. The Congress had fielded Gudur Narayana Reddy in the MLC election under the MLA quota as it had 21 MLAs, including two of its ally TDP, the required numbers to win one MLA seat. However, days ahead of MLC polling on March 12, four of the 19 Congress MLAs announced that they would be defecting to the ruling TRS amidst reports that many more of them are likely to defect to the ruling party. Of the two TDP MLAs, one legislator from Sattupalli also announced that he would join TRS soon. With this, the TRS and MIM seem all set to win all the five MLC seats under the MLA quota. As per the Congress, by boycotting the MLC election, the party aims to expose chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and the TRS’ act of allegedly luring Congress and other opposition party MLAs with money and other benefits. “This is a very dangerous trend being set by KCR and a debate is needed on the issue,” said CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka. “We will write to all national and regional parties in about KCR luring Congress MLAs and how anti-defection law is not being applied in Telangana,” Bhatti said. According to TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, KCR has stooped down to the lowest levels of politics by luring Congress MLAs despite having a clear majority. “KCR is not only denying plum posts to senior leaders within the TRS for the sake of defecting MLAs but also insulting the public mandate which had elected MLAs on Congress ticket,” the TPCC president said. “People should realise the deliberate and willful violation of Constitution and every law in encouraging defections by the KCR-led TRS. Though the Congress cooperated with the TRS in the unanimous election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, the ruling party’s attitude is undemocratic. KCR is resorting to undemocratic, illegal and unethical practices to engineer defections from opposition parties,” he added. AICC secretary V Hanumanth Rao said that the KCR-led TRS boat will capsize as it is being overloaded beyond capacity. ",12 Mar 2019,2019-03-12 00:00:00

The protesters, roped in from the party's frontal organisations, raised the demand for full statehood and claimed that Congress was not interested in getting full statehood for Delhi.

With the demand for full statehood at its centre, AAP has launched its campaign for LS polls and CM Kejriwal has made it clear that ""this time Delhiites will vote to make Delhi (a) full state and not to elect the PM."" AAP has ruled Delhi for over four years now after forming the government with a brute majority. But the recurring theme of its tenure has been the constant tussle between the state government and the Centre. The party claims that it cannot do as much as it wanted for public welfare because of ""obstructions"" caused by the Centre, through the LG. ""We want to tell the people of Delhi that for leaving the capital a half state, both the Congress and BJP are responsible,"" said a AAP leader. ",12 Mar 2019,2019-03-12 00:00:00

The foreign ministry's office in Hong Kong said the speech Sam Brownback gave Friday ""slandered"" China's religious policies. It said it had registered its dissatisfaction Saturday with the US consulate in the semi-autonomous Chinese region, where the speech was given. China's constitution and laws protect freedom of religion and critics should ""cease their slander of China's policies on religion and the situation with freedom of faith and cease using religious issues to interfere in China's internal affairs,"" the office said in a statement. US officials and UN experts say China is believed to be holding 1 million Uighurs Muslims and members of other majority Muslim ethnic groups in political education camps in Xinjiang. The US and other governments have criticized the crackdown. The Chinese government says those camps are vocational training centers designed to rid the region of extremism. Brownback said President Donald Trump's administration is ""deeply concerned and considered it a deliberate attempt by Beijing to redefine and control these Muslim minority groups, (their) identity, culture and faith."" He urged Beijing to grant free access to the camps to investigate claims of abuse of inmates. More generally, Brownback said, China is ""at war with faith."" ""It's a war they will not win,"" he said. ""The Chinese Communist Party must hear the cry of its people for religious freedom."" Brownback was expected to meet local religious leaders and religious studies students and instructors while in Hong Kong. The territory enjoys freedom of speech and religion far beyond that in mainland China, where the officially atheist government keeps tight control over any potential challenges to its authority. Brownback, the former governor of Kansas, was due to travel to Taiwan for a regional meeting on religious freedom Monday. In his speech, the Catholic conservative called on China to release Wang Yi and John Cao Sanqiang, detained pastors in the ""underground"" church that operates independently by official government agencies.

Punjab deputy leader of opposition Sarvjit Kaur Manuke added that the Congress had failed on all fronts and had also retracted from the assurance of holding an inquiry into the Ludhiana land scam on the floor of the House as nothing had come out of the discourse. This was nothing but a mere well-thought-out design of the government to offer a protective cover to Ashu.

Pakistan Peoples Party's parliamentary leader Sherry Rehman raised the issue during a session of the Senate, regretting that the name, photograph and mention of the twice-elected prime minister of Pakistan was missing from the official advertisement, the Dawn reported. She said Bhutto was an identity of Pakistan and her achievements brought her worldwide fame. She said roads were being named after Benazir Bhutto in different parts of the world while international universities were creating chairs in her name. She sought an official apology over the issue and an amendment to the advertisements by the evening, before the opposition staged a walkout from the House in protest over the issue. Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, leader of the House in the Senate, said the government would investigate how Bhutto's name was excluded from its advertisements for International Women's Day, the daily said. Faraz acknowledged that Bhutto gave unparalleled leadership to women and said the services of the first woman prime minister of the Islamic world for restoration of democracy were beyond any doubt. He attributed the missing reference of Bhutto from the advertisements to a mindset and promised a probe to find out at which level it had been done. Later, the House passed a resolution commending the role of Pakistani women in nation-building. “The importance of women's day should be realised and the house recommends that concrete steps should be taken for women's empowerment,” said the resolution. The House also had a discussion to commemorate International Women's Day. The latter part of the Senate's proceedings was chaired by Krishna Kumari Kohli, first Hindu woman senator from Thar, during which speeches were made to pay tribute to prominent Pakistani women for remarkable achievements in multiple fields despite all odds and challenges. Kohli expressed her gratitude for being given the chance to chair the session. “I consider myself very fortunate today to be sitting in this seat, I salute Pakistan and I salute Pakistan's people and I am proud to be a Pakistani and only Pakistani,” she said.

The NGO has threatened to launch an agitation if NMRDA issues notice to any structure in Metro Region before doing the same to VCA. President Prashant Pawar said NMRDA should withdraw all notices issued in Metro Region to many people if it doesn’t have the “courage to act against the stadium”. “The public information officer at the collector’s office submitted an affidavit to the state information commission (SIC) in June last year confirming the building plan of the stadium was not sanctioned by the collector. NMRDA still writes a letter to the collector asking whether it has given sanction. Instead of giving a clear reply, the collector replied that NMRDA should take a decision on the building plan,” he said. Pawar added that NMRDA wrote a letter to state’s law and judiciary department to understand if an environment clearance was applicable to the stadium or not. “This was done only to keep VCA’s application seeking completion and occupancy certificate pending. MPCB had already stated that the stadium requires an environment clearance and VCA does not have it. NMRDA should reject VCA’s application immediately and issue notice under MRTP Act,” he said. The NGO told NMRDA commissioner on March 1 that VCA’s application seeking completion and occupancy certificate is pending with itself. “The NMRDA should have stopped VCA from hosting India’s match with Australia,” he said.

C Sridhar, Vellore District Secretary of DMDK, said though some party leaders paid a visit to Duraimurugan for personal reasons, he had made an embarrassing statement that, “DMDK functionaries headed by Murugesan visited his Chennai house to seal an alliance with DMK. However, we had avoided it since DMK had already finalised seat sharing.” Sridhar, who claimed that this statement by Duraimurugan was untrue, said the latter made a disparaging remark against DMDK cadre and leaders.

Meanwhile, a heated argument broke out between police and DMDK cadre after a policeman claimed their protest was merely to grab attention. However, they were later pacified by senior police officers.

Pandey did not join in the protest on both the days. While other MLAs, including cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, camped at the plaza on Friday night, Pandey did not appear even once. It is not the first time Pandey has given a miss to a programme organized by the district Congress leadership, especially MP Ravneet Bittu. At the time MC was about to dismantle illegal structures near Jagraon Bridge for reconstruction, Bittu and other leaders had gone to the area to convince encroachers to leave the place. Even at that time, Pandey did not go to the spot, despite the area being in his constituency. And recently, Pandey also demanded a ticket for contesting the MP elections from Ludhiana constituency. When asked about his absence from the protest, Pandey said: “I did not receive any message from Congress MP Ravneet Bittu to reach there. Moreover, I do not believe in becoming a part of any type of activity that inculcates wrong habits among people.” Bittu, on the other hand, however, said: “The protest was for the cause of public welfare, so MLA Pandey should have come on his own.” He said he had not sent official invites to other MLAs as well. In the protest, Congress MLA from East (Sanjay Talwar), from Central constituency (Surinder Dawar), and Gill constituency (Kuldeep Vaid) had come. But apart from Pandey, even councillors from his group did not go there, except district Congress president Ashwani Sharma. ‘Not informed about budget meeting’ Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey claimed he and his group of councillors were unaware of the MC budget meeting, and were not delivered the meeting’s agenda. He said this is the reason councillors from North constituency did not attend the meeting. On the other hand, MC secretary Tajinder Panchi denied the allegation, and said they had circulated the agenda to everybody before the meeting. ",10 Mar 2019,2019-03-10 00:00:00

However, the parties agreed to accept the request made by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan , who said the current political situation demanded a strong and united fight from the LDF. Sources said leaders of JD (S) and LJD criticised the practice of two Left parties dividing positions among them by leaving democratic parties in the lurch. NCP also demanded a seat.

However, Vijayan, who listened to the criticism, requested all to cooperate with the seat sharing formula. He said all issues raised by the constituents could be discussed after the election. The state committee of LDF then decided to allot 16 seats to CPM and four to CPI. In addition to the 15 seats contested last time, CPM will also contest from Kottayam where JD (S) contested in 2014. Later, LJD state president M V Sreyams Kumar and JD (S) state president K Krishnankutty told reporters that they had conveyed their protests but agreed to the final decision. The JD (S) state executive which met after the LDF state committee witnessed tense moments as a section of leaders questioned the inability of the state leadership.

The cabinet also sanctioned new facilities for Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT). While GB Pant Polytechnic has been functioning in an old building since 1961, the engineering college has been operating out of old hostel buildings with insufficient infrastructure facilities.

In 2017, the students started protesting for a new campus. Many of them even embarked on a ‘sleepover protest’ by staying back on the campus and sleeping in the classrooms. At the NSUT campus in Dwarka, the smart classrooms will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 26.8 crore. Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology became NSUT on September 26, 2018 “to cater to the increased demand of students”. The campus will have 10 classrooms each accommodating 125 students and 250 students, respectively. The institute will also have another building that can accommodate additional 1,500 students.

The five unemployed teachers climbed a water tank in Patiala on Monday evening along with bottles filled with petrol in a protest against the state government. The protestors claimed that they were demanding jobs from the state government after clearing the mandatory exam of the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) as the government promised to provide jobs to those who clear the test. They claimed that despite two years, candidates who cleared the TET exam were without jobs. Deepak Kamboj, president of the ETT-TET-pass unemployed union, said: ""We have cleared the TET exam and the government assured us of jobs after we qualify the test. It has been two years and the government has not provided us with jobs. The government holds job fairs, but has been incapable of providing jobs to the unemployed youth. We meet all the requirements of the job and we will continue with our strike until the state government assures us of providing jobs."" He said the five protestors, who climbed a water tank on Monday, did not come down. The agitation would be intensified if the government failed to pay heed to their genuine demands. PSPCL assures jobs, protesters call off strike A day after seven persons climbed a water tank in Patiala over their demand to get jobs on compassionate grounds, the protestors called off their strike on Friday after they were given assurance in writing by the PSPCL authorities. The protestors claimed that the authorities of the PSPCL had assured them of fulfilling their demands and considering their issues after which the protestors decided to call off their strike. As many as seven persons, including a 60-year-old woman, had climbed a water tank near the 66 KV grid at the Patiala-Rajpura road on Thursday. They demanded jobs on compassionate grounds for the kin of government employees, who had worked in the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) during 2000 to 2010. President of the union Gurpreet Singh said: ""The PSPCL authorities have assured us in writing to fulfil our demands after looking into the documents of genuine cases. Following this, we have ended our strike."" The protestors claimed that they lost their parents or kin during job in the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) that was later dissolved and transformed into two separate boards, including PSPCL and PSTCL, in 2010. They said after 2010, the government started giving jobs on compassionate grounds to the kin of employees, who died during their job, but did not consider cases pending from 2000 to 2010. The protestors said there were around 6,000 persons across Punjab who demanded jobs on compassionate grounds from the PSPCL and the PSTCL. ",09 Mar 2019,2019-03-09 00:00:00

Several social activists staged demonstration in front of the revenue divisional commissioner (RDC)’s office in Berhampur and submitted a memorandum addressed to Governor Ganshi Lal demanding his unconditional release. Many tribals have threatened to demonstrate in front of Kalahandi collector’s office on Friday. Lingaraj, adviser Niyamgiri Surakhya Samiti , a tribal outfight opposed to mining in Niyamgiri, was sent to Bhawanipatna Jail on Wednesday after police arrested him for allegedly possessing arms, supporting the Maoists and mobilising other tribal leaders against mining in Lanjigarh. Theopil Gamang, convenor, Ingenious People’s Forum, a tribal outfit, termed Azad’s arrest as illegal. ""It’s a government ploy to favour certain companies by arresting Azad as he is opposed to mining Niyamgiri. He has been fighting for protection of tribals’ interest,” Theopil said. Prafulla Samantara, an activist who has also been at the forefront of anti-mining movement of tribals in Niyamgiri hills, said it’s a cause of serious concern that the government is trying to falsely implicate Azad as Maoist sympathiser. “It seems, a well-crafted strategy to keep Azad behind bars to kill the tribals’ movement,” he said. Satya Mahar, the convenor of Niyamgiri Surakhya Samiti said Lingraj was the first person, who had motivated the locals of Trilochanpur to participate in the 2014 election when Maoists had threatened the people to keep away themselves from voting. “How could be Lingaraj linked to Maoists,” Satya asked. The government is trying to supress the tribal voice against the mining, he added. Police sources said Lingaraj was arrested in the wake of DGP R P Sharma directing police to nab the anti-socials, Maoists sympathisers and other disturbing elements before the general elections-2019. Additional SP of Kalahandi, M K Mohanta told the reporters in Bhawanipatna on Thursday that Lingaraj was arrested in two different cases. Police said, Lingaraj along with tribals had agitated and threatened in front of Vedanta gate for which Vedanta security head, Rajiv Ranjan had lodged an FIR against Azad and his associates in 2017. In 2019, Bijepur police station, ASI-Tankadhar Budhia, had registered another case against Lingaraj and four other tribal leaders for holding rallies and threatening the police against setting up of proposed CRPF camp at Trilochanpur. State co-ordinator of SC, ST, OBC and minority Sangram Samiti, Satyabadi Naik said Lingaraj peacefully protested against the CRPF camp bcause the jawans forcibly acquired the panchayat building of Trilochanpur in the name of proposed construction.

The university has hiked the annual fees for the MBA courses from Rs 74,200 in the academic year 2018-19 to Rs 1.66 lakh in the academic year 2019-20. “The fees for all the MBA courses have been increased by 125% without any contemplation. The university doubled the fees for MBA courses. Certain fees such as amenities development fund, industry-interface fund and placement assistance fund that were paid by students only once during the admission have now been made yearly. Moreover, the university has also hiked the fees under these heads,” said SFI, Pondicherry University (PU) chapter secretary Abhijeet Sudhakaran said. The students’ forums argued that the exorbitant hike in fees structure will deny the opportunity of the students from the poor economic and social background from pursuing higher education. “We strongly oppose this huge increase in the fees and view it as an anti-student move. SFI demands immediate revoke of the fee revision,” said SFI-PU president C P Uvais. The university sources said the academic council and executive council have given the approval to hike the fees for all the courses from the next academic year. “The university decided to hike the fees for all the courses (not only MBA courses) from the next academic year. The school of management was the first to commence admission for the next academic year and the prospectus for the MBA courses furnished the revised fees structure. The revised fees structures of other courses will be furnished as and when the respective departments release admission notification and issue prospectus,” said a university official. Another official said the university hiked the fees last time in 2012-13. “It is almost seven years since the fee structure was revised. We revised the fee structure keeping in mind all the necessary factors. Moreover, the support from the funding agencies has been dwindling over the years,” said the official. However, the students’ union leaders argued that hike in certain heads of the fee structure was exorbitant. “For example, the alumni association fund was hiked from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000, additional lab facility fund from Rs 200 to Rs 5,000 and tour and industrial visit fund from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 among others. We have submitted a memorandum to the university registrar urging the university management to withdraw the hike in fee structure,” said Sudhakaran. ",08 Mar 2019,2019-03-08 00:00:00

Residents have been demanding supply of Narmada water for almost five years. IMC had planned for a function in April for inauguration of the tank. Officials said that supply was started on trial basis and it would take another month to start regular supply. “The supply was delayed due to pipeline installation work. Some of the lines have not been connected. We aim to finish work by end of the month and regular supply would be started by then,” said Sanjeev Shrivastava, an official with Narmada Project. “We have not finalized date for formal inauguration of the tank. There will not be any delay in commencement of supply even if a function is organized,” he added. The protest started at around 9.00am and lasted for an hour. A team of civic body and Narmada project officials reached the area and convinced residents to withdraw the agitation on assurance of starting regular supply soon. The residents complained that supply line was installed in the area in 2013 and IMC has not been able to start supply even after five years. “We had been demanding for supply for almost three years. But corporation officials were not bothered about it,” complained Sanjay Parihar , a resident of the area. He alleged that civic body has already completed testing eight months ago, but supply was never started. “Even our borewells have started drying up,” he said. The residents alleged that while construction and testing was over, officials were not starting supply. “They were waiting to host a function to start supply formally while the residents continued to suffer. Even corporator failed to solve the problem,” they alleged. “We were left with no option but to launch a protest forcing IMC to start supply. We hope that supply is not discontinued from tomorrow,” they added. The 30MLD overhead tank was constructed by Indore Development Authority and IMC has installed supply lines.

Though fishing season is on, they said, many of them are forced to stay at home due to the work. The 9.9-km coastal road will link Marine Drive to the southern end of Bandra-Worli Sea Link and include a 6.8km undersea tunnel, which will run from Marine Lines near Princess Street flyover to Priyadarshini Park. Construction started in October 2018 and is expected to go on for the next four years. Nilesh Patil, a traditional fisherman from Worli, said: “If this coastal road comes up...around our traditional fishing belt, we fear we will not be able to find fish in shallow waters.” Fisherman Harishchandra Nakhwa demanded that the work be halted. “We will go in the waters and protest , if required,” he said. On Friday, a report, ‘Social Ecology of the Shallow Seas’ was released which listed the impact of the coastal road reclamation on ‘artisan fishing’, which is done in shallow waters, in the Worli fishing zone. Shweta Wagh, one of the authors of the report, said: “We studied the fishing belt for three months and found that coastal infrastructure projects that necessitate reclamation or such intensive construction activity in the foreshore or nearshore areas will irreversibly damage the coastal ecosystem and thereby dispossess artisan fisherfolk of their traditional occupation...” But BMC chief engineer of the Mumbai Coastal Road project Mohan Machiwal said several studies had been taken up to study the impact of the coastal road on the ecosystem before starting the project. “In February, the high court had asked a meeting be held by the fisheries department and its outcome to be submitted.” Last month, the BMC had decided to appoint the National Institute of Oceanography to study the effect of the project over the sea for the next six years. But Stalin Dayanand from NGO Vanashakti said studies carried out during or after the coastline is damaged are of no use. ",09 Mar 2019,2019-03-09 00:00:00

Montu Dutta, in his 40s, was disturbed over speculation that his party, AGP, may renew ties with BJP before the Lok Sabha election. While it seems like a distant possibility at the moment, Dutta was miffed. ""After BJP stabbed us in the back by introducing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, the people of Assam are left with no choice but AGP. If AGP also deserts us and takes side with BJP, the people will feel betrayed. AGP's grass roots workers are restless and will be more than a little disappointed if it decides to return to BJP,"" Dutta said. Around 10am on Thursday, he got to the AGP office at Ambari here with a lock and shut the gates. AGP office-bearers were at work inside the building then. After half an hour of arbitration, Dutta relented when AGP members promised to take up his grievances with party heads. In January, AGP had walked out of its partnership with ruling BJP after the Union cabinet made it clear it intended to push the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill through Parliament. The bill, which proposed citizenship for non-Muslim migrants from Bangladesh , Pakistan and Afghanistan, would go against the regionalist agenda the AGP has built its political capital on for more than three decades now. AGP spokesperson Manoj Saikia denied Dutta was associated with the party and, instead, said such anger is an evidence of the ""attachment"" people have with it. ""People of Assam have faith in AGP. Such anger shows people's support and emotional connect with the party, We want to assure people that we will act only with the indigenous people's interests in mind,"" Saikia said. The party is yet to take a call on any alliance formation for the Lok Sabha election. ""We have been seeking feedback from our party members. We have not yet decided if we want to ally with any party,"" AGP president Atul Bora said. Congress has been courting AGP since its breakup with BJP, with former CM Tarun Gogoi also backing the idea. Sources within the party indicated that it has been looking for partners backing the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord. ",08 Mar 2019,2019-03-08 00:00:00

With their 12 tractor-trolleys parked at the entry point, the protesters were denied entry to Chandigarh. While they released 15 stray dogs — who were caught from near Mohali’s Daun village and packed in a vehicle — at the boundary of the township, cattle loaded in two of the 11 vehicles were let loose some metres away at a ground in Phase VIII. Later, the rest of the cattle in nine tractor-trolleys were shifted to the Mohali administration trucks. Each vehicle had about 10 cattle. The farmers presented a memorandum to officer on special duty (OSD) to chief minister Sandeep Brar. Brar said, “We have accepted their memorandum. We will arrange for a date to have a dialogue with the CM.” Ajmer Singh Lakhowal, who led the activists, said, “Stray dogs are killing children and elderly in villages. Stray cattle are destroying crops, putting farmer in debts. But the government is not taking any action.” Earlier, the protesters started gathering at Amb Sahib Gurdwara around 10am. At about 3pm, 600 farmers, followed by 12 tractor-trolleys, marched towards the ground opposite the gurdwara.

Lakhowal said, “We wanted to release the strays in Chandigarh, but were not allowed to enter it. Therefore, we released them near the border.” The Chandigarh-Mohali entry road was closed due to the protest, as the UT police had sealed the border near YPS crossing. The farmers threatened to hold a similar protest if the menace was not checked. Next time, they warned, they would release stray dogs and cattle outside the houses of the CM and bureaucrats in Chandigarh.

The farmers had lifted 15 dogs from near Daun village in Mohali and released them at the Mohali-Chandigarh border. When asked about the Act, the farmers said they do not care about guidelines that protect animals who kill humans. Hira Singh, a farmers, said, “Stray dogs have been killing infants, children and the elderly in Punjab. But the government is protecting dogs instead of humans. If a lion turns a man eater, he is killed. Here, stray dogs have mauled several people to death in the past few months, but the government has failed to act.” They said recently, a pack of stray dogs had mauled a toddler to death near Rajpura and killed an 80-year-old woman near Moga.

As she felt labour pain, she was admitted at the Tirupur GH on Tuesday morning,” S Thangaraj, 29, of Sri Nagar in Angeripalayam, said. “At first, a duty doctor informed us that it would be normal delivery but an hour later, my permission was sought for performing caesarean. We said fine but in the same evening, baby boy was born in normal delivery,” he said. “Even without showing the newborn to us, the 26-year-old woman was admitted in neonatal intensive care unit. The doctors informed us that baby was suffering from asphyxiation. During evening hours on Wednesday, the baby was declared dead,” he said. “While there was no alarming medical history involved throughout the pregnancy, how the baby would have died after being born in the normal delivery. If there was any complication in the delivery, they should have done the caesarean. Negligence and improper care shown by the doctors and paramedical staff costed our baby’s life,” he added. Around 10 people including the baby’s father sat in front of the main building and protested by refusing to receive the baby’s corpse. A health department official held talks with the protesters. A senior health official said, “As the baby’s head was ready at brim for coming out, we earlier wanted to perform normal delivery, but the decision changed when it seemed complicated. But again, the situation progressed, so the normal delivery was conducted. However, the baby died unfortunately due to asphyxiation. There was no negligence from our part at all.” ",07 Mar 2019,2019-03-07 00:00:00

The aggrieved parents of the 46 affected students demanded that their wards should be given hall tickets and allowed to appear in the Class X and XII exams which will start from Thursday. With tempers rising and the protest turning aggressive, the police had to be called to ensure law and order. Protesters locked the DEO’s office and did not allow officials to go out. A Class XII girl broke down amid the protest and said, “I don’t know what to do now. After preparing hard for the exam, I am now going lose one year!” A worried parent echoed the girl’s fears about the students’ future and said, “We want the education department to take some action and save students’ academic year.” The school was derecognized in 2016 after GSHSEB found rampant irregularities in the school’s functioning, including hiring of unqualified teachers, making students of different classes sit in one room and showing a playground that did not exist, sources informed. Despite the school approaching the high court seeking relief for its board examinees, the board refused to allow the students to sit for the exam.

"MLA disqualified, Congress protests in Kutch","MLA disqualified, Congress protests in Kutch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/mla-disqualified-congress-protests/articleshow/68294908.cms,en,"AHMEDABAD: The Congress party took to the streets across the state on Wednesday, protesting against what it termed as blatant misuse of power by the BJP in disqualifying Congress MLA Bhagwan Barad, who has been convicted in a 24-year-old illegal mining case. The BJP countered the protests, asking whether the Congress was protesting against an order of the Supreme Court or supporting the illegal mining for which its MLA has been convicted. Dharnas were staged by party workers at all district headquarters in the state, after which Congress workers handed over memorandums to the respective district collectors. Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, “The BJP wants to hold on to power through intimidation and by creating fear among opponents. Several BJP leaders have been convicted in the past for serious offences, but no action has been taken against them.” Countering the allegation, BJP leader Bharat Pandya asked if the Congress was protesting against an order by the Supreme Court or whether it was supporting the act of illegal mining by one of its MLAs. “The MLA has been disqualified according to an order of the Supreme Court and notifications by the Election Commission. The Congress is not staging dharnas against terrorism or paying tributes to the soldiers who died in the terror attack, but is supporting illegal mining by staging dharnas,” he said. The Congress is up in arms because it has lost three of its MLAs in the past few months, bringing down its tally in the Gujarat assembly from 77 to 74, while the BJP tally has crossed the psychological three-figure mark. Quite simply, the BJP is slowly but surely chipping away the Congress base with the aim of repeating its 2014 general election results, when it won all the 26 lok sabha seats in Gujarat. In fact, top ruling party ministers and leaders have been openly saying that all disgruntled leaders from the Congress are welcome to join the BJP. In July, OBC strongman and Congress MLA from Jasdan, Kunvarji Bavaliya, had quit the party and joined the BJP. In the bypoll held in December, Bavaliya won on a BJP ticket. Last month, Asha Patel, Congress MLA from Unjha had quit and joined the BJP after a few days. And on Tuesday, Congress MLA Bhagwan Barad from Talala was disqualified by the assembly Speaker. Clearly, the move to win Kunvarji Bavaliya over turned out to be a political masterstroke for the BJP. The Koli community-dominated Jasdan constituency had always remained elusive for the Bharatiya Janata Party . It could not wrest this seat from the Congress even when Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat. Interestingly, Bavaliya was made minister in the Vijay Rupani cabinet within hours of him resigning as MLA of the Congress party in July 2018. Asha Patel too was closely associated with Hardik Patel’s Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and she had defeated BJP bigwig Narayan Patel in the 2017 assembly elections by a margin of 20,000 votes. Interestingly, it was the first time since 1972 that the Congress had won this seat in north Gujarat. ",07 Mar 2019,2019-03-07 00:00:00

Tiny Israeli sect protests Jerusalem cable car plan,Tiny Israeli sect protests Jerusalem cable car plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/tiny-israeli-sect-protests-jerusalem-cable-car-plan/articleshow/68299528.cms,en,"JERUSALEM: A tiny religious sect is emerging as a major impediment for a controversial plan to connect modern Jerusalem and its historic Old City with a cable car network. Other objections from Palestinian residents, environmentalists, urban planners and archaeologists have so far been unable to halt the project. But the Karaite Jewish community's concern that the cable car will desecrate its ancient cemetery may provide the biggest hurdle of all to government planners. Israel's Tourism Ministry, along with Jerusalem city officials, proposed the cable car as a solution for ferrying tourists over traffic-snarled city streets and steep hills to the iconic walled Old City. The route would start near the ""First Station,'' a renovated old railway station that's now a popular pedestrian mall, and soar over the biblical Valley of Hinnom, to Mount Zion and the outskirts of the Old City, 2 kilometers (1 mile) away. In Jerusalem , a city with over 3,000 years of history, virtually any development project can be contentious. New construction often grinds to a halt after an incidental discovery of antiquities and archaeologists are brought in to salvage ancient remains. After weighing various options for the cable car , planners chose the route as the most sensitive way to leave the city's historical treasures intact. But they apparently were unaware of the Karaite cemetery. ""They're coming and trampling an entire community of 40,000 people and erasing them, not paying them heed,'' said Avi Yefet, a member of the Karaite community. Opposite Jerusalem 's Old City walls, the grassy one-acre plot is still actively used by the Karaite community. Some tombs date back 2,000 years. Standing amid the wildflowers and lush grass surrounding the grave of his great-great-grandfather, once the head of Jerusalem 's Karaite community, Yefet said he doubts the cable car plan will go through. He is all for modern development, he said, but not at the expense of his heritage. The Karaites emerged as a distinct community within Judaism in the early 9th century, interpreting the Hebrew Bible in a more literal fashion and rejecting rabbinic Jewish tradition codified in the Talmud, seen by most observant Jews as the main source of religious law. Consequently, their customs differ from mainstream Jewish practices: Judaism is passed down through the father, not the mother. They strictly adhere to laws of ritual purity and observe holidays according to sighting of the new moon. Today, Israel 's Karaite community is based in Ramle, just outside of Tel Aviv , where their main synagogue is located. An estimated 500 families also live in Jerusalem , home to a medieval Karaite synagogue. Though they serve in the Israeli military and consider themselves Jewish in every respect, they face constant friction from Israel's rabbinic authorities when it comes to marriage, divorce and kosher slaughter. ""Karaite Judaism preserves the oldest conception that most closely resembles the Second Temple era,'' said Shlomo Gaver, director of Israel's Universal Karaite Judaism organization. The Karaites said the Jerusalem Development Authority, one of the government organizations responsible for the Jerusalem cable car project, contacted them last August and proposed covering the cemetery in order to accommodate observant Jews who are ``kohanim'' _ descendants of priests from the ancient temples in Jerusalem who cannot enter cemeteries out of concern for ritual purity. ""According to Karaite religious law, any covering over a cemetery invalidates the cemetery,'' said Gaver. ""Every member of the community feels personally insulted.'' ""Nobody asked or was concerned whether it was a problem according to Karaite law if they were to build something over the cemetery,'' said Rom Golan, the Karaite community's attorney. ``When we explained it was impossible according to religious law, we stopped hearing from them.'' The Tourism Ministry referred questions to the development authority, which said the planning process was conducted with transparency but that ``unfortunately, the Karaite representatives chose to unilaterally stop the meetings.'' ""We would be happy if they would choose to, once again, conduct a deep and thorough discussion of the possible solutions to their matter,'' it added, without saying whether the project will proceed. The government says the $55 million cable car project will make it easier for tourists to reach key religious and archaeological sites. The ministry submitted the plan to Israel's National Infrastructure Committee, and the public has until April 3 to present objections. The Karaites are just one of several groups opposed to the project. The planned route also passes through a national park and crosses from Jerusalem 's western, Israeli side, into east Jerusalem . Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, a move unrecognized by most of the international community. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as capital of a future state and view the cable car project as another move to permanently bind east Jerusalem to Israel. The planned route would also be built over the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan. Critics including archaeologists, architects, environmentalists, Palestinian Jerusalemites, and religious communities contend the cable car will be an eyesore that will detract from Jerusalem 's unique landscape and damage historic remains. The Israel Association of Architects and Urban Planners penned an open letter in October criticizing the utility, aesthetics and value of the project. ""Nowhere in the world is there a precedent for something like this, in which a historic city hands over part of what is recognized as a historical and heritage site for a development of the kind proposed,'' the organization said. The Karaite community has called for an alternative route, saying the project would inflict ``grave harm to the Jewish Karaites, the grounds of the cemetery, and the grieving families of the dead both past and future.'' For the Karaites, who say they face constant marginalization by Israel's Rabbinate, protecting their cemetery is another uphill battle. ""We feel as though we always have to chase, chase, chase in order to realize our basic rights as citizens,'' said Gaver. ",07 Mar 2019,2019-03-07 00:00:00

The protesting leaders later courted arrest and were taken to the police station. The leaders demanded that the chief minister should ask Ashu to resign, who should be booked for promoting corruption and threatening officials. Senior AAP leader and Leader of Opposition (LOP), Harpal Singh Cheema while addressing the gathering alleged that the state government was entrenched in corruption with its ministers indulging in open loot and thus making a mockery of the law. Climing that people in Punjab and his party would not accept such malpractices, he demanded that the the chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh should immediately sack the tainted minister to re-instill a semblance of peoples’ faith in the established democratic system. He also alleged that the Captain government had left its predecessor SAD-BJP government far behind in the corruption. Other prominent leaders who joined the protest included Deputy LOP Sarvjit Kaur Manuke, MLA and chief of the party’s core committee, principal Budhram, Kultar Singh Sandhawan (MLA), Manjit Singh Bilaspur (MLA), senior leader Suresh Goel, Malwa Zone-1 chief Gurdit Singh Sekhon, district president Daljit Singh Bhola, senior leader Ahbaab Garewal, and Aman Mohi, besides others. Deputy leader of opposition Sarvjit Manuke said that the local MLA and the minister Ashu had been hogging the limelight for all the wrong reasons and was deeply involved in corruption. “His role in the scam became even clearer from the audio clips showing the minister threatening the investigating officers that had gone viral on the social media platforms.” She added that the issue was raised in Vidhan Sabha during the recently concluded Budget session, and the members even staged a walk out but the government has failed to take any concrete action. “This points towards the government’s ‘non-serious stance’ on the issue that had rocked the House for days,” she said. Kotkapura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan added that despite assurance by CM Captain Amarinder Singh on the floor of the House, ‘nothing concrete’ had come out of the narrative, as “he neither sacked Ashu nor ordered an inquiry into the entire scam.” Others who were present during the protest included Rajinder Pal Kaur Sheena, Master Hari Singh, Gurjit Singh Gill, Dr Tej Pal Gill, Ravinder Pal Singh Palli, Punit Sahni, Sahil Goel, Sonu Katyal, Harnek Sekhon, and Nanak Singh. As AAP leaders were protesting against the cabinet minister, mayor Balkar Sandhu was seen convincing the leaders, including deputy LOP Manuke to call off the protest. Meanwhile Ashu was in Chandigarh on Tuesday said the protesters have been politicising the issue without any proof. ""If CM has said anything in assembly it has some meaning. The opposition parties are raising hue and cry over nothing. If they have some substantial proof they should make it public instead of doing such protests. Probe will make everything clear,” he said.

Before the arrest, BJP staged a massive protest in Ramdurg on Saturday and MP Suresh Angadi at SP’s office on Sunday demanding Shafi’s arrest.

How did over 500 workers gather within a few minutes of the Facebook post and shout slogans against him and Shafi, he asked. Pattan alleged that BJP MLA Mahadevappa Yadawad and his workers had caused a communal disturbance in Ramdurg on Saturday and urged police to take action against them. He said he and Benne would file separate complaints against the MLA and other workers who called them anti-nationals. “My father and mother were freedom fighters.

Over 300 auto drivers participated in a ‘dharna’ organised by the auto association at Parade ground to highlight their plight which is directly affecting their livelihood. They demanded the regional transport authority and government to immediately withdraw the ban on Diesel Auto registrations. In Dehradun , there are approximately 2,300 registered auto-rickshaws out of which 1,100 autos are diesel - which remained stranded for almost half of the day on Tuesday giving a tough time to the commuters. “I could reach office around 12 pm on Tuesday as there was an acute shortage of public vehicles. The situation was better in the evening though,” said Simmy Karanwal, a banker. The state government, last year, placed a ban on diesel autos plying on city roads and replace it with battery operated vehicles and LPG fuel to minimise pollution. According to Doon Auto Rickshaw Union, the legality of this decision is questionable and discriminatory. Pankaj Arora, a leader of Doon Auto Rickshaw Union, said that the government has taken no action against diesel cars which are far more in number than the autos. “Latest BSIV diesel autos are considered to be as clean as LPG autos. There are hardly 1,100 diesel auto-rickshaws in the city which have been banned. However, there are close to a lakh diesel cars against which no action has been taken. Large eight seater diesel autos and four wheeler commercial passenger vehicles which do not have city permits are plying inside the city area without any action being taken against them. This is injustice,” he added. He further alleged that it seems that the decision is taken due to some vested interests. “At the same meeting where Regional Transport Authority (RTA) had banned diesel auto-rickshaws, 170 odd permits were issued to Small 4Wh Diesel Passenger commercial vehicles, but fresh and replacement permits of diesel 3+1 autos have been banned,” he added. Vinay Singh, an auto driver, said that the RTA’s decision is discriminatory and acting against auto-rickshaws which offer economical public transportation to the common people. “This decision looks one-sided and taken only against diesel auto-rickshaws where there are a lot of other diesel vehicles freely plying in the city and creating more pollution than our autos.” ",06 Mar 2019,2019-03-06 00:00:00

ABVP members called the move of allowing students in the rally “politically charged” and raised slogans against the school’s management. “We have submitted a memorandum to the district education officer in this regard. Since the students attended the rally in uniform, we want an answer as to why they were at a political rally,” said Krishna Mishra, an ABVP member who led the protest said. He added, “We demand an action against those involved in allowing school students to a political rally.” The school management, on the other hand, rubbished the allegation of political motivation. “I was informally invited to the rally by Congress leaders Prabhakar Tirkey and former mayor Rama Xalxo. Since the students were interested in attending the rally, I allowed them,” principal of the school, Sister Mary Grace told TOI. “The only interest I had was in the fact that Rahul Gandhi is the son and grandson of two former prime ministers. If the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been in Ranchi and I was approached by BJP leaders to allow my students there, I would have happily done so,” she added. Though several reports of alleged action on the school authorities surfaced, education secretary A P Singh clarified that no written complaint reached the department till Tuesday evening. “We haven’t received any complaint yet. There is no regulation that restricts free movement of students after school hours. We do have a restriction on district administration involving school students in events and rallies during school hours to welcome guests.” ",05 Mar 2019,2019-03-05 00:00:00

The general body also okayed Rs50 crore payment to the OCW by diverting a part of the Rs200 crore loan the civic body plans to avail. All Congress corporators and independent corporator Abha Pande objected to the proposals, while BSP and Shiv Sena corporators did not participate in the meeting. The general body also approved an extension of 18 months for completion of the 24x7 water supply project. Under the OTS, NMC will waive off penalty of Rs41 crore levied on OCW for breach of agreement in last seven years. The civic body will also pay an escalation cost of Rs52 crore for 24x7 project. The operator also stands to benefit by over Rs40 crore following a decision to extend performance parameters by three more years, up to March 2022. Thus, the OTS will be of over Rs 123 crore. Apart from Rs50 crore payment, pending bills of Rs24 crore will be released to the OCW soon. Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi said OTS was required to complete the 24x7 water project. “OCW is at fault. NMC also committed some mistakes. Therefore, we came up with the OTS. We have denied OCW’s demand to give exemption from spending Rs111.37 crore under renewal and replacement (R&R). We have also not approved interest of Rs28 crore on cost escalation,” he said. Congress corporators Praful Gudadhe, Manoj Sangole, Sandip Sahare, Harish Gwalbanshi, Kamlesh Chaudhary and others objected to the proposals stating that OCW should be ousted for its failure to complete 24x7 project in time. “OCW’s failure is resulting in supply of contaminated water, unequal distribution, cost escalation, water crisis, inflated bills,” they alleged. Mayor Nanda Jichkar and deputy mayor Deepraj Pardikar directed the NMC officials to solve the issues raised by corporators. Gudadhe said waiving off penalty was an irregularity. “NMC officials had levied penalty as OCW failed to fulfil its obligations as per the agreement. None of the corporators are aware about conditions the OCW has met in last seven years,” he said. Joshi directed the NMC officials to prepare action taken report (ATR) of agreement and table before general body in next meeting. Gudadhe said the ruling party should not hurry in approving the OTS and wait till submission of the action taken report. “Citizens know the reason behind BJP favouring the OCW,” he said. Joshi and former mayor Pravin Datke objected to Gudadhe’s statement and asked to give proof of relations between the OCW and BJP leaders. Pande said, “NMC had not furnished data of tankers being operated by the OCW. Are tankers belonging to some office-bearers being operated by the OCW,” she questioned. Pande’s statement resulted in heated arguments as BJP corporators raised objection and asked Pande to give proof. Sahare alleged that the NMC decided to avail Rs200 crore loan from a particular bank without holding discussions with other institutions despite knowing that this would cause loss to the NMC. Gwalbanshi said instead of taking loan, the NMC should seek grants from CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari. ",06 Mar 2019,2019-03-06 00:00:00

Senior BJD leader and MLA Sanjay Kumar Das Burma, who was leading the protest, sat in front of the meeting venue and raised slogans. Due to the vehement protest, Sinha and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan entered the venue through the second gate amidst heavy security. Das Burma said the BJP-led Centre has announced the formation of South Coast Railway (SCoR) without consulting Odisha. As the Centre has created the SCoR considering the geographical area of Andhra Pradesh, similar demand of Odisha should be considered and Jharsuguda, Rourkela and some other areas should be brought under ECoR, he added. He said people of the state will resort to economic blockade if the Centre does not reconsider Odisha’s demand. Sinha clarified that not even a single inch of railway line in Odisha has been given to the newly-created zone of SCoR. “Odisha part of the Waltair division is with ECoR. We are creating a new railway division at Rayagada by taking Waltair division’s 585 km rail line and adding 363 km rail line of other existing divisions of ECoR. This division will look after the development of railway lines in the backward areas of the state,” he added. When Sinha was asked about inclusion of Rourkela and Jharsuguda part of the state in ECoR, the railway minister said, “Keeping the requirement of Odisha in mind, we will discuss the issue in the future,” he added. He said the Centre has sanctioned Rs 27,000 crore in five years for development of railways in Odisha. Some projects like Khurda-Balangir project are moving slowly due to delay in land acquisition by the state government. “Our work gets affected if land is provided in parts. We still need around 327 acres in Nayagarh district , 2,059 acres in Boudh district, 528 acres in Sonepur district and around 39 acres in Balangir district for the 289-km long Khurda-Balangir new line project,” he added.

Police investigation in the case has already hinted at the involvment of some Dera followers. The residents assembled at the site where the blast had occurred on the Truck Union Road in Maur, where five children and who men were killed. The residents also brought Jaskaran Singh, who had sustained serious injuries in the blast and still is bedridden, to the protest site on a cot. The police not allowed the protesters to go at the rally venue. They accused Jassi of doing nothing to provide justice to victim families. “He is now playing politics as the parliamentary elections are round the corner,” they alleged. In the meanwhile Jassiheld the rally at the Maur grain market and counted out the achievements of the Congress government in last two years. The state government had assured job to a family member of those killed in blast but the jobs were denied to families of four children stating that the families were not dependent on the minor children. At the same time jobs to family members of two persons killed in blast have been provided. The protesters also demanded Rs 1 crore per family as compensation.

The people, who protested on Sunday, belonged to the 11 wards that come under Madurai East constituency. Their MLA, DMK’s P Moorthy, presided over the protest. With the elections around the corner, they said that they needed to bring their needs to corporation’s attention. “We were brought under the corporation in the year 2011, but we do not have any of the privileges that other residents under the corporation enjoy,” said R Pandian, a resident. Even after making many representations to civic authorities to provide them with better roads and potable water, no action has been taken and hence the residents decided to stage a protest. Moorthy said that he had raised the difficulties faced by his people even in the Assembly, but no action was taken. As there is no local body in place, the people must knock on the doors of the corporation office. Areas that come under these 11 wards include Thiruppalai, Kannanendhal, Naganakulam and Annaiyur. As many of the wards lack proper roads, auto rickshaws and cabs refuse to come to their doorsteps to pick them up, said the residents. Now, house tax rates have also been increased and we are now being asked to pay it without being provided with the amenities and it is unjust, they added. There is no underground drainage system and open sewage flows onto the road in many areas. Also, as the roads are in damaged condition, even the private water tankers refuse to come to the areas, the residents said. As there is no pipeline connection, we are forced to purchase water for Rs 10 a pot now and the condition is going to worsen in summer.

Congressman Shafi Benne was at the receiving end of protests by right-wing outfits which demanded his arrest. The man arrested has been identified as Nagaraj Mali, a resident of Kankanwadi in Raibag taluk. Police sources said Mali had a diploma in computers and had stolen Benne’s Facebook password. On Saturday, he logged as Benne and posted pro-Pakistan slogans. Following the post, BJP and other Hindu outfits carried out massive protest rallies in Ramdurg town on Saturday. They demanded that Benne, a close associate of former MLA Ashok Pattan, be arrested immediately. On Sunday, BJP workers led by MP Suresh Angadi staged a dharna in front of the SP’s office in Belagavi. Angadi challenged the SP to arrest “anti-national” Shafi or take a transfer. Following their complaint, Ramdurg police booked Benne for sedition, among other charges. However, they did not arrest him as he said his Facebook account had been hacked. During preliminary investigations, police found that the reportedly offensive statements had not been posted through Benne’s device. The location of the device and the place from which the comments had been posted were different. Police tracked Mali through his handset, which he had used to post the comments. SP Sudheerkumar Reddy said Mali and Benne had been friends but fell out during the 2018 assembly elections due to a financial dispute. Mali was an internet centre in Ramdurg town between 2013 and 2018 which was frequented by Benne. After the elections, Mali shifted to Kankanwadi and was waiting for a chance to get even with Benne, said the SP. Taking advantage of the heightened emotions following the Pulwama terror attack, he posted the comments in Benne’s name in a bid to defame him. Mali has now been booked for sedition and under sections of the IT Act. SP Reddy also hinted at action to be taken against those who liked and shared the objectionable post.

They said the cases were affecting their lives - while one is facing issues in obtaining passport, another one could not renew his gun licence.

They were arrested and released on the same day. Following this, 14 people sat on fast in front of Avinashi new bus stand for 12 days from February 8, 2016, until the government sanctioned Rs 3.27 crore for initiating the project feasibility study. The stir was the turning point for the project, for which chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami laid foundation stone on Thursday. Avinashi police had booked 20 protesters under Sections 147, 188, and 341 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the cases are yet to be tried before the Avinashi judicial magistrate court. “While our demand to implement the project has been accepted, it is unfortunate that the government hasn’t withdrawn the cases against us,” said D Prabakaran, one of the affected. Struggle committee of the project had represented the issue before the higher government authorities many times and though they were promised that the cases would be withdrawn, nothing has happened on the ground. Speaking to reporters, even the CM had on Thursday said “the government would consider withdrawing the cases”. When the issue was raised at the farmers’ grievance meeting on Friday, collector K S Palanisamy had asked the 20 to come for a separate discussion and assured to take appropriate action.

Canada announced on Friday that it would launch proceedings to extradite Meng, the high-profile daughter of Huawei's owner Ren Zhengfei, raising concerns in Beijing, which has been very vocal in protesting her arrest since December last year. Meng was arrested in Canada at the request of the US. China said the case against Meng was an ""abuse of the bilateral extradition treaty"" between Canada and the US. Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said allowing the extradition hearing to go ahead was a ""political incident"". China expressed its ""strong dissatisfaction"" and ""resolute opposition"" to the extradition proceedings, he said. The extradition proceedings of the top executive of Chinese telecom giant Huawei to the United States would set the stage for a lengthy diplomatic wrangle between the three countries. State-run Xinhua news agency reported that China has lodged solemn representation, meaning diplomatic protest to Canada. ""This is a severe political incident. We once again urge the US side to immediately withdraw the arrest warrant and extradition request for Meng Wanzhou and urge the Canadian side to immediately release her and ensure that she returns to China safe and sound,"" Lu said. US authorities filed almost two dozen charges against Huawei, the world's second largest smartphone maker, and Meng in January, along with a formal request for her extradition. The charges include bank fraud, obstruction of justice and theft of technology. Huawei and Meng have both denied all the allegations. Canada's justice department had until Friday to decide whether or not the extradition case would proceed in Canadian courts. That decision was based on whether the request complied with the requirements of the US-Canada extradition treaty, and could not be refused if so. For China Meng's case came at a politically and economically sensitive time. The announcement coincided with China kicking off its annual political season with its rubber stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC) and the China People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). About 5,000 delegates mostly members of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and other nominated members would deliberate in the next 10 days about critical national issues.

The students alleged that when they have worked hard to clear the first-year exam and even completed the second-year, then they should not be forced to re-appear for the first-year exam again. TOI had earlier reported that the committee constituted by the state government, on the orders of Supreme Court, to adjust the students of SSSMC in private and government medical colleges in Uttarakhand, had finalised the criteria regarding how the students will be adjusted in five institutions of the hill state. The committee had stipulated that even second-year MBBS students will have to reappear for the first-year exam. Talking to TOI, a second-year student of SSSMC said that all of them had got admission in the college on the basis of their NEET scores. “We studied hard and appeared for first-year exams in 2017. This year we were supposed to appear for our second-year exams. If the government, MCI or Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Uttarakhand Medical Education University (HNBUMEU) had issues with our education and exams, they should have informed us about it in 2017 itself. Why have they wasted two precious years of our education?” he added. “How will we be able study for two years’ course in a month?” said another student. Talking to TOI, vice chancellor of HNBUMEU, Dr Hemchandra Pandey who is heading the committee formed by Uttarakhand government in Subharti case said, “The committee in its report has maintained that the shifting of students will be on the basis of marks obtained in NEET for transfer to government colleges. Those with lesser marks will be shifted to private colleges. It also retained the orders of the Supreme Court which said that the second-year MBBS students will also have to appear for the first-year exam after admissions.” He added that the students of second-year will have to re-appear in exams till they receive further guidelines from the government. To recall, the Supreme Court in December last year had ordered the Uttarakhand government to admit 150 students of MBSS first and second year course of SSSMC in other government and private medical colleges across Uttarakhand.

The farmers were upset that no government official had come on the ground to assess the damage caused to crops. Farmers of Sundarpur village in Sadar sub division claimed the 40-minute hailstorm totally ruined their entire crop of wheat, mustard and potato. “It has been two days but not even a lekhpal has come to assess the loss we suffered due to the natural calamity on February 27. We are worried as we have no idea how we will be able to recover our losses. Being neglected by administration, we had to come at district headquarters to raise our problems before the district magistrate,” one farmer said. Since DM VK Singh was away to Lucknow to participate at a meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner, additional district magistrate (finance and revenue) approached the farmers and assured them that they would send a report to the government regarding crop damage. Manoj Kumar Pandey, ADM, said, “We are conducting a survey to assess the damaged crops. It takes a minimum of 40 hours to complete the survey across the entire district. Once the survey is completed, we will send our report to the government.

In a teleconference on Friday, Naidu said he had written a letter to the PM to highlight the Centre’s discrimination against the state. He had never compromised on the state’s interests. “The Centre resorted to cheating while carving out the new railway zone at Visakhapatnam. The zone was created without revenue. This shows the arrogance of the Centre and deception of BJP leaders,” said Naidu. He said Modi was visiting AP only to humiliate the people of the state. He said except Jagan the entire state was burning with anger against Modi. “Jagan will not break his silence for the sake of state as he knows well that he will be put behind the bars if questioned Modi,” said Naidu. The CM said the Centre had granted Rs.7000 crore for two Metro train projects in Madhya Pradesh and ignored Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam Metros. He said the Centre adopted a partisan attitude even in clearing petro-chemical projects as it put the Kakinada project on hold while clearing the similar project in Rajasthan. He said the PM should explain when the Centre was going to release Rs.12000 crore revenue deficit of the state and Rs.4000 crore dues of Polavaram project construction cost.

Teachers have called it an “undemocratic” step and threatened to launch a door-to-door campaign against the government for trying to stop them from “fighting for their rights” and not meeting poll promises. To prevent teachers from striking work ahead of the exams, Punjab education secretary Krishan Kumar has issued instructions to district education officers to approach their respective civil courts to ensure that teachers joined work.

Sanjha Adhyapak Morcha convener Sukhwinder Chahal termed the decision unjustifiable and said the government was targeting teachers who were fighting for “genuine demands”. “Instead of fulfilling our demands, the government has issued directions for court action against us,” said Chahal. Teachers bodies are scheduled to meet Punjab chief minister on March 5 In past few months, teachers have been at loggerheads with the government over pending issues. Contractual teachers are up in arms over the terms framed for regularisation of their service, or making their employment permanent.

Accusing the BJP of hatching a conspiracy to destroy the railways in Odisha, the BJD said it would stage a dharna in front of the ECoR headquarters here on Saturday. “Creating South Coast Railway (SCoR) with its headquarters at Vishakapatnam was taken by the Centre keeping the elections in mind and to woo the people of Andhra Pradesh. Major assets and part of the Waltair division has been transferred to the new zone, which is yet another anti-Odisha attitude of the Centre,” BJD leader Sanjay Das Burma said. The railways on February 27 announced its decision to create South Coast Railway comprising the existing Guntakal, Guntur and Vijayawada divisions. According to plan, the Waltair division, which was under ECoR, will be divided into two parts. While one part of the Waltair division will be incorporated in the new zone under Vijayawada division, the other part will be converted into a new division with its headquarters at Rayagada under ECoR. State commerce and transport minister Nrusingha Sahu said Odisha would face major infrastructure loss because of the division of Waltair division though it won’t have a major impact on revenue. Maintenance of most diesel and electric engines and almost all wagons are done in Vishakapatnam, where the railways have been investing continuously over the past decade and half. The diesel shed located in Vishakapatnam is the biggest in the country while there is no such diesel engine shed in Odisha. “With these facilities taken away from ECoR, the railways in Odisha will be in a very precarious position as far as supply of engines and wagons are concerned. Now, ECoR will be highly dependent on other railways and will not be able to serve the need of the people and industries of Odisha,” Sahu said. While the BJD described the Centre’s move as anti-Odisha, the TDP claimed bifurcation of Waltair division will cause revenue loss for Andhra. But the BJP said both the BJD and TDP protest against the central move is politically motivated even though carving out a new zone is a win-win situation for both Odisha and Andhra. “The Centre has fully protected the interests of Odisha while giving Andhra a new zone promised to it during the UPA rule,” BJP state vice-president Sameer Mohanty said.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) officials said they were flooded with complaints from people against shelling out more money for fewer channels. While Local Cable Operators (LCOs) have already launched an agitation across the state, consumers are getting ready at the local level to protest the new system. “The Centre must intervene before the situation gets out of control. After sending numerous representations to TRAI, people are waiting for the authorities’ response,” said Shivalinga Patil, president of Naragunda Nagarika Hitha Rakshana Samithi, adding: “A meeting of cable subscribers has been convened next week to discuss the protest plans.” With the regime having rolled out, multi service operators (MSO) have switched off pay channels in most villages. Consumers are getting only free-to-air (FTA) channels along with the default Doordarshan channels. KC Ramakrishnappa, a cable operator from Malur town in Kolar district, who has 800 subscribers, said people are protesting in front of his office demanding their favourite channels back on TV. And they don’t want to pay extra for pay channels. “People are not convinced about the new regime. They ask us what was the need for disruption of a system which had been in place for years. We don’t have an answer,” said Ramakrishnappa. Ramakrishnappa was charging Rs 180 for 440 channels before the new regime was implemented on February 1 (deadline for migration has been extended to March 31). Now, he has to collect Rs 130 (network capacity fee) plus 18% GST, for which a consumer will get 74 FTA channels and 26 mandatory DD channels. If the consumer wants to watch a pay channel, s/he has to pay the maximum retail price (MRP) fixed for the channel, over and above the network capacity fee. For instance, for Colours Kannada, one has to pay Rs 19 plus 18% GST, which amounts to Rs 22.5. If consumers want to watch all channels they were getting earlier, they will end up paying at least Rs 800, considering the MRP of pay channel ranges from Re 1 to Rs 19. “At a time when people are reeling under severe drought and grappling with crop loss, we are forced to ask them to pay more for entertainment,” rued Raju Hiremat, a cable operator from Sindagi in Vijayapura district, who has 1,200 subscribers. He said the government should at least reduce the GST rate from 18% to 5%, while the main demand is to restructure the tariff regime to make entertainment affordable for people, especially in rural areas. “Earlier, the fee structure was differential for urban and rural consumers. The LCOs would collect about Rs 300 in cities like Bengaluru and Mysuru for about 400 channels and around Rs 150 in villages. The government should look at a similar policy,” said Raju Poojari, a consumer activist from Udupi.

The evening meeting, which was attended by four deans, director of students’ welfare, estate officer and student representatives, lasted till 6.30pm.

Both the nurses were hospitalised with serious injuries while one of the protesting nurses who had jumped has been shifted to ICU as her condition is said to be serious. As soon the protesting nurses jumped off the building, they were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The injured nurses have been identified as union President Karamjit Kaur Aulakh and Baljit Kaur Khalsa . A class four employee of government Rajindra hospital was also injured and his leg was fractured as Karamjit Kaur Aulakh had fallen on him. The police and doctors, however, were adamant to reveal the name of the injured employee. The deputy commissioner Patiala Kumar Amit, however, said that doctors at the government hospital had revealed that Baljit Kaur Khalsa was stable in condition. He said that efforts were made to persuade these nurses but all turned futile as nurses threaten to jump immediately whenever the officials used to climb the same building and reach near them. Notably, the nurses under the ‘Punjab Contractual Nursing and Ancillary Staff’ union were sitting on the protest at government hospital since February 6 while few of these nurses climbed to the building but the number declined to two nurses sitting atop after others were fallen ill one by one. The protesting nurses had announced to jump down from the building around ten days back following which the police and the district administration came on its toes and had installed the mattresses and net to catch the nurses in case they jump. These nurses were promised a meeting with the Chief Minister that was scheduled for February 28. ON Thursday, these nurses had jumped after their talks with the Brahm Mohindra turned fruitless. The protesting nurses under the Punjab Nursing and Ancillary Staff Union also claimed to have met the former Union Minister Preneet Kaur who is also the wife of Chief Minister but all in vain. Sandeep Kaur Barnala , said, “The chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh reached his hometown thrice during out protest but did not even made attempt to meet us instead he dilly dally the matter.

Cabinet Minister Brahm Mohindra claimed that the meeting with the CM will be possible next week only. We had end the hunger strike earlier on the assurance of the cops that the CM would meet us. We have been demanding regularisation from last couple of years and the governments befool us before elections by making a false promise but do not regularise us which is our right” Some of the cops nearby had been claiming that the net was not properly installed and was not enough to catch both the nurses in case they jumped together. On Thursday, the net immediately was torn after one of the two nurses had jumped. Since their protest, these nurses had blocked the traffic by sitting on a protest either near the city bus stand or YPS chowk while many times they had marched towards the CM residence but police foiled their all the attempts. A number of officials including SDM, Deputy Commission, SSP Patiala, the health secretary, and others had made efforts to persuade the protesting nurses but they had refused to come down from the government building. In the beginning week of their protest the nurses had kept the Operation Theatres and OPD of the government hospital locked for three days in protest and thus leaving the patient in lurch too. Meanwhile, Bholath MLA Sukhpal Khaira criticised the state government for not regularising the nurses who have been protesting from last one month. He said that Punjab Ekta Party criticise the apathetic and insensitive attitude of the government towards these nurses. He demanded from the CM that besides providing free medical aid and compensation to these nurses, the government should immediately regularise their services. ",28 Feb 2019,2019-02-28 00:00:00

The Supreme Court in December last year had ordered Uttarakhand government to shift the medical students of SSSMC in government and private colleges of the state. Even after the submission of the final report by the committee set up by the government on how these students will be adjusted in state colleges, the government’s approval is still pending. Annoyed with the delay, a group of SSSMC students have submitted a memorandum to the director general of medical education of the state seeking help in the matter. The students claimed that their future is in the lurch as they have already wasted many months and that the government was not even starting the counselling process. A second year MBBS student of the institute on the condition of anonymity said, “The government is playing with our future. Our future is already in a mess and they are unnecessarily delaying admissions.” TOI, had earlier this month, reported that the committee constituted by the state government, on the orders of Supreme Court to adjust the students of SSSMC in private and government medical colleges in Uttarakhand had finalised the criteria on how the students will be adjusted in five institutions in the hill state. The committee also maintained that even second year MBBS students have to appear in first year’s exam once again. The committee in its report has said that the shifting of students will be on basis of better marks obtained in NEET for transfer to government colleges and those with lesser marks will shift to private colleges. It also retained the orders of apex court which has said that the 2nd year students will also have to reappear in first year exam after admissions. Talking to TOI, Hemchandra Pandey, vice-chancellor of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Uttarakhand Medical Education University who is heading the committee formed by Uttarakhand government in Subharti case said that the delay is happening because of SSSMC administration and not from the side of state government. “We have asked for the list of MBBS students from SSSMC administration to start the counselling process but they haven’t provided it yet. We will start the counselling process as soon we get the details of the students,” he added. ",28 Feb 2019,2019-02-28 00:00:00

Carrying placards to educate commuters on the importance of PLPA, the residents claimed they would continue the protest till the government re-notifies the Act in the state. “Our misinformed chief minister on Wednesday said the amended bill was in the interest of the people of Haryana. We completely disagree with his statement as destruction of forests can never be pro-people. The tweaked bill will only benefit a few land owners and farmhouse owners. Unfortunately, the government is not willing to understand people who have bought large land holdings in the forests through fraudulent ways are not economically poor,” said Jitender Bhadana of Save Aravali, an environmental NGO . Protesters also alleged the government didn’t seek public’s opinion before going ahead with the amendment to PLPA. “There has been no public consultation on PLPA. Despite this, the decision is going to impact our ‘Right to Life’ as preserved in the Constitution. The bill is a gross violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, which clearly states no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty,” said Vinita Singh, a resident of Sector 50. Several people from Delhi and other parts of Haryana also joined the protest. “We are concerned about the environment. My 16-year-old son is suffering from multiple respiratory diseases. The situation is already alarming. If we lose the Aravalis, the region will be left with no forest,” said Rhythm Bhatnagar, a resident of Delhi’s Chhattarpur. Siddharth Verma, who reached the protest site from Faridabad, alleged that the Haryana government took the controversial step to appease the real estate lobby before upcoming elections. “I don’t understand how PLPA violates the right of ownership in Haryana, but not in Punjab. The intent is clearly to lure the realtors who eat into the Aravalis and carry out constructions illegally,” he said. The protesters are also using social media and other online platforms to raise their concerns over the threat to the Aravalis in the wake of amendments made to PLPA . “We have been trying to gather support both online too. There are already over 6,500 signatories on change.org to sign a petition against the PLPA amendments. We are also getting a lot of support on Twitter,” said Sanjay Rao, an environmental activist.

They were demanding that Pradhan should not be given the party ticket to seek re-election in the ensuing elections. Congress supporters led by Kali Charan Mallick, the zonal president of the party in Daringbadi block, alleged that the MLA was involved in corruption and people of the area were not happy with him. So he should be denied the ticket to contest again from the same seat, which is reserved for the Scheduled Tribes (ST), he added. They also told the party’s screening committee about it. The committee seeks the opinion of the party’s grassroot workers before shortlisting the probable candidates for different constituencies. Pradhan denied the allegations. “Those who have demonstrated and shouted slogans against me do not belong to the Congress,” he said. Some of them did so out of jealously after I carried out many development works in the area, he added. The MLA said he had made Mallick his representative in Daringbadi block. He is aggrieved because he was removed from the post after I received some corruption allegations against him, said Pradhan. Pradhan, who contested the election in 2014 after quitting his bank job, is also aspiring for the G. Udayagiri ticket this time around. “I am interested to contest again, if the party provides the ticket,” he said.

They are demanding the government to procure their produce on a minimum support price and sell in the market which will be helpful for them to earn profit. Temaram, a farmer participating in the protest, said, “Thousands of tonnes of onions are rotting in the mandi as there is not enough people to buy it and farmers are deliberately running tractors on field as the prices are very low. Last year, we sold our produce at Rs 8 but this year prices are too low. As the region is famous for onions, around 15 years back, an onion market was opened at Rasikhpura. The construction of the market is complete but it hasn’t started yet.” Farmers have also demanded to curb the corruption in the co-operative banks in the state. One farmer said that the attitude of the co-operative bank officials is very lethargic and they have to visit many times to get the work done. “There have been cases in which officials have taken out money for loan waiver in the name of a farmer who was already dead. Officials are earning lakhs from corruption and government is a mute spectator,” said Temaram. By the end of the day collector of Sikar, Naresh Kumar Thakral gave assurance to the farmers that the onion market will be opened within a month and have given orders for the investigation of allegations of corruption. However, for the purchase of onions at minimum support price is a prerogative of the agriculture department, so, he has sent the letter to the department for further consideration. The farmers have decided to continue their agitation further until the minimum support price for their produce is given. ",28 Feb 2019,2019-02-28 00:00:00

The protesters raised slogans against the state government for allegedly ignoring their long-pending demands. Shivram Mhaske, leader of agitating teachers, said that nearly 9,000 teachers have been affected due to an alleged arbitrary decision by the state education department to make TET mandatory from retrospective effect. “The diktat from the education department mandating teachers appointed February 13, 2013 onwards to qualify the TET is highly outrageous. All appointments in question were made as per the laid rules and therefore there is no need for retrospective order,” he said. Stating that the fate of scores of teachers hangs in balance, Mhaske said the government must roll-back its decision related to the TET. When contacted, a senior education department official said the government order in question has a base of judgement issued by the Bombay high court on December 12, 2017 in connection with certain petition in similar dispute. “The roll-back of TET as demanded by a section of teachers will be contempt of court. It is a policy decision to be taken by the state government on how to respond to the demand from teachers,” he said. In accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) has laid down the minimum qualifications for a person to be eligible for appointment as a teacher for class I to VIII, as per which the TET is conducted. The state government had notified the TET through government resolution issued on August 23, 2013. It was made mandatory for teaching aspirants willing to serve in educational institutes of all managements and all mediums, including private-aided, unaided and even self-financed schools. The teachers have also decided to step up their agitation in support of demands related to the release of grants for unaided schools, stating that the annual budget of the state for 2019-20 has no concrete assurance to take care of the same.

Around 10 activists blocked the entrance of University main building on Rabindranath Tagore Marg for over an hour on Tuesday afternoon. This time, NU administration showed unexpected alertness in calling the cops besides reinforcing security by pooling guards from other departments. On February 8, NU had remained mute spectator to rampage by ABVP vandals who damaged property and manhandled women guards. NYC warned of disrupting the conference where Union minister and BJP heavyweight Nitin Gadkari is the chief guest. The activists demanded NU call off the upcoming international conference on 'Redefining environmental governance for smart city ‘ to be held at Guru Nanak Bhavan on March 2 as it would mean politicization of education. Besides Gadkari, several BJP and RSS members are part of the organizing and advisory committees of the conference. During the sit-in, activists raised anti-Kane slogans. They asked why the VC refused to meet them if there was nothing wrong in his decision. The blockade ended when cops escorted all the activists to the VC chamber where they submitted their demands. Tiwari accused Kane of helping BJP leaders in their political campaign ahead of the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections by using students’ money and University space. NYC also questioned Kane’s move to share stage with Manch’s president Kalpana Pande who is an accused in a 2015 bribery case. Tiwari said by neglecting science departments, it is evident the VC was under pressure from BJP-RSS organisations. After the VC refused to cancel the event, Tiwari said NYC would intensify its agitiation against “misuse” of university property. “If Yechury wasn’t allowed, why exception is made for the party in power? How can the VC share the dais with an accused. Kane must resign,” he said. ",27 Feb 2019,2019-02-27 00:00:00

The protest entered the seventh day on Tuesday. On Monday night, students slept outside the Thapar Hall in teeth-biting cold to make their voice reach the authorities. However, the directorate of student’s welfare, dean Post-Graduate Studies, dean College of Agriculture, and estate officer promised to resolve the matter, but students were not satisfied. Student representative Karanvir Singh Sandhu said: “The university culture of PAU has been compromised. A university is supposed to have openness and a certain amount of freedom given to students. Issues regarding prospectus fee of PAU and hike of fee has also come up, and it needs to be addressed. If things continue like this, that day is not far when PAU will restrict its education just to books. Students leading the protest are being targeted and pressurised in one or the other. But we want to state that these things will not stop us from fighting for our rights, and agitating for our demands. And if our demands are not addressed, we will intensify the protest by starting a hunger strike.” Jasreet Kaur, student of B.Sc Agriculture, said: “The voice of students is being suppressed by PAU authorities. Many times, the students have got together for some cause, but all in vain. Hostel gates were shut at 10.30pm on Monday night without informing us, despite the deadline being 11pm, and they threatened to cancel our hostel seats. Authoritatian decisions are constantly imposed on students. There is no representation of students in decisions taken for the students, which is the main cause of this protest.” Gurinder Singh, student of M.Sc Agri-Economics, said: “Take the recent decision of four-wheeler ban. It was observed and brought to the notice of the authorities many times that four-wheelers without PAU stickers were entering the campus. It was also observed that parents of PAU students were not allowed to enter the campus. The ban was just a ban on student vehicles, and not of any visitors, VIPs, government officials, and persons holding gate passes for transit.” PAU vice-chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon said: “While I was entering my office, I met students and told them not to waste time by protesting, and they should go back to their hostels. I will discuss the issues with them but not like this, and told them to call off their protest. They cannot pick and choose the fee structure and other issues. The Haryana government has its own budget and the Punjab government its own. Students cannot compare fee structures randomly. Then, salaries too should be compared. The Punjab government employees are getting better payscales than the employees of Haryana.” ",27 Feb 2019,2019-02-27 00:00:00

In Nagpur, the organization said almost 200 schools were shut to support demands ranging from RTE fee reimbursement to safety regulations. IESA members strongly feel that the government is ignoring smaller single branch schools while encouraging ‘corporate’ institutions to flourish. Nana Satpute, vice-president of IESA, said the current trend could be termed as ‘mall culture’ in education. “These big brand schools are opening up branches in every nook and corner, and thus finishing off stand-alone institutions that have served the community according to its needs,” said Satpute. He compared it with big malls that have forced closure of mom & pop shops which were integral part of the society. “In the smaller independent schools, there is a small ecosystem which represents the community. The school’s trustee or principal, teachers are usually from the same neighbourhood and know the parents well. The community connect is strong between independent schools and the people,” said Satpute. Rajendra Dayma, president of IESA, said, “Our schools need money to survive. We have been giving free admissions right from the start, but the state has not been honouring its side of the commitment. Independent schools require funds to continue being in existence.” Apart from financial threat, IESA says its members also face threat of episodic events. “Political party workers recently attacked a school and its staff in western Maharashtra. In fact, it continues to happen across the state on a regular basis. We want that School Safety Act be introduced that gives strong punishment to those who indulge in such activities,” said Dayma. Monday’s protest was the first step and IESA is preparing for the next show of strength. Dayma said, “We will now start a non-cooperation movement as soon as RTE admissions start. Let the state education department continue with the online applications, lottery and allotment process. And when the list finally comes to us, we will simply not do anything.” Once a student is allotted a seat in a school, the principal gets a message in the online web portal. The principal has three options to click on against every seat allotted. “We can accept, reject (citing reasons) and say student has not approached the school. We won’t click on anything till our entire dues are cleared,” said Dayma. ",26 Feb 2019,2019-02-26 00:00:00

Kamble, after discussions with the chief minister and social justice minister Rajkumar Badole, read out the assurance given under Rule 47 of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Rules, 1960, in the House on Tuesday regarding fulfilling the demands of the hearing and speech impaired people. He said it would be implemented before the ongoing session concluded. The Rule 47 states that a minister may make a statement on a matter of public importance in the assembly with the permission of the Speaker.

Police later caned the protesters. Some protesters suffered injuries in the police action and underwent treatment at the Sassoon General Hospital, but they continued with their protest on Tuesday pressing for their 16 demands. They also sought an inquiry into the lathicharge. The large number protesters communicated with each other in sign language on Tuesday morning, as they waited anxiously for an assurance from the government.

Tension prevailed at the protest site, a stone’s throw away from the police commissioner’s office, as the protesters refused to leave the spot. They remained there till late in the night, demanding that minister of state for social justice Dilip Kamble meet them. “We will not move out until our demands are met with,” said Pradeep More, secretary of the Rajyastariya Karnabadhir Association, a state-level organisation of hearing and speech impaired people that had organised the protest.

The police action evoked a strong reaction from various political parties. Reactions also poured in on social media sites. NCP MP Supriya Sule condemned the police for an “inhuman and insensitive” approach towards the hearing and speech impaired youths. “A government representative ought to have met the protesters to understand their demands and problems. But nothing of that sort happened. No one even cared to look after their issues though they gathered from morning,” Sule said.

The chief minister should resign owning moral responsibility.” City Congress leader Mohan Joshi demanded a thorough inquiry. The protesters claimed that at least 40-42 of their members were injured in the melee. But the police insisted that only two were injured and there was no lathicharge. The police claimed that their personnel only tried to push the protesters back to prevent them from breaking the barricades. Nine policemen, including senior inspector M M Mujawar of the Bund Garden police, suffered injuries, the police said.

Around 200-300 disabled persons and activists of the Prahar Apang Sanghatna had gathered to initiate a demonstration outside the AMC office on Monday morning. The activists wore garlands of carrots as a symbol of protest against the unfulfilled promises of the civic body. The activists said that the AMC has failed to utilize the amount reserved for the disabled as per the Government Resolution (GR) of the state government for the last 6 years, despite several assurances. On January 16, the AMC general body meeting passed a resolution to utilize Rs10.5 crore from the (3% and 5%) funds reserved for disabled persons. The activists had expressed dissatisfaction over the poor allocation of money in the resolution. According to Shivaji Gade, the district chief of the Prahar Apang Sanghatna, the meagre Rs50 lakh allocation towards the grants for the disabled, restriction of benefits to those with more than 80% disability, lack of assurance on provision of housing scheme benefits and allocation of shops to disabled persons, were not acceptable to the disabled. On Monday, MLA Kadu, accompanied by his activists, stormed into the mayor’s chamber while raising slogans. Kadu held talks with mayor Nandkumar Ghodele and municipal corporation officials and presented his objections to the resolution. “The resolution is in contradiction to the government resolution and schemes,” said Kadu. Following the meeting, the civic body agreed to the several demands placed and mayor Ghodele gave the same in writing. The letter stated that the provision towards the disabled in the AMC budget will be increased from Rs50 lakh to Rs2 crore. According to the GR, those with 40 to 80% disability will be provided Rs2,000 per month and those with more than 80% disability will be provided Rs3,000 per month.

Congress to discuss list of LS candidates for MP this week,Congress to discuss list of LS candidates for MP this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-to-discuss-list-of-ls-candidates-for-mp-this-week/articleshow/68158411.cms,en,"BHOPAL: Congress party is seriously contemplating fielding former chief minister Digvijaya Singh from Bhopal Lok Sabha constituency, which the party has consistently lost since 1989. A meeting will be held in New Delhi to discuss candidates for the general elections on March 2. Sources in the state Congress said that Digvijaya Singh is the closest the Congress can get to wrest the constituency from the BJP. “Two sitting ministers from Bhopal are Arif Aqueel and PC Sharma, both known to be loyal to Digvijaya Singh,"" a state Congress office-bearer said. But the choice is between Rajgarh and Bhopal, the former being a seat Digvijaya Singh represented in the Lok Sabha during the early 1990s before he became chief minister of the state in December 1993. Another surprising name that has been recommended for Bhopal is that of Sandeep Dixit, son of former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit. Wife of a former minister of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan BJP government could be fielded by the Congress from Khajuraho seat. Party leaders claimed that the former minister and sitting MLA who shifted allegiance to the BJP in 2014 could return to the party. And his wife is in the fray for Congress ticket from Khajuraho seat. For Indore, minister for sports and youth affairs Jeetu Patwari still seems to be a popular option. A senior Congress leader said that Patwari is willing to contest but chief minister Kamal Nath has instructed that no sitting Congress MLA or minister will be fielded for Lok Sabha. Sources in the party office added that when Jeetu Patwari was denied possible candidature, he asked if his wife Renuka can be fielded. The other names in the panel for Indore are of Satyanarayan Patel, who has contested several times and lost against Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan, state Congress media cell chief and former Mahila Congress national chairperson Shobha Oza and Archana Jaiswal. For Gwalior, the most likely candidate to be fielded is Ashok Singh who contested against Union minister for rural development Narendra Singh Tomar in 2014 and was defeated by approximately 26,000 votes. Congress leaders argued that the margin of Tomar’s victory was not extraordinary despite the Modi-wave of the previous general elections. For Jabalpur , Rajya Sabha MP and eminent lawyer Vivek Tankha is heading the list, though former MLA Neelesh Awasthi, who lost the November assembly polls, is also being considered a good candidate opposite BJP state president Rakesh Singh. Home minister of the erstwhile Digvijaya Singh government, Mahendra Boudh is leading in the panel of candidates for Bhind constituency. Another former minister Rameshwar Neekhra is a prominent name in the list for Hoshangabad, together with former Union minister Suresh Pachauri and former minister of the BJP government who joined Congress in November Sartaj Singh. Former Youth Congress state president Meenakshi Natarajan is likely to be fielded from Mandsaur for the third time, even though she lost the seat in the last general elections. PWD minister Sajjan Singh Verma’s son is a name in the list for Dewas, while stalwarts former deputy speaker Rajendra Singh and former leader of opposition Ajay Singh are both in the race for Satna constituency. The only sure names are that of sitting MPs Jyotiraditya Scindia for Guna and Kantilal Bhuria for Ratlam. Former Union minister Arun Yadav could get fielded from Khandwa, chief minister Kamal Nath’s son Nakul from Chhindwara, while Himadri Singh who lost the bypoll of Shahdol in November 2016 could again emerge as the party’s face for the tribal reserved seat. She lost by a margin of 60,000 votes in the bypoll against BJP’s veteran Gyan Singh. ",25 Feb 2019,2019-02-25 00:00:00

A march and dharna will be held in front of NHAI regional office at Palkulangara on Tuesday. K Ansalan MLA will inaugurate the dharna at 10.30am. Kazhakkoottam-Karode bypass action council patron and former MLA Jameela Prakasham said that the NHAI was doing injustice by denying reasonable compensation for the land owners in villages such as Kottukal, Kanjiramkulam, Thirupuram, Chenkal and Karode. Prakasham said that majority of land owners didn’t receive compensation by the end of 2014, which makes them eligible for compensation under first schedule of the new land acquisition act. The action council has also alleged that the NHAI was harassing them by filing case in high court against the arbitration awarded by district collector. The action council had demanded NHAI to revoke cases filed against them immediately. According to action council chairman V Sudhakaran, the issues began when district administration backtracked from the compensation agreed during the district level purchase committee (DLPC) meeting in 2013. The meeting had announced Rs 5.25 lakh per cent for A category land. Owners of B, C, D and E categories were to get 10% lesser amounts. Though the amount was agreed for Kottukal, Kanjiramkulam and Thirupuram villages, the DLPC didn’t offer similar rates for lands in Chenkal and Karode, which resulted in a tussle between the then district collector and action council. Former district collector K N Satheesh then cancelled the DLPC and arbitrarily fixed the compensation. Following this, A category land owners got only Rs 3.75 lakh. District collector was appointed as an arbitrator when the land owners launched a protest in 2017. Former district collector S Venkatesapathi had announced 15% hike for 165 complainants and district collector K Vasuki announced 50% hike. However, NHAI has filed appeal against this.

People from the affluent class of society live in this locality. The land cost here is very high and it makes no sense to set up an EWS Housing Scheme in such a locality. We have taken up the issue with the AMC in the past who had assured not to set up such a scheme. However, the work for the scheme has suddenly begun and thus, we have decided to protest."" Residents believe setting up of EWS Housing Scheme for lower income groups would only dent the 'reputation' of the area. ""The average cost of land in this area is Rs 1.5 lakh per square yard.

The agitators included students, women , environmentalists and elderly. They discussed the provisions of PLPA, formed a human chain, marched and shouted slogans like “Clean air and water is my right”, “No Aravali , no vote”, “Builder-neta nexus, Hai hai!” and “Stop PLPA amendment”. Environmentalists expressed concern over the Bill not being shared with public or the forest department. Environmental analyst Chetan Agarwal, said, “The proposed amendments are effectively a repeal of PLPA. They seek blanket provisions that exclude PLPA from being applicable to urban areas, and gives the government power to unilaterally restrict its application to any area it wishes. The amendments are sought to be made with retrospective effect from 1966, thereby nullifying protections made under the Act since then. They subvert Supreme Court directives to protect the Aravalis at any cost, and to treat PLPA areas as forests. Instead, the entire Aravalis will be open for real estate development, mining and any other activity the state fancies.” “The language of the draft Bill contradicts chief minister Khattar’s promise to protect Aravalis. We hope the government will examine implications of the amendments, consult experts and citizens within and outside government, on how they also affect forested hills of the Shivaliks around Chandigarh and Aravalis in south Haryana. The 119-year-old Act has served us well. What’s the hurry to amend it without examination and review,” asked Lt Col (retired) Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi, a legal expert and environmentalist. Ecologist Vijay Dhasmana said, “Aravalis act as green lungs for the NCR . They are also critical for recharging groundwater, which is depleting at the rate of 5ft per year in Gurgaon alone. Groundwater extraction in this region is 300% more than recharge.” Environmentalists said the protest will be held every week, till the government takes back the Bill. Jitender Bhadana of NGO Save Aravali, said, “We’ll carry on the protest online and offline . This is one of this region’s most crucial issues. There is a need to spread awareness among people, so that everyone can come together, as destruction of the Aravalis is irreversible, and will impact all of us.” The Haryana government is going to table the Bill in the legislative assembly next week. If it’s passed, it will give a nod to construction activity on thousands of acres that are currently protected as forest land under PLPA. On February 15, TOI was the first to report that the Cabinet has approved the amendment Bill. According to the amendment, Punjab Land Preservation (Haryana Amendment) Act, 2019, areas included under any development plan and under jurisdiction of municipal acts, will be out of PLPA’s ambit. Also, land that is part of any infrastructure like railway, roads, canals, public institutions, government or public establishments, will also be out of PLAP’s purview. The amendment will destroy over 60,000 acres of forests, which is 50% of Aravalis in Haryana, over districts of Gurgaon, Faridabad, Nuh, Mahendergarh and Rewari. In south Haryana, Aravalis are estimated to cover about 1,25,000 acre. As all of Gurgaon and Faridabad fall under master plans, both cities will lose 100% forests to real estate. About 16,000 acre of forest in Gurgaon and over 10,000 acre in Faridabad will open up for construction. The Aravalis is home to south Haryana’s last remaining forests, and an important shield against desertification of Delhi/NCR. It is home to over 400 native tree, shrub and herb species, eight forest ecosystems, over 200 native and migratory bird species, wild animals such as leopards, hyenas, jackals, nilgais, mongoose, civet cats, reptiles and insects.

Members of the Arts Faculty Students' Union (AFSU), Science Faculty Students Union (SFSU) and Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students' Union (FETSU) have been camping outside Ghosh's chamber since Friday evening over a series of demands. They have been demanding punishment of the Trinamool Congress-sheltered students who had allegedly been threatening them of stopping ""all kinds of democratic activities"" inside the university campus. The unions have demanded the university authorities to enumerate the steps taken to raise the issue with the higher education department and what headway has been made so far. ""We will not withdraw the sit-in till we get concrete and definite assurances on these two issues,"" AFSU member Debraj Debnath told PTI. Education minister Partha Chatterjee said Saturday that the students should realise that an election cannot be held in an institution when the Lok Sabha polls are round the corner and the government cannot take a decision on it at this juncture. To this, Debnath said ""We had been waiting for a decision on this issue for long. This government has taken away all our democratic rights in the past seven years"". The three unions have been on a sit-in demonstration since February 19 after a scuffle broke out between two groups of students, who wanted to approach VC Suranjan Das with their demands after the university's Executive Council meeting. While the AFSU and FETSU wanted to place their demands for facilitating election, the Trinamool Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) alleged unlawful activities in the campus on that day. Das, who fell on the ground during the scuffle, had to be admitted to a hospital. Das had said that he felt ""insulted and humiliated"" and was physically heckled by the students which had never happened to him in the past. The All Bengal University Teachers' Association (ABUTA), JU chapter, in a meeting Friday supported the demand of students for holding student union polls but condemned the heckling of the VC.

As they have been receiving sewage mixed water for the past six months, over 50 people staged a protest on Saturday seeking immediate solution. “Even though the color of the water has not changed to brown, it stinks of sewage. We cannot even store the water to use it for other purpose as it stinks heavily,” said N Thangavel , one of the residents. Over 120 families were residing at the street. He said that they have been receiving sewage mixed water for the past six months and they have complained about the issue to the corporation officials multiple times but it was not sorted out. “Every time we complained, corporation officials would dig some random place across the street, check the pipelines and assure us that the problem was sorted out. We believe them only to receive the stinking water during next supply. So far, they would have checked pipelines at least at ten places,” said A Boopathy, another resident. He said that it has become a practice for them to wash all the buckets whenever water is supplied, collect water in one or two buckets, once the sewage smell gets strong throw the collected water and go home. All the families including those who have obtained household water connection, have been collecting water from Kuppanan goundar street which is over 1.5 kilometers away or purchasing water, he explained. While most part of the city has been struggling due to water scarcity, we cannot use the water even though it is supplied once in three to four days, the residents said. Meanwhile, MLA Amman Arjunan who visited the spot to pacify the residents, had assured the residents to resolve the issue within four days and the residents had planned to escalate the issue if it is not resolved within the sought time. When contacted, corporation officials said that the issue was mainly due to leakage in drinking water and sewage connections and they have been working on to find the leakage points. We have started to check the pipelines at multiple points and the issue would be resolved, soon, they added. ",23 Feb 2019,2019-02-23 00:00:00

Internet services in the state capital were suspended and the army was conducting flag marches between Naharlagun and Itanagar in view of the tense situation, they said. Several protesters on Friday night tried to enter the Civil Secretariat forcing police to open fire in which one person was killed, they said. Arunachal Pradesh home minister Kumar Waii said the situation is under control and the state government has deployed all available forces. Protesters had set ablaze 50 vehicles and damaged over 100 vehicles on Friday evening. They also resorted to stone pelting in which 35 people, including 24 police personnel, were injured, police said. They also burnt the offices of All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union (AAPSU) and All Nyishi Students Union (ANSU) here, police said. The AAPSU and ANSU have supported the recommendation of the Joint High Power Committee (JHPC) constituted by the state government on May 1, 2018 to study the issue. Several organisations in the state had called for a 48-hour bandh on Thursday and Friday seeking changes in the proposals made by the government-appointed panel for granting PRC to non-Arunachalees. The Joint High Power Committee, after holding parleys with the stakeholders, has recommended granting PRC to six communities, who are not natives of Arunachal Pradesh but has been living in Namsai and Changlang districts for decades. The proposals have evoked resentment among several community-based groups and students' organisations, who claimed that the rights and the interests of indigenous people will be compromised if the state government accepts them. The recommendation of the JHPC was supposed to be tabled in the Assembly on Saturday but was not tabled as the Speaker adjourned the House sine die Saturday. ",23 Feb 2019,2019-02-23 00:00:00

Police said the agitating families of deceased employees, including elderly women, have been blocking a portion of a road under the City police station. Personnel from the local police station and BSL security team have been deployed to keep the situation under control. A section of the protesters said the management of BSL is yet to provide jobs to dependants of the employees who died on duty at the plant. “Around 990 dependants are waiting for jobs since 1995, but BSL management remained indifferent towards us and failed to offer jobs despite proving apprentice training for 2-3 years,” Sunny Kumar, one of the protesters said. “We have decided to continue our hunger strike till our demands are met,” he added. BSL’s chief of communications, Mani Kant Dhan, refused to comment on the issue. Efforts by the district officials to pacify the protesters went in vain. Health condition of three of the agitators deteriorated, since the protest began on Tuesday, and they had to be admitted to a hospital. Another agitator, S Jafar, said even though BSL provided apprentice training to dependants of the deceased employees, they haven’t offered employment to any of them yet. “Whenever they advertise about a vacancy they set an age limit of 28, disqualifying dependants who crossed the age bar waiting in hope of getting a job after training. The BSL management is intentionally doing this to ignore us,” Jafar said. Members of BMKAS have been frequently staging demonstrations. Earlier in January, several demonstrators were detained and taken to Camp Jail at Mangalam Stadium. They were later released with assurance of negotiations with BSL management. Jafar said “BSL management neither pays heed to our demands nor allows us to meet the CEO for a direct conversation.” ",23 Feb 2019,2019-02-23 00:00:00

The resolution was moved by Aam Aadmi Party’s Laxmi Nagar MLA Nitin Tyagi and adopted by the House after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced his plan to sit on an indefinite hunger strike for full statehood of Delhi. The three BJP MLAs — Vijender Gupta, Om Prakash Sharma and Jagdish Pradhan — had staged a walkout to protest against an AAP MLA playing the audio of a speech made by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “For a better quality of life commensurate with their contribution to the country’s economy… the home ministry must take all necessary legal and legislative steps to declare NCT of Delhi a fullfledged state without further delay; the NDMC area, which is governed by the NDMC Act, be kept under the exclusive control of the central government,” the resolution read. The resolution was moved during the short discussion initiated by AAP MLA Bhavna Gaur. Apart from other MLAs, labour minister Gopal Rai also spoke on the issue strongly advocating the status of a full statehood for Delhi-.Participating in the discussion, Leader of the Opposition, Vijender Gupta, questioned the timing of the resolution arguing that in the current term, the Parliament had its last sitting early this month. “The demand for a full statehood at this juncture is a political stunt. Whenever AAP finds itself in political danger, it raises the demand for statehood,” Gupta said. “There will not be any session of the Parliament before the election now. For what purpose is the Kejriwal government seeking the statehood at this juncture? The Supreme Court has also commented that Delhi cannot be granted statehood.” The resolution questioned how a politically nominated lieutenant governor could act as a “super-boss” of a democratically elected council of ministers in Delhi. “Elected representatives are directly accountable to the voters and are rightly questioned on issues affecting their daily lives,” the resolution read. The resolution also pointed out that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on home affairs, headed by the then chairman Pranab Mukherjee, in its 106th report in December 2003 had strongly endorsed the Bill for Statehood for Delhi, but it lapsed as the Lok Sabha dissolved a few months later and no attempt was made to revive it.

Friday’s incident in Salt Lake came barely 25 hours after a senior citizen lost an arm after being hit by a speeding bus near Bagha Jatin, at the other end of the city, on Thursday afternoon . The conductor of the bus, which cops are trying to track down, initially tried to push Disha Malkhandi and her friends inside the crowded bus, prompting them to protest. The conductor, enraged by Malkhandi’s objections, then pushed her out, causing her to fall face first on the road near CAP Island in Salt Lake. The fall broke her glasses and pierced the skin millimetres from her eyes and the rear wheels of the bus ran over her left foot as she tried to roll out of harm’s way. One of Malkhandi’s friends, Nibedita Banerjee, shouted out, telling the driver to stop the bus. But, as it continued to move, she jumped off the vehicle as it sped away. The other friend, Priyanka, got off at the next stop and ran back. Cops, till late on Friday evening, were yet to track down the bus. “We are waiting for CCTV footage from the area and a formal complaint,” an officer of the traffic wing of Bidhannagar Police said. Malkhandi and two of her friends boarded the bus on route 215A from Sector V a little after 2.30pm on Friday. “The bus was extremely crowded and there was barely place to stand on the footboard. But the conductor kept urging us to go deeper inside. My friend protested when the conductor kept pushing us,” Banerjee later said. “She fell off the bus and, by the time I got off the moving vehicle, blood was oozing out of her left foot,” she added. Malkhandi’s friends pleaded with a rickshaw puller who eventually agreed to take the injured girl to Bidhannagar Sub-Divisional Hospital. A doctor gave her first-aid and bandaged her almost-severed toe with the rest of the foot before referring her to SSKM Hospital. She underwent a surgery there later in the evening. “The big toe was hanging by a vein and there was a lot of blood loss. We applied pressure to bandage the toe with the foot and referred her to a city hospital as she needed specialized attention and an immediate surgery,” a doctor at the Salt Lake hospital said. Doctors at SSKM Hospital told TOI that the toe was not in a position to be salvaged. “The crushed big toe had no muscular support and was attached to the rest of the foot only by a tendon. We have treated the wound and will observe it for the next 48 hours and then do a second surgery to remove the dead tissue. But the toe cannot be salvaged. We will have to conduct plastic surgery on the wounded part,” said plastic surgeon Sandeep Basu. The first-year student of a private varsity in Sector V is a resident of Dasghara, near Tarakeshwar in Hooghly, and stays as a paying guest at Salt Lake’s CG Block. ",23 Feb 2019,2019-02-23 00:00:00

But after demolishing a shop in the locality, the civic body had to halt the drive as residents launched a protest. Members of the KK Pudur Welfare Association had filed a writ petition in the court in 2000, stating that 1km stretch of the 70-Fee Link Road, a part of the designated cart road, was encroached and as a result, emergency service vehicles including ambulance and fire service vehicles could enter the street. HC directed the civic body to evict the encroachments on the government land after providing alternative accommodation to them. “As per the directions, we were ready to allot alternative accommodation to all the 252 families residing at Jeeva Nagar. But only 100 were ready to shift and were given the tokens for the apartments in the housing unit of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) at Keerantham,” a corporation official said. Thought the corporation had identified the number of encroachers and issued tokens about five months ago, the eviction notices were issued only on February 14. The residents were given time till February 18. “We decided to speed up the eviction process after receiving two contempt notices from the court. We are ready to provide alternative accommodation to all the families and will evict them at the earliest,” the official told TOI. But, many residents were not ready to shift. “We have been residing in the locality for over 40 years. When we moved in, the area used to be waterlogged during rainy seasons. There were poisonous snakes everywhere. Several people died due to snake bite. Instead of all that, we sorted out the problems one after the other and laid the road with our hard-earned money,” said Kaliammal, a 70-year-old resident. “When we have been paying all kind of taxes, including the property tax and water tax just like any other resident, why should we leave the houses we built? We are ready to provide space for road expansion but will not vacate our houses.” TNSCB had signed a lease agreement with the residents in the 90s, said Mohammed Irsadh, another resident. “As per the agreement, residents would be provided patta if they paid Rs 2,000 to Rs 8,000 based on the size of the houses. Most of us had paid the amount.” Acknowledging that such an agreement was signed, a TNSCB official said that it was to compensate the amount that they had paid, they were provided alternative accommodation free of cost. “The residents have no other option, but to obey the court order,” he said.

Five years down the line, another Supreme Court order has now raised their concern. As the Niyamgiri tribals get ready to celebrate their two-day annual Niyam Raja Parba, their biggest festival, the mood is rather sombre. Many apprehend they might lose their ancestral homes in the wake of the February 13 Supreme Court ruling which has ordered eviction of more than 11 lakh tribals across the country whose land rights have not been settled by the state governments. The Dongria Kondhs are planning to hold rallies in their region against the apex court order, for which they blame the governments at the Centre and the state. Lingaraj Azad, convenor of Niyamgiri Surakhya Samiti, an outfit fighting for the protection of tribal rights, said if the order is implemented, hundreds of tribals living in the forest land for generations will have to vacate their native place. “After the Niyam Raja Parba ends on Sunday, we intend to start an agitation to press for our rights,” Azad said. He said the central and state governments are to blame for the Supreme Court verdict. “While the state failed to give us the land rights, the Centre did not represent the case properly,” he claimed. The SC has asked states to file their affidavits by July 12 regarding the eviction of those whose applications for land rights under the Forest Rights Act have been rejected. More than 5,000 people from 112 villages have been residing in and around Niyamgiri hills. Official data shows that out of 590 claims over forest rights, only 310 have been considered. Lado Sikoka, president of Niyamgiri Surakhya Samiti said the state government deliberately rejected many claims. “Where will these tribals live if the government evicts them?” Sikoka asked. Sidhartha Nayak, a Bhawanipatna-based lawyer, who has been fighting for the rights of forest dwellers, said the state government lacks sincerity in settling tribal rights under the Forest Rights Act. “The government offered just 10 decimal land to tribals who have been cultivating more than one acre of land. So, many of them didn’t accept the pattas (land records), resulting in rejection of their claims,” the lawyer said. Dillip Kumar Das, who heads an NGO, Antodaya, that works on land rights, said they are planning to file a review petition. T Ashok Kumar, divisional forest officer (south) of Kalahandi, assured that they would review the claims within three months so that those eligible are not left out.

As many as 1,700 teachers were detained and released late Friday evening. Officials of the state education department said almost all primary schools in the state remained closed on Friday because of the teachers’ stir impacting over 60 lakh students. The massive protest by teachers sent the government officials in a tizzy, who are already struggling to deal with strike by GSRTC employees.

It comprises of deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, agriculture minister R C Faldu and education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama.

In the afternoon, teachers’ representatives met government committee following which education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama announced that instead of giving exemption from CCC exam, the government had decided to extend the deadline by one more year. “Issues cannot be resolved by agitation. We had resolved several issues in past by talks. The government is willing to consider other issues too,” Chudasma said. Digvijaysinh Jadeja, president of the Gujarat Rajya Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, said, “Our main demands include implementation of the old pension scheme, separate grade pay for primary teachers, exemption from compulsory clearing of computer (CCC) exams and consideration of fix-pay service period of five years for determining seniority and promotions.” Satish Patel, general secretary of the teachers’ association, said “If our demands are not fulfilled, then we would begin a state-wide agitation.” Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly Paresh Dhanani, also spoke in favour of the teachers and met them. He also urged the government to resolved the issues of the teachers. ",22 Feb 2019,2019-02-22 00:00:00

Speaking to media persons at the party’s headquarters here, a day after the verdict Oraon ruled in favour of the six defected MLAs, JVM-P general secretary Bandhu Tirkey said the judgement was “unconstitutional” and dented democracy in the state. “The speaker’s tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to approve the merger of any political party. Neither does the tribunal have the jurisdiction to approve that a party has been dissolved. It comes under the purview of the Election Commission. The speaker’s judgement was undemocratic and he has lost the moral right to be in his chair,” Tirkey said. Oraon on Wednesday rejected the petition seeking disqualification of six JVM-P MLAs on grounds of defection under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution and validated the merger of the Babulal Marandi-led party with BJP . Alleging that the tribunal had taken an unilateral decision, Tirkey said the party constitution provisions that a merger will happen after consent of the two-third majority of its central committee. “Only two central committee members of our party appeared in the hearings,” he added. Tirkey also added that the EC, while replying to a RTI query in 2016, had stated that it did not receive any proposal on behalf of the JVM-P for a merger with BJP. “The party contested in several bypolls since 2015 and each time, its candidate were given the party’s symbol, the comb. This proves that the party did not merge with BJP. In fact, JVM-P never merged with any party since its inception in 2006,” Tirkey added. When asked about the future of JVM-P’s sitting MLAs Pradeep Yadav and Prakash Ram in the assembly, party advocate R N Sahay said the Constitution provisions that such legislators will not be disqualified. Meanwhile, JVM-P workers burnt effigies of six defected MLAs, chief minister Raghubar Das and speaker Oraon at Albert Ekka Chowk on Wednesday afternoon. BJP had won 37 seats in the 81-member assembly while its ally Ajsu Party party had won five in 2014 state polls. A few days after the Das government took oath on December 28, 2014, six JVM-P MLAs — Amar Kumar Bauri, Randhir Singh (both ministers in the Raghubar Das cabinet), Navin Jaiswal, Janki Prasad Yadav, Alok Kumar Chourasia and Ganesh Ganjhu — joined BJP, taking the party’s strength to 43.

The farmers from various parts of the state were protesting against the banks for acting against them in cheque bounce cases. “We have been sitting on a protest in Ludhiana for the past several days in support of our demands. Around 1,000 cheque bounce cases were prepared by the authorities, and about 350 farmers of the state were issued arrest warrants in such cases, with some also being jailed. Banks have taken blank cheques from farmers, and when such a cheque bounces, a farmer has to face legal action because he is unable to pay the loan,” said Sudagar Singh, leader of Bhartiya Kissan Union (BKU) Ekta Ugrahan, who belongs to Ghudani village in Payal. “Yesterday at around 5pm, we had a meeting with cooperative and jails minister Sukhjinder Randhawa. Talks broke down after we stood by the demand that the government should not trouble farmers with less than ten acres of land who had a debt of Rs10 lakh, but they (government) stuck to their position, saying they would only waive off those farmer’s debt of Rs10 lakh who had land of five acres or less. After the talks ran into rough weather, we decided to stage a protest sit-in near the Zonal Office of Punjab National Bank (PNB) from 1pm to 4pm.” The farmer groups said 7,000 farmers from across the state participated in the protest march and sit-in. They added that farmer organizations that participated in the Thursday’s protest included BKU Ekta Ugrahan, BKU Krantikari, BKU Ekta Dakunda, Kissan Sangharsh Committee (Azad), Kissan Sangharsh Committee (Punjab), and two others farmer groups. “Authorities got directions from the court that we cannot assemble within 100 metres near the bank. As our demands have not been met, we rallied around 250m from the bank, but if the authorities don’t concede to our demands, we will go up to about 105 or 110m distance from the zonal branch of the bank,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of BKU Ekta Dakunda. He added: “Tomorrow, the hearing of the case is in the high court, and we will plead our case there as well.” Meanwhile, as farmer organizations blocked the ever-busy road, commuters had to face a lot of problems. The worst sufferers were those going towards Jagraon and Mullanpur Dakha, who did not have prior information about the blockade. “Even as the authorities had diverted traffic to Pakhowal Road and Hambran Road, it was quite a bad scenario for commuters because of the chaos. It took us an hour-and-a-half to reach Mullanpur, as after getting stuck in traffic on Ferozepur Road, we took the Pakhowal Road, but that too was choked for some time,” said Manjeet Singh, a city resident.

Sisodia alleged that PUBG has distorted the lifestyle of youth in urban and rural areas where a negative impact has clearly been noticed among the youth and their family. ""The youth is addicted to PUBG like opium . They are exposed to modern weapons and their violent use. Children are becoming more negative in their life and attitude. The game has been banned by seven states in the country and it should be banned in Madhya Pradesh too"", stated Sisodia in the house.

All the states are required to implement it looking at the negative effects of the game, he demanded.

The protest which entered its second phase on Wednesday was called by the Jharkhand police men’s association along with Jharkhand police association (JPA) and fourth grade police employees association. Police personnel, from constable to inspector ranks, assembled near the Ranchi SSP office and registered their protest. A similar protest was also held at various SP offices across the state where police officers, along with fourth grade employees, carried out their duties while on fast. Around 40 officers also sat on a protest in a makeshift tent in front of Khunti SP office in support of their demands. “We will continue our protests in a peaceful manner till our demands are met,” an inspector posted at Khunti police station said. JPA president Yogendra Singh, who has been camping in front of the state police headquarters, said, “Our brothers have whole heartedly supported the protest. Not only the district police but various companies of Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP) and India Reserve Battalion (IRB) have also supported the strike and are protesting in front of their commandant offices.” Singh, however, was quick to add that personnel on law and order duty also reported to duty but they went empty stomach as their support to the protest. Notably, police personnel had launched their protest on February 12 after talks between police association and government officials failed. The protest had started in the wake of state’s failure to keep their word even after repeated assurances. “We have been given assurances after assurances for the last two years but nothing concrete has come out from government’s side. We are not asking the government to approve the demands overnight, we are just requesting government to issue a notification in this regard even if the demands are fulfilled later,” Shambhu Yadav, vice-president of JPA, said. The seven point demand include filling of 1,150 vacant posts of sub-inspector and inspector ranks by giving promotion to havaldars and sipahis, to pay an extra month of salary on the lines of other states, revision of salary as per seventh pay commission recommendations, relaxation in age limit to the dependent or next of kin for compensatory jobs, to implement the old pension scheme instead of the new, to provide medical facilities to personnel on the lines of officers and to implement modified assured career progression as per the seventh pay commission which provides monetary benefits to personnel if their promotion is delayed.

The striking employees later in the afternoon took out a rally against the delay in lodging case against the minister and submitted memorandum to district collector demanding filing FIR against the minister. The incident of alleged slapping and abusing of the Discom engineer occurred at around 9pm on Monday near Keero Ki Jhopadia village on NH-148D but it came to light on Tuesday afternoon when the victim engineer submitted a complaint against state’s sports minister Ashok Chandana in Nainwa police station. “No case has been registered so far as the investigation into the allegations levelled by the Discom engineer against the state sports minister is underway,” the SHO said. Chandana was reportedly annoyed of executive engineer Jagdish Prasad Meena who on February 13 ordered lineman Mukesh Saini to join his duty after minister Ashok Chandana during a public hearing in the area on February 5 ordered for his suspension on receipt of complaint against him. Meanwhile, speaking to TOI , executive engineer J.P. Meena alleged the sports minister hatched a conspiracy to attack him. “Had the SE and other engineers had not intervened to defend me, the minister would have taken my life,” J P Meena said. Only the four engineers with him including the SE were eyewitness to the incident, he said. But the state minister for sports Ashok Chandana in a statement refuting allegations of assault on the engineer accepted that he did speak harsh words to him and slammed him for revoking suspension of the linesman without any inquiry. “The linesman was suspended following complaints by the villagers. But within ten days he was reinstated without conducting an enquiry.” He said he would not tolerate injustice to the people who had elected him as their representative with thumping majority. He alleged that during BJP rule the employees used to bribe local BJP leaders at the expense of the people and these corrupt officials are now feeling uneasy. ",21 Feb 2019,2019-02-21 00:00:00

Govt shelves breakwater project owing to protest from residents,Govt shelves breakwater project owing to protest from residents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-shelves-breakwater-project-owing-to-protest-from-residents/articleshow/68087046.cms,en,"Thiruvananthapuram: Ten years after the project was conceived, Veli breakwater scheme is less likely to be realized. The state government has cancelled the administrative sanction for the project, which was issued in 2015. Sanction was given for constructing two breakwater structures measuring 220m at a cost of Rs 23.50 crore. The project is being shelved owing to local protests. In 2018, harbour engineering department had awarded tenders and signed an agreement, however the contractor could never start work. “The residents raised concerns that northern shore of Veli would erode and that waste from Veli-Akkulam would directly reach sea and affect livelihood of coastal population. Around 5,000 residents had protested against the project,” an official of harbour engineering department said. He added that the project was key to prevent waterlogging in East Fort and Thampanoor and that it could have helped in elimination of weeds in the backwaters. District collector had held a meeting in 2017 to resolve the issue but a consensus could not be reached. The land was handed over to the contractor but with work being delayed for more than six months, the contractor communicated to the officials that he may be relieved of the works. In case of further delay, the department also faced the chance of dealing with arbitration for violation of contract. The department was forced to cancel the agreement and now government has cancelled the administrative sanction indicating that project has been dropped. The project was first approved in 2009. In May 2015, the then district collector and chief secretary had stressed on revamping the breakwater project at Veli so that the water flowing along the widened drains as part of Operation Anantha could be directed towards Veli without any hitch. The project that had been shelved for years was revived anticipating high tide during monsoon. Water from three canals Ulloor, Pattom and Amayizhanjan converge at Kannamoola and is discharged into Veli backwaters through Akkulam. Sandbars are formed naturally between the backwaters and the sea and in case of high tide, water is forced back and it surges in the reverse direction and usually sandbars are manually broken at Veli and Poonthura to control the tide. The project prepared by harbour engineering department had suggested formation of an artificial breakwater chain that would prevent deposit of sand and formation of sandbars. However the project was never considered for implementation even when Thampanoor, East Fort and Kannamoola flooded during heavy rain. In 2009, the tender was awarded and agreement was signed however lack of environmental clearance for the project led to the project being put off. The Veli breakwater project was conceived by the Harbour engineering department in 2009 at a cost of Rs 12 crore. In 2015 a revised estimate was prepared at Rs 25 crore.

BJP threatens to bring about a privilege motion in the House against Singh. ""Ministers take oath of office and assume the post. And yet, there is interference on how a minister should answer questions?"" wondered Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava as soon as the House started in the morning. ""It is now being said that state Congress office will prepare replies of ministers for questions asked in the House and only then will the ministers speak. This is an open breach of privilege of ministers,"" Bhargava added, accusing Singh of ""intruding into legislative affairs"". CM Kamal Nath took the battle to the BJP and said: ""No one needs to give me lessons on the Constitution."" ROW OVER MANDSAUR FIRING House sees verbal duel before Question Hr On Tuesday, Singh had publicly criticized Bachchan for saying that Mandsaur police firing — in which four farmers were killed — “was in self defence and as per norms”, and Singhar for saying that there was no financial irregularity in the plantation of 6 crore saplings by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan administration. “What was the need to defend BJP,” Singh asked, adding: “I walked 3,100km along the Narmada, I wonder how much Singhar has walked.” CM Nath had also tweeted that his government “will not spare those who fired at farmers or those involved in the afforestation scam”. On Wednesday, BJP said that Singh’s intervention” was a breach of privilege of ministers in the House. “It’s unprecedented that ministers will be rebuked outside the House for their replies here. Four ministers have been reprimanded,” Bhargava said. Chachora MLA Laxman Singh, who is Digvijaya’s brother, objected to his being named in the assembly by the Opposition. “You cannot name and accuse a person who is not present in the House,” he said. Legislative affairs minister Dr Govind Singh rejected BJP’s allegation that Pradesh Congress has been told to “ratify” replies of ministers. “There has been no such meeting or involvement of PCC,” he said. There was a verbal duel when Speaker N P Prajapati said the matter cannot be raised before Question Hour, but Bhargava argued that it was directly related to Question Hour. Former minister Narottam Mishra threatened to serve a breach of privilege notice. “The chief minister has tweeted on this subject. If the chief minister has had to tweet, then it is a Constitutional crisis. We will serve breach of privilege notice against Digvijaya Singh and these ministers,” Mishra said. The Speaker said that the House will not permit any discussion based on media reports. This triggered an open altercation between Congress and BJP MLAs. After Mishra mentioned Nath’s tweet, the CM looked at BJP legislators and said, “After a long time, you are in Opposition. I wish you a happy and long journey. No one needs to give me lessons on the Constitution. The seriousness of the House is our responsibility.” Mishra retorted, “We know the chief minister has knowledge of the Constitution. We are talking about his tweet.” Speaker Prajapati asked Mishra to let Question Hour run, to former Speaker Sitasharan Sharma said, “Questions will be asked, but the point is who will give the reply?” ",21 Feb 2019,2019-02-21 00:00:00

Protest over lack of NU blazers raises questions over scam,Protest over lack of NU blazers raises questions over scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/protest-over-lack-of-nu-blazers-raises-questions-over-scam/articleshow/68086792.cms,en,"Nagpur: In a fresh twist in the alleged Rs 5.7 lakh tracksuit and blazer scam unearthed in Nagpur University four months, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) launched a protest at NU main building on Wednesday. They claimed sportspersons were not getting uniforms even though the academic year was coming to an end. Former director of sports and physical education Kalpana Jadhav, who was accused of irregularity in the purchases, used the protest to claim that no students had protested earlier since they had got their uniforms in time when she was in charge. Jadhav said, “Why is the ABVP raising the issue now if they themselves claim that sports gear was not provided to teams for last couple of years? This means teams were getting the required blazers and tracksuits on time even though NU didn’t approve the department proposals on time.” Vice chancellor SP Kane had relieved Jadhav of the charge of director after allegations of malpractices in purchase of sport gear were levelled against her in December. Atmaram Pande, who replaced Jadhav, admitted that proposals to purchase new gear were pending for the last couple of years. “Proposals are gradually being cleared by the purchase committee, and soon all students will receive blazers,” he said. Jadhav said the fact that students are complaining now proves that no purchases were made. “Being from sports fraternity, some vendors had provided blazers and tracksuit due to my goodwill. The purchase committee takes a long time to approve our proposal, but the teams can’t wait. Competitions are lined up and teams have to leave on time. I had taken the stock on credit, but this was given a completely different angle,” she said. It had been alleged that Jadhav purchased sports gear worth Rs 5.70lakh first and then floated tenders, which were eventually awarded to the vendor who supplied the stock. The quality of tracksuits and blazers too was allegedly substandard. Jadhav said she had taken over charge at a very crucial phase, after the post had been lying vacant for almost a year. “There was a huge backlog, yet I ran the show smoothly for 20 months from March 2017 to December 2019. No students complained,” she said. VC Kane told reporters on Wednesday that he had appointed Jadhav to ensure all formalities were completed, and at least 100 sets were ready for teams in the department. “A full-time director would be appointed soon, and he will be asked to keep the stock ready,” he said.

Varsity expels Kashmiri student for ‘anti-national’ post after protests,Varsity expels Kashmiri student for ‘anti-national’ post after protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/varsity-expels-kashmiri-student-for-anti-national-post-after-protests/articleshow/68071275.cms,en,"GURUGRAM: A 20-year-old girl from Srinagar has been rusticated by a private university in the city after she was accused of sharing an “anti-national” post on social media in connection with the recent terrorist attack on a CRPF convoy in J&K’s Pulwama, in which 40 personnel were killed. The girl is a second-year Bachelors of Radio-Imaging Technology (BRIT) student at SGT University in Chandu Budhera. The order issued by the university's registrar on Tuesday said she was rusticated for causing “indiscipline at the campus”. Police said they had received a complaint but there were “insufficient grounds” to file an FIR against her. “We received a memorandum from students of the university on February 19 regarding an anti-national post circulated on social media,” the letter reads, quoting the name and enrolment number of the student. “The university shall not tolerate such type of indiscipline on campus. Hence, it has been decided that the student has been rusticated with immediate effect.” It all began with the girl uploading a story on Instagram on Monday night. She had purportedly shared a screen-grab of a Facebook post of another person — not a resident of Gurugram — who spoke of the use of pellet guns on demonstrators, and alleged differential treatment being meted out to people in Kashmir . There was an immediate backlash, in response to which she released a follow-up post, alleging atrocities on Kashmiris. This post triggered fury among her fellow students, who immediately decided to put together a response. At 9am on Tuesday, around 1,000 students marched on campus with a poster of the girl. “It was a peaceful demonstration,” said Mandeep Dagar, an MBA second- year student and one of the organisers of the rally. “The post was uploaded on Monday night on Instagram and WhatsApp. Her classmates saw the posts and took screen grabs,” he said. Protesting students claimed the screenshots made it to WhatsApp groups of various university departments. “They went viral across the campus. By morning, everyone decided to hold a rally to protest disrespect to soldiers,” said Sagar Gahlot, a BBA student. “Her posters were also burnt.” Students said the girl did not attend college in the morning. “When we finally assembled here, we could not see her,” said Praveen Kataria, who is pursuing LLB. “She had already got a whiff of impending protest against her, and the administration had made arrangements for her to leave.” The public relations officer (PRO) of SGT University confirmed to TOI that anti-Pakistan protests took place on the campus. “The agitation was peaceful. They demanded the student be rusticated. Following the complaints, the university formed a five-member committee which assessed the social media posts and decided to rusticate her. We informed her guardians who took the girl from her hostel and left,” the official said. Asked if the university will file an FIR against her, the official said, “No, we won’t. We have taken necessary action following the university regulations.” A police officer at Rajendra Park police station told TOI no FIR was registered against the student. “The evidence against her is not firm enough to merit a case of sedition,” he said. “The posts were not sent to anyone. She was sharing it on her profile. In the same complaint, students spoke of another Kashmiri student who had apparently intimidated other students. We’re investigating that too. We’ll check call records also during the investigation.” ",20 Feb 2019,2019-02-20 00:00:00

Before 1998, the whole tehsil was inside the 'inner line' and outsiders, other than locals, needed special permits to go to Dharchula and had no right to stay there permanently,"" said Dinesh Chala, vice-president of Dharchula Bacho Samiti.

A relative told TOI, “What we feared happened and she collapsed soon after the cremation. Though it is still 10 days to her due date, doctors said the stress and trauma could result in an early delivery.” Anti-Pakistan slogans reverberated on the cremation grounds of Basa Tikri village in Meerut on Tuesday as thousands thronged to pay their last respect to Ajay Kumar, 27, who was among the Army personnel killed in Pulwama on Monday. Emotions ran high as the martyr’s two-year-old son Arav lit the pyre. Basa Tikri, a village of 800 residents, has at least one member of every family serving in the armed forces. The village decided not to light stoves and cook for the day as mark of respect for Kumar. The jawan’s wife, Dimple, who is five months pregnant, said, “ Action should be strong enough to serve as deterrent against unabated killings of Indian soldiers.” Kamlesh Devi, Ajay’s mother, said, “So many of our sons have died. Pakistan is not so big that it cannot be destroyed by India.” Some hotel owners in Agra have put up pamphlets asking Kashmiris to keep away. They told TOI that they did not like the local population of Kashmir supporting militants.

The protesters alleged that the play has hurt national and religious sentiments through its narrative, during its first show on Monday. A written complaint seeking intervention of police was filed by the protesting groups at Bajaj Nagar police station. The play was to be staged at 4.30 pm on Tuesday, but the organisers announced its cancellation due to unforeseen circumstances. A group led by Suraj Soni of Jansamasya Niwaran Manch along with at least 25 protesters reached JKK and shouted slogans against the play and the organisers. A team of Bajaj Nagar police also reached the spot to take stock of the situation. “The play glorifies the stone-pelters of Kashmir and some of the dialogues in the play are objectionable and are not in the interest of the public and the Army. Some people had watched the first show of the play in which they found many things which can disturb communal harmony. Thus, we had given a written complaint at Bajaj Nagar police station seeking their intervention,” said Soni, while talking to the media gathered at JKK. The protesters have also asked the police to lodge a case of sedition under section 124-A and other appropriate sections of IPC. Director of the play, Abhishek Majumdar, said, “It is yet another attack on freedom of expression. There was nothing anti-national in the play and its narrative.” “We have taken the complaint lodged by the groups and have assigned the task of investigating it to an assistant sub-inspector,” said a senior officer of Bajaj Nagar police station. Members of Sarva Samaj Sangharsh Samiti, who too protested against the play, alleged that there were some parts in the play through which objectionable things were said on Lord Hanuman , the Hindu deity. “This is an anti-national play and has also affected the sentiments of the Hindu community. Thus, we have sought police intervention,” said Anil Chaturvedi, national coordinator of the samiti. ",20 Feb 2019,2019-02-20 00:00:00

On Monday, home minister Bala Bachahan said in assembly that police opened fire in Mandsaur “following standard procedure norms, in self-defence”. And forest minister Umang Singhar said there were no financial irregularities in the planting of saplings along Narmada’s banks, practically a clean chit to Chouhan’s government. Congress had attacked BJP relentlessly on both issues during campaign for the assembly polls. After the about-turn, BJP hit out at Congress for “misguiding the state for political gain”. CM Kamal Nath on Tuesday stepped in to try and save face. Sources in Congress told TOI Bachchan and Singhar will have to clarify their stand before party chief Rahul Gandhi. Nath made it clear his government has “resolved to ensure punishment to those involved in corruption and scams”. “We will neither spare those who shot farmers in Mandsaur, nor relieve those involved in the Narmada planting scam. We will also not spare those responsible for financial fraud during Simhastha… we have resolved to see this through,” he tweeted. Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh was scathing in his criticism of Singhar and Bachchan. “It is surprising the home and forest ministers gave a sort of clean chit to the previous BJP government. The home minister in his reply justified police firing on farmers, which is not acceptable to us. The forest minister replied there was no corruption in mass tree plant drive on Narmada’s banks. I walked 3,100km along the riverbank, how much has he walked? There was big corruption. What was the need for the forest minister to defend BJP?” asked Digvijaya. Reacting to Congress’s self-goals, state BJP accused ministers of lying, saying no matter what the ministers say now, their statements in the assembly would be considered official. “The ministers had spoken the truth in the House on both the Narmada drive and Mandsaur firing. Now, they are openly lying,” said BJP’s Gopal Bhargava. ",20 Feb 2019,2019-02-20 00:00:00

While only about 15,000 people, who had deposited up to Rs 10,000 in different Ponzi firms, have received their refunds, over 8 lakh investors are still waiting to get it, sources said.

The situation was, however, pacified after the police intervened into the matter. The police, after preliminary investigations, convinced the villagers that the flag was a religious flag associated with Islam and it’s followers. Earlier, the villagers had started creating ruckus mistaking the green flag as the national flag of Pakistan and demanded the police to book the house owner. According to the police, the incident took place after someone spread rumour that one Mohd Anees had hoisted the Pakistani flag atop his house in Kaindha village of Sachendi area on Monday. The mischief-mongers thereafter alerted the police control room about the same which in turn apprised the local police station. Sensing the gravity of the situation, the police rushed to the spot and launched an investigation in this regard. The police questioned the house owner Anees and his family members. “They, however, apprised us that the flag atop their house was an Islamic flag which they had unfurled on the occasion of Barawafat recently.

On Monday, home minister Bala Bachahan said in the assembly that police opened fire in Mandsaur ""following standard procedure norms, in self-defence. And forest minister Umang Singhar said there were no financial irregularities in the plantation drive conducted along the Narmada banks. Congress had attacked BJP relentlessly on both these issues during campaign for assembly polls. After the about-turn on Monday, BJP demanded a public apology. Bachchan gave the Mandsaur statement in reply to queries raised by Congress MLA Harsh Vijay Gahlot. ""On June 6, 2017, police firing at Bahi Chaupati on Mhow-Neemuch Road in the absence of executive magistrate, was done by complying to SOP for self-defence. It was to protect government and private property. The order was given by SDM Malhargarh, Sharavan Bhandari in Pipliya Mandi,"" read his statement. On government action on the Justice Jain report, Bachchan said, ""The report is being reviewed and appropriate legal action will be taken after examining the findings."" The Jain report had mentioned ""communication gap"" between farmers and officials. ""The administration wasn't aware of their demands and did not make any effort to find out. But, the district administration wasn't in a position to address demands that farmers should get better prices or a loan waiver. Thus, police firing on June 6 was necessary and legal,"" the report said. Even after coming to power in the state, Congress minister Jitu Patwari, who had accompanied AICC chief Rahul Gandhi during his Mandsaur visit in June 2018, said, ""Those who fired at the farmers in Mandsaur shouldn't be spared."" Patwari had also tweeted on December 25, 2018, that the Congress government will ""reopen the Mandsaur investigation"". After the U-turn, BJP hit out at Congress. ""It was Congress's planned propaganda to attack BJP over the farmer issue. They misguided farmers and the entire country during assembly elections,"" said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal. It was a repeat of this with the Narmada plantation. Congress had all along alleged that there were irregularities in the plantation drive, but minister Singhar said in the House on Monday: ""The state government has not found any irregularity or misappropriation of funds during the plantation drive on the banks of holy river Narmada. The department has issued instructions to examine the condition of saplings planted on July 2, 2017. There is no question of investigating the matter."" In July 2017, when the then Shivraj regime said it had planted 6 crore saplings along the Narmada, Congress smelt a ""scam"". ""It's a big scam in the name of Narmada. It's not only the question of planting 6 crore saplings, but also how much expenditure was incurred on it?"" Congress president Kamal Nath had asked in May 2018. Now, HIS minister has given it the clean chit. BJP launched a scathing attack on Congress for ""misguiding people"". ""Now, the forest minister admitted that there was no financial irregularity or misappropriation. Congress must apologize in public for its fake propaganda against BJP,"" said Agrawal.

At DU, students usually protest at the conference centre, which houses the office of the dean (students’ welfare) and admission department. The other area is Arts Faculty. In the past, students have demonstrated in the library demanding better facilities. Students’ groups have opposed the circular stating that their right to protest is being curtailed. DUSU president Shakti Singh said such notices are curtailment of their freedom of speech and expression. “The university is a democratic space and everyone has a right to raise their voice. Students have the right to choose the place of protest so that their voices reach the university administration. We have submitted a memorandum to the university against it,” he added. Another group, Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS) representing the students of School of Open Learning, said that such advisories are undemocratic in nature. “When the university doesn’t listen to voices of individual students, we assemble in groups and protest where the administration stays. How can they tell us not to do so? This is an autocratic rule and we will protest against it,” said Harish Gautam of KYS. ",17 Feb 2019,2019-02-17 00:00:00

Parents of students studying outside of Jammu and Kashmir are the most worried lot though the Union home ministry has issued instructions to all states to ensure safety of the Kashmiris. The J&K governor's administration has established helpline desks in Srinagar and other district headquarters for parents to know about their wards studying outside the state. Rouf Wani of Srinagar said: ""My son is studying in Jamia Millia Delhi and my entire family is worried since we heard of attacks on several students by mobs in other states."" Neelofar Ara, a single parent, told TOI that she was worried about the well being of her only son, who was studying in Dehradun, Uttarakhand. As per reports, some Kashmiri youths studying in Dehradun have alleged that they are being harassed and asked by their landlords to vacate their accommodations fearing attacks on their properties. Sunday's shutdown was observed on a call given by Kashmir Traders' Federation and the bandh was complete with all shops and business establishments remaining shut, besides public and private vehicles staying off the roads. Frenzied right-wing groups had on Friday attacked Kashmiris in Jammu as well. The widespread violence had reduced nearly 30 vehicles belonging to a particular community to ashes. So far, more than 50 vehicles have been damaged in Jammu in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack. Meanwhile, mobile internet services remained suspended in most parts of Kashmir. Besides, network speed was throttled in Baramulla, Kupwara and Bandipora districts of the state as a precautionary measure, officials said. Former J&K CM and National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah on Sunday expressed concern over the attacks on Kashmiris outside the state. In a series of tweets, Omar said, ""By attacking them, terrorizing them & forcing them to find the shelter they are being told there is no place for them outside the valley & no future in the mainland."" In another tweet, he said, ""Young Kashmiri students studying outside J&K should have been feted as examples of people who have stayed away from the politics & conflict in Kashmir, choosing instead to make a future for themselves."" In yet another tweet, Omar said, ""Our enemies & those who back terrorism in J&K have been trying to drive this wedge so please let's not do their job for them.

The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the protesters but were met with stone-pelting. An eye-witness said that since 7am, groups of commuters were seen raising slogans condemning the terror attack. ""By 8am, it snowballed into a protest and thousands gathered on the tracks. The railway police tried to pacify the mob but in vain. By 12 pm, the police resorted to a mild lathicharge. However, the mob retaliated and pelted stones at the cops,"" said the eye-witness. At least four policemen sustained minor injuries. The situation was completely out of control as the protesters outnumbered the Railway Police Force and police personnel, said a source. The tracks were cleared only after the lathicharge. “The suburban railway tracks at Nalasopara, Virar and Bhayander were cleared and all train services were restored by 1pm,” said WR public relations officer Gajanan Mahatpurkar. Protests were witnessed at Virar and Bhayander railway stations too, but were brought under control soon. There was an attempt by another group of 50 people to stage a rail roko at Mankhurd station on Harbour line in the afternoon, but it was averted by RPF and Central Railway officials. As many as 54 suburban trains were cancelled during the morning peak hour and over 14 long-distance trains were delayed or short-terminated due to the protests. During the hours that train traffic was affected, WR managed to operate some trains between Churchgate and Vasai Road stations, a source said. WR chief spokesperson Ravinder Bhakar said that jumping on the tracs was completely unwarranted and appealed to citizens to not stop trains as it affects the transport “lifeline” of Mumbai. “This is not the way to protest by putting scores of commuters to inconvenience. Our officials and RPF personnel tried several ways to request the protesters to get off the tracks. A lot of trains arriving in Mumbai from other districts and states were held up and suburban services badly hit,” he stated. Anger ",17 Feb 2019,2019-02-17 00:00:00

I just wanted to raise one small point, that Jammu and Kashmir have been an integral part of the Indian state since they acceded to Indian in 1949. In your tweet you used the phrase ‘India-administered Kashmir’, which is deeply offensive to many in India, and this country, as it suggests that India is a colonisation nation, whereas the state chose to join India in 1947 due to constitutional commitment to secularism and plurality.” Virendra Sharma further said: “I hope that you will withdraw this phrase and demure from using it again in the future due to the connotations this seemingly innocuous phrase contains,” Virendra Sharma said.

Didn't know it would be the last conversation with him,” said Umesh Kumar, brother of Pradeep Kumar (37) who was posted in Srinagar and was part of 21st Battalion of CRPF. Just two days ago, Pradeep had left after completing vacation. Holding tears, his father, Jagdish Kumar said: “I am proud of my son who gave sacrifice for the country. But, his martyrdom should not go in vain. We demand action from our government strong enough to instill fear in the hearts of terrorists.” ",16 Feb 2019,2019-02-16 00:00:00

Maneswar Basumatary, a CRPF head constable from Baksa district, was among the victims of the attack perpetrated by Pak-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed. State BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass visited Basumatary’s family on Friday. Congress also organised a prayer meeting at its state headquarters at Rajiv Bhavan for Basumatary. The slain jawan’s mortal remains are scheduled to reach home on Saturday. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said, “Basumatary’s sacrifice in the line of duty will be remembered by the whole nation. His martyrdom will keep inspiring all those engaged in protecting the country and make the fight against terrorism more intensified.” The national flag of Pakistan was torched in several parts of the state by activists of All BTC Minority Students’ Union, All Assam Goriya Moriya Deshi Jatiya Parishad and other influential local organizations. Special prayers were conducted at one of the state’s oldest mosques, Burah (Jame) Masjid, for the departed souls. Nizamul Haque, general secretary of the Masjid, said, “Such cowardly acts by militants can never discourage the moral of our jawans. India must take down militancy with iron hands and we ask everyone in society to maintain peace and stand together.” State Jamiyat Ulama president Maulana Fazlul Karim Kasami said, “Militancy has no religion. The perpetrators should be brought to justice at any cost.” He also demanded the resignation of Union home minister Rajnath Singh, blaming him of failing to maintain law and order in the country. The Tripura government announced it will give compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the families of each victim. Saying his government will provide the ex-gratia to all the families even the final casualty count increases, chief minister Biplab Deb said, “I condemn the cowardly act of anti-Indian forces and I demand a strong action against the terrorists and their patronisers.” Candlelight marches were organized in Fancy Baazaar and Ganeshguri in Guwahati, Silchar , Bongaigaon, Tezpur, Hailakandi, Karimganj and Kokrajhar.

Talking to media at the rally in Silchar, Congress leaders said the party demands capital punishment for the perpetrators and snatching of diplomatic ties with Pakistan. All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya said, “The Assam government has already admitted the presence of several Islamic fundamentalist groups in the state and many such elements have already been nabbed by security forces. Therefore, the state’s security is also at stake and the government must act on it urgently.” Taking no chances, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal immediately reviewed the law and order situation on Friday and directed state police chief Kuladhar Saikia to take all necessary steps to ensure that the law and order situation in the state is not disturbed.

Speaking to TOI, registrar of CUTN S Bhuvaneswari said the two faculty members recruited on a contract basis were removed after they were found guilty of misbehaviour and misconduct.

The two assistant professors who were employed on a contract basis were also resident wardens of ladies hostel. They were earlier warned by the administration for being student friendly, said the protesting students. “Their only mistake was to go soft on girls hostel students by letting them in after 9.30pm,” they said. Another student said the administration terminated both of them over an email without any prior notice claiming that they failed to ensure disciplinary rules in the ladies hostel. Many students have cleared UGC-NET with the coaching provided by them, said the student. Tamil Nadu state committee of students federation of India expressed its dissent at the CUTN administration decision on terminating two assistant professors for raising their voice for the larger student community. A complaint regarding the lack of basic amenities in the hostels was raised by the two faculties to the chief warden earlier.

BJP councillors on Friday protested against their own Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) board at the civic body’s office. Former chairman of gaushala committee, Bhagwant Singh Deval, who was removed two years back after almost 200 cows were found dead at Hingonia gaushala, was among the BJP councillors along with councillor Ashok Garg who protested in JMC. Garg said, “This is a pure neglect of the JMC authorities along with Akshaya Patra Foundation . If the foundation cannot handle the gaushala, then it should leave the work but they are worried about the donation that they receive in the name of cow service. This is cruelty towards the cows.” Chief executive officer of JMC, V P Singh, immediately suspended two officials of JMC animal husbandry department and a team was sent to Hingonia gaushala for rehabilitation. Manager of Hingonia gaushala, Radhey Priya Das, however refuted the claims of cows dying because of fodder scarcity. “Teams of JMC, CMO and animal husbandry department visited the gaushala for inspection and left satisfied with our work. Everyday around 70 cows die in the gaushala as many cows are brought here in old and poor condition. This is true that JMC haven’t cleared our bills for past five months of Rs 12 crore but we have been providing fodder to the cows anyhow. This is a planned story by the former chairman of Hingonia gaushala Bhagwant Singh Deval, who is not happy that we are managing the place after he was removed. ” Sri Krishna Balram Seva Trust (SKBT) entered into an agreement with the JMC for daily management of cattle rehabilitation after mass death was witnessed. The trust has also highlighted problem of inadequate staff in maintaining the shelter with large population of cows.

The report, which was not made public by the Punjab government for the last 32 years, says then SP (operations) did not seek mandatory permission from the district magistrate, sitting hardly at a distance of 1 kilometer, before resorting to firing at the mob. The commission had completed the probe into the February 4, 1986, police firing incident at Sherpur bridge in Nakodar ( Jalandhar ) on October 31, 1986, and submitted the report to then Shiromani Akali Dal government headed by chief minister Surjit Singh Barnala. Ravinder Singh, Jhalman Singh, Baldhir Singh and Harminder Singh had died in the police firing and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) had put up their pictures at the Sikh museum in Amritsar a few years ago. The commission in its report, a copy of which is with TOI, found that then SP (operations) A K Sharma, who was heading the police force, did not seek mandatory permission from district magistrate Darbara Singh Guru before resorting to firing at the mob. “The order that effective firing should be on the lower part of the body was totally ignored and it appears that the four persons who died were aimed (hit) at the vital parts of their bodies so as to kill them,” concludes the panel report. After the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) raised the issue in the Punjab assembly’s ongoing budget session to make the report public, speaker Rana K P Singh told the House on Wednesday that the panel report was presented in the state assembly on December 16, 1986, and also on March 5, 2001, but action taken report on the panel’s report was never presented in the assembly. The commission had recorded, “All these circumstances show that the situation was not properly handled by A K Sharma and he did not even get the help of SSP Jalandhar (Mohammad Izhar Alam, who later retired as state police DGP) and district magistrate Jalandhar (Darbara Singh Guru), who were available.” Guru later remained principal secretary to chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and after retirement, unsuccessfully contested assembly election on SAD ticket in 2012 from Bhadaur constituency. “The mob was not armed with such weapons with which they could cause any danger to the security forces. They were still at a distance of 15 to 20 yards from the security forces and there was no danger to the lives of the security men, nor to any public man,” the panel added. “The mob simply proceeded to go to the gurdwara for ‘darshan’ of the holy burnt ‘birs’ and firing was ordered. For the simple injuries on persons of some policemen, killing of four persons and injuring eight persons was not justified.” A US-based couple, Baldev Singh and his wife Balbir kaur, had written to Punjab CM Amarinder Singh last year, asking him to reveal the contents of a judicial commission’s report on the Behbal Kalan firing-like killing of four Sikh youths in Nakodar, Jalandhar district, on February 4, 1986. The demand by the couple, who are parents of victim Ravinder Singh, had come close on the heels of Amarinder announcing that the probe report on Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan firing would soon be tabled in the state assembly.

The villagers after somehow managing to trap the big cat protested against the forest department for not being able to stop the big cat movements in the region. Angry villagers blocked a road putting the leopard’s cub in the middle of the road. The situation was pacified only after police intervention. After the incident, the forest officials also gave an assurance that soon all the leopards will be caught from the nearby villages. District Forest Officer, Kanhiya Patel, said, “The leopard cub caught by the farmers was taken into the custody of the forest officials. The cub is healthy but is not in-taking food due to the stress. Hopefully, that will start soon. We send him to the Kanpur zoo. A large number of leopards have strayed out of the forest and made the adjacent sugarcane fields their home. This is due to the rising population of tigers in the nearby Amangarh Tiger Reserve and Corbett National Park situated near Thakurdwara tehsil.” Villagers allege that the man-animal conflicts in the region have multiplied and the farmers in the region fear going to fields due to the many leopard attack incidents in the recent past. The latest victim, identified as Hori Singh, a resident of Balapur village, was attacked by a leopard when he was sleeping in his animal shed adjacent to his house. Meanwhile, wildlife experts say that man-animal conflict increases during the winter season.

Although there are many women scholars and rationalists, why is it that popular actresses are allotted cabinet berths?” he asked. Questioning the discrepancy in Reservation at the Centre and in Karnataka, Hanumanthappa said, “At the Centre, Reservation for Dalits is at 7.5%, whereas it is a mere 3% in Karnataka. It is imperative that 7.5% Reservation be extended to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Karnataka too. While 10% Reservation has been extended to upper castes from economically weaker sections, those still struggling to get into the mainstream are accorded just 8%.” Hanumanthappa also demanded stringent action against those targeting Dalits and members of religious minorities under the garb of cow protection. “The central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to create jobs.

On Monday, the Women’s Development Cell of the college had organised a public discussion on ‘Virgin Tree: Legacy or Objectification?’ after many students deemed the celebrations offensive. The hostel union then agreed to make changes to the puja to make it more inclusive and to “end the objectification”. This year, the posters of an actress and actor as Damdami Mai and Love Guru were replaced by a poster of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma as a symbol of a successful relationship. The union also hung posters saying “love has no gender” to include LGBTQI representation, and did away with its usual ‘aarti’.

Trivandrum international airport is among the six airports, proposed to be given on lease by the central government on private-public partnership model (PPP) model. The protest conducted at the domestic terminal of the airport was inaugurated by LDF state convener A Vijayaraghavan. He alleged that the privatisation bid is an election fund-raising programme of the BJP. Earlier, the LDF had observed a ‘Black Day’ in December, when the central government went forward with its decision to include Trivandrum airport in the bid and asked the state government to participate in the bidding process. The state government formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV), the Trivandrum International Airport Limited, to participate in the bidding process. Allegations have been raised that the LDF launched the indefinite strike after it realized that the possibilities were dim for the state government to win the bid. The protest conducted by the airport authority employees at the airport has crossed 73 days, with taxi drivers’ union also extending its support. The AAI employees said that the government can still prevent the privatisation bid by refusing to agree with the PPP model. The Trivandrum Airport Users Group, a collective of city residents who frequently travel through Trivandrum airport, has planned to conduct a counter-protest against the indefinite protest launched against privatisation bid. They plan to hold the protest in the weekend. “Our aim is to mobilize more airport users who would speak about the need for privatisation of the airport,” said Robin K Rajan, a member of the collective.

Anganwadi workers protest over pending demands,Anganwadi workers protest over pending demands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/anganwadi-workers-protest-over-pending-demands/articleshow/67981922.cms,en,"AURANGABAD: A large number of anganwadi workers from across the district staged an agitation on Wednesday to highlight various pending demands including revision of monthly honorarium and reforms in transfer policy. Standing united under the banner of Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), over 2,000 people staged the protest outside Aurangabad zilla parishad. The protesters later tried to barge into the cabin of zilla parishad CEO Pavneet Kaur, but were detained by the police. Leftist leader Ram Baheti accused the state government for not increasing the monthly honorarium of anganwadi workers for the past four months despite announcement from the Centre. “Anganwadi sevikas are slated to get a hike of Rs1,500 per month taking their salary to Rs9,000 per month, while monthly honorarium of anganwadi assistants is expected to increase from Rs3,500 per month to Rs4,500 per month, as announced by the Centre. The state government, however, has failed to endorse the decision taken by the Central government,” Baheti said, adding that affected staffers were running out of patience. Pressing for reforms in the transfer policy, Baheti said the existing rules do not allow posting of Anganwadi workers near their home. “The monthly honorarium of staffers is relatively low and they cannot afford expenses towards travelling far from their homes. There is a need to reform the existing anti-employee norms,” he said. Among other demands, protesters also raised the pitch for release of retirement benefits. “The government in the past had announced one-time retirement benefit of Rs1 lakh and Rs75,000 to anganwadi sevikas and assistants, respectively. However, no such aid has been released,” an anganwadi sevika said. The protest also saw overwhelming response to the demand for releasing pending Travelling Allowance (TA). “The TA of staffers is kept on hold for over three years. These staffers need to attend at least two meetings outstation and therefore needs timely release of TA,” another protester said. Aurangabad district has around 3,000 anganwadis that employs over 6,000 staffers. ",14 Feb 2019,2019-02-14 00:00:00

At 12.30 pm, Negi skipped the assembly session and headed straight to the chief engineer’s office in Yamuna Colony. Soon, heated words were exchanged between Negi and chief engineer Rakesh Purohit over pending clearance of dues. The legislator’s sit-in protest went on for over half-an-hour, and he decided to call of his stir after the officials assured him to clear funds immediately. Talking to TOI, Negi claimed that the project has been deliberately kept in limbo despite getting a go-ahead from chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat . “I ended my protest after I was given assurance that the proposal will be cleared on priority basis. The PWD chief engineer has been instructed to file a compliance report,” said Negi. The proposal was conceptualized last year and the cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 70 lakh. The PWD officials, on the other hand, claimed that the clearance was given only for the construction of a concrete bridge, whereas Negi had been demanding for a steel bridge. “We had cleared the proposal to construct a concrete bridge, but another proposal was forwarded to us for construction of a steel bridge. While running a cost comparison on both the projects, it emerged that the steel bridge costs Rs 1.40 crore. Because of the cost escalation, the second proposal was not given clearance. We will apprise the CM and present the facts before him,” said a senior PWD official who did not wish to be named. ",14 Feb 2019,2019-02-14 00:00:00

On Tuesday, some AMU students allegedly had an altercation with a TV channel crew which had come to film the visit that ultimately did not take place, they said. The BYJM members held a separate demonstration against the visit, demanding that the MP should be banned from the campus. The students were booked under sedition charges after a complaint was filed by Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha or BJYM activist Mukesh Lodhi, alleging that he was assaulted amid chants of pro-Pakistan slogans by some students, police said.

They demanded that he be not allowed to enter the campus. Owaisi, however, did not turn up. An AMU spokesman said a TV channel team, which had come to cover the anticipated event, had an altercation with some students while they were filming inside the campus.

Narayanasamy said he had written to Bedi urging her to fulfil the 39-charter demand of the government.

Aggrieved industrialists claimed the 25% hike in the power tariff has become unaffordable for their units as production cost has spiked. Industries staged the demonstration in the morning under the aegis of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA). Industrial associations like Nashik Industries & Manufacturers' Association (NIMA), Ambad Industries & Manufacturers' Association (AIMA), Laghu Uydog Bharti and other associations joined the protest.

Around a month back, industrial associations had warned of agitation if the hike in power tariff is not rolled back. But neither MSEDCL nor the state government took a call on the issue. Finally, industries staged their agitation on Tuesday. ""Industry has been badly affected by the steep hike in power tariff. We urged the government to roll back the hike, but nothing has happened so far,"" said MACCIA state president Santosh Mandlecha. Mandlecha said that power tariff hike that came into effect from September 2018 should be rolled back.

Varun Talwar , president of Ambad Industries & Manufacturers' Association, said power is used as raw material in many sectors of industries and 25% hike in power tariff would severely affect growth of industries. Forging, automobile and steel casting industries, for instance, are increasingly becoming unviable because of the high price of electricity, protesters said. The business of industries from these sectors has been affected and the government ought not to delay action, protesters said. ",13 Feb 2019,2019-02-13 00:00:00

Over 30,000 staff are working on contract basis in the health and family welfare and medical departments. They include lab technicians, pharmacists, data-entry operators, technical staffers, doctors and nurses. “While the CM assured us he would look into our demands, he also advised us to resolve smaller issues and demands, such as formation of an internal grievance committee, by coordinating with health department officials directly. However, when we tried, officials did not respond positively. We then decided to carry out a march to the CM’s residence.

Reena, however, said she will continue to protest until all heir demands are met. “I have been a staff nurse for about nine years and I still earn only half of what permanent employees of the health department get.

AUSU is dominated by SP’s student wing. Targeting the government, Akhilesh claimed that he also had to attend a lunch hosted by Akhara Parishad chief at Kumbh Mela ground, which the ruling BJP was not comfortable with. Chief minister Yogi Adtiyanath, however, said the decision to stop SP president from boarding the flight was taken on the recommendation of Allahabad district authorities which feared a law and order crisis on his arrival. It all began around 11am when Yadav reached Amausi airport to board a special flight to Allahabad but was stopped by district officials following which he demanded a written order to this effect. In the melee, Akhilesh’s security personnel allegedly heckled a district official when he tried to stop him physically. As Akhilesh waited for the written order from officials, he tweeted: “I was prevented from boarding the airplane without any written orders. Currently detained at Lucknow airport.” He also tweeted photographs, apparently clicked from inside the aircraft he was to board, showing one administration official and a police officer at its gate blocking the entry of Akhilesh who stood on tarmac. Principal secretary (home) Arvind Kumar said that the Allahabad University administration had denied permission to allow any political leader’s presence at AUSU event and had communicated the same to district officials in Allahabad who in turn intimated CM’s office and DM Lucknow. “It was on the recommendation of Prayagraj district administration, that authorities in Lucknow stopped Akhilesh Yadav,” said inspector general law and order Praveen Kumar. SP chief posted a couple of tweets and held a press conference stating that BJP was scared of his visit to Allahabad and his growing popularity among students. “I wasn’t going to meet the students only. I was to attend a lunch hosted by Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri as well, but I was not allowed,” he said. “Ye Uttar Pradesh ke mukhya mantri kaise sadhu sant yogi hain … jo doosre sadhu sant yogiyon se nahi milne dena chahte (What kind of seer, yogi is this UP CM who doesn’t allow people to meet other saints),” Akhilesh said addressing media at party headquarters. He also alleged that additional intelligence sleuths were deployed outside his residence since 6.30am but they did not inform him about the restrictions when he left for airport. Cautioning Yogi to face similar treatment, he said: “Yaad rakhein, agar yeh vyahvar ye kar rahe hain to apne saath bhi taiyar rahein … ki aisa hi vyavhar inke saath hoga (They should be prepared, similar treatment will be meted out to them).” About CM’s claims that the government had informed him in advance about the decision that he will not be allowed to attend the AUSU event, Akhilesh said CM Yogi should not lie because he is a a seer. “Sadhu, Sanyasi hokar jhooth nahi bolna chahiye,” he said. Asked if the government move was connected in anyway to a similar restriction imposed in 2015 on then Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath’s visit to Allahabad University for a student union event by then SP government, Akhilesh said the two cannot be compared as Yogi has a host of criminal cases against him while he has none. In Lucknow, SP MLAs and MLCs staged a sit-in at Raj Bhawan seeking governor Ram Naik’s intervention against police action on SP workers. The protest was called off after Raj Bhawan staff informed that the governor was out of station. A 15-member joint delegation of SP-BSP will hand over a memorandum to governor Naik on Wednesday. The development led to statewide protests by SP workers inviting police action in which sitting MP Dharmendra Yadav and several others were injured during cane charge in Allahabad. In Lucknow, party workers staged protest outside the airport while both houses were adjourned following unruly scenes and walkout by SP lawmakers. ",12 Feb 2019,2019-02-12 00:00:00

On Tuesday morning, Guha tweeted, “I salute the Principal and Vice Principal who have resigned because their college’s trustees disinvited @jigneshmevani80. They represent the best traditions of Gujarat. Patel, Gandhi, and Hansa Mehta would have been proud of them.” While Chidambaram tweeted, “Salute the brave acts of resignation of HK Arts College principal Mr Hemantkumar Shah and vice principal Mr Mohanbhai Parmar to uphold freedom of speech.” The trustees who refused permissions included its president and 2018 Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Padma Shri B V Doshi, Padma Shri Kumarpal Desai, Gyanpith Award winner Raghuvir Chaudhry, Amrish Shah and Rajesh Jaikrishna. Guha reportedly identifies with HK College incident as he too was a victim of a similar bullying by right wingers. In November last year, Guha declined to join Ahmedabad University (AU) as Shrenik Lalbhai Chair Professor of Humanities and director of the Gandhi Winter School after ABVP activists influenced the board members of AU members to refuse the position to Guha. Back then, Guha had tweeted that he will not be joining AU “due to circumstances beyond his (Guha’s) control”. Later ABVP secretary Pravin Desai in a statement admitted to oppose Guha’s appointment in an educational institution in Gujarat citing `anti-national content from his book `Makers of Modern India'. Interestingly, Doshi's silence has baffled many as he too has suffered right wing vandalism. Back in 1990s, an underground art gallery called Hussain-Doshi Gufa — designed by Doshi as a permanent exhibition of late artist M F Husain’s paintings — was vandalized by a right wing organization. ""Doshi protested by renaming the art gallery as ‘Amdavad ni Gufa’ and the exhibition was closed to public. The gallery was attacked again in 2002 after it reopened,"" recalls an educationist. Mevani, who has criticized trustees succumbing to right-wing pressure, told TOI, “Beginning Wednesday, in each of the public address at Rajkot, Thiruvananthapuram , and in Guwahati, I will speak openly about our teacher’s stand and the regressive behaviour of the BJP-led governments in the country and how they are suffocating democratic institutions. I even plan to bring out a booklet in this connection which will be distributed among the people.” ",13 Feb 2019,2019-02-13 00:00:00

The Baga hill, parts of which are in Calangute and Arpora on the southern, western and eastern sides, and in Anjuna on the northern side, has been in the news in recent weeks after locals found a road being allegedly illegally constructed on top of the hill on comunidade land Locals have also objected to an area of 50,000sqm being shown as settlement zone in the Outline Development Plan (ODP) for Arpora-Nagoa by the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA). However, NGPDA chairman and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo had recently clarified that the 50,000sqm land belongs to the Calangute comunidade, which had requested the NGPDA to convert the land into settlement zone. The communidade wants to develop small residential plots on the land for its ‘gaunkars’, he said. He added that a Baga resident had also laid claim to the land as a tenant and had approached the court, which had dismissed her claim, after which the communidade had approached the NGPDA. The plot is on the plateau and does not have an access road. Lobo said other land owners in the area had also sought conversion to settlement zone, but the NGPDA had rejected their applications as hill slopes are eco-sensitive zones. Lobo also said the Arpora-Nagoa panchayat had written to the NGPDA to show a road to the hilltop on the ODP, adding that the alleged illegal road was not being constructed by the panchayat or the NGPDA. There is also a proposal to build a ‘Jesus retreat park’ on the land overlooking the sea with a giant statue of Jesus Christ. There is already a Jesuit retreat house at Baga. With locals, activists, panchayat members and the Calangute MLA making claims and counter claims, there are others who want the area to be left untouchable. “It’s one of the most beautiful places in Goa and should not be destroyed by development. You get a strong sense of spiritual peace when you go and sit there,” a Calangute resident said. ",12 Feb 2019,2019-02-12 00:00:00

Cabinet minister Vishvendra Singh camping at Sawai Madhopur for coordination with protesting leaders, however, said that the ball was now in the court of Gujjars, who have been invited for talks. Bainsla maintained that neither he nor anyone else from the rail tracks will go for talks. Gujjars occupying rail tracks with Bainsla, on the other hand, are losing interest. The Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti has urged them to keep faith in Bainsla. Members of Gujjar community on the railway tracks woke up in anticipation that their fellow members in rest of the state should also join the stir and participate in the road jam. By the afternoon their news network from various parts of Rajasthan fetched them details on road jams at Sikandara in Dausa, Kushali Darra in Sawai Madhopur and other parts of the state. The internet services were suspended at Malrana Dungar area and the villages surrounding the railway tracks on Monday evening. Bainsla appeared little exhausted and angry with the dilly dally approach of the state government. “We had given ultimatum to the state government 20 days ago and when we were unheard we came on the tracks. A day after cabinet minister Vishvendra Singh and bureaucrat Neeraj K Pawan came and we have told them loud and clear that we will not budge from the tracks. We are into the fourth day and there is no message from the state government,” said Bainsla while talking to TOI. “I can hold my youth and men for some time but if they lose patience government is to be blamed,” he said. Bainsala through video calling appealed Gujjars in various parts of the state to jam the state and national highways across the state. He urged that neither he nor the Gujjars will move from the tracks until government hands them over the notification confirming 5 percent reservation under Most Backward Classes(MBC) including Gujjars. Tourism minister Vishvendra Singh, who is camping at Sawai Madhopur, said, “We went to the tracks as demanded by the Gujjar community and requested them to prepare their team to sit with us and discuss it out. I have been waiting for the past 2 days since I invited them. Government is ready to initiate talks with Bainsla saab who is universally accepted leaders of the community.” “Things would be resolved only through talks. We are trying our best,” said Neeraj K Pawan, the IAS officer who is part of two-member delegation that had parleys with the Gujjars on Saturday at the railway tracks. The protesters were clueless on what is going to be next? “We have seen enough in our fight for quota and it is high time that we should stay united and continue to be on the tracks. Be patient the government will have to give what we deserve,” Bainsla said while addressing the community members on the tracks. The train services remained affected on the Delhi-Mumbai rail route. At least 22 trains remained diverted while almost 12 trains were cancelled so far on the route.

A scuffle broke out between security personnel and protesters, the latter accusing police of high-handedness. Over 100 protesters were detained but released later in the day. “By staying firm on their stand on the CAB, despite people’s movements against it, BJP-led government has shown how undemocratic it is… Three state governments in northeast have opposed the bill. But the Centre is not ready to listen to them,” said CPM state secretariat member Suprakash Talukdar. In Assam, students of Dibrugarh University, among the most vocal opponents of CAB used blood drawn from their hands as ink to write slogans against the contentious bill. With a ‘Rokto Hapath (Pledge by Blood)’, a dozen students on campus drew blood from their hands with syringes and blades, with which they wrote anti-bill messages on placards and banners. “We’re ready to give our blood and our life to compel the government to withdraw the controversial bill,” Devid Hazarika, a student leader said. Meanwhile, netas from the northeast, including Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma and an AGP delegation led by party chief Atul Bora, were in Delhi in a final attempt to rally forces against CAB, likely to be placed before Rajya Sabha on February 13 as a supplementary bill.

Protest against job fair ‘frauds’,Protest against job fair ‘frauds’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/protest-against-job-fair-frauds/articleshow/67949606.cms,en,"Bathinda: Dubbing the job fairs being organised by Punjab government as fraud where youths are exploited, the SAD on Monday held a protest at the Barnala deputy commissioner office. It demanded action against a company which extracted money from youths in the name of providing them training at a job fair held exactly a year ago. An unemployed Angrej Kaur from Sekha village also joined the protest, saying many girls paid Rs 2,000 each in the name of providing training and no job was given to them. The Akali workers claimed that they had given a complaint to the Barnala SSP last week, demanding action against such firms that exploit youths in the name of providing them jobs. Angrej Kaur, a 23-year-old graduate in humanities, said, “I had gone to a job fair organised by ITI Barnala on February 12-13, 2018, along with Simranjit Kaur of Dhanaula and Jyoti Rani of Barnala. A company from Mohali had given us job offer letters and asked us to go to its Mohali office. When we went there (Mohali) after a few days, we were asked to pay Rs 2,000 each for training before getting jobs. Hoping to get the jobs, we paid the money but have neither been provided any job even after a year nor returned our money.” Former Punjab chief minister Surjit Singh Barnala’ grandson and Akali leader Simar Pratap Singh said, “A few days ago, these girls had approached us and we had given a complaint to the SSP. When no action was taken, we held a protest at the DC office today. We want the government to select companies for job fairs after checking their credentials to stop the exploitation of unemployed youth.” He said if the youth are not provided jobs and action is not taken against such companies, the party will keep on holding protests. Barnala SSP Harjit Singh said preliminary inquiries by the district administratiion officials revealed that these girls had not registered themselves at the job fair. “I have marked the matter to the DSP for probe and appropriate action will be taken,” he said.

Mandsaur - Meerut City Link Express (29019) has been cancelled for four days from Sunday to Wednesday, while Indore Intercity - New Delhi Super-Fast Express (12416) was cancelled on Sunday.

Farmers have alleged the police lathicharged and used water cannons on them when they were protesting over pending sugarcane dues. The district sugarcane department has issued notices to the mills over pending dues and said that it any untoward incident happens at the mahapanchayat, the mills will be held responsible. The face-off continued with farmers gearing up to hold mahapanchayat at Rashidpur Gari village on the outskirts of the village. The demand includes action against the police officials involved in lathicharge on farmers on February 4 who had come to the collectorate to mount pressure for clearing their dues. The police also registered cases against the farmers under section seven of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and some other relevant sections. Addressing a press conference, national convenor of Azad Kisan Union, Rajendra Singh said, “Administration had committed atrocities on the farmers. Their crime was that they were demanding their sugarcane dues of previous year. We are doing our agitation peacefully but police suddenly started beating us. They forced the farmers to run for a kilometre and thrashed them. No farmer was on rampage during the agitation but police slapped cases under section seven of Criminal Law Amendment Act on agitators, which is normally imposed on dreaded criminals. Farmers are ready now to register their protest against this cruelty by holding mahapanchayat.” “Administration and police betrayed the farmers by making false assurance to us. They had assured us that sugarcane dues be cleared by Feb 11 and case against farmers will be withdrawn. Neither case has been withdrawn, nor pending sugarcane dues was cleared given to the farmers,” Singh added. Thousands of farmers are expected to take part in the mahapanchayat with around 20 farmer outfits likely to share the stage, he noted. Accusing the police of trying to crush farmers' voices, Singh alleged that officials raided their homes on Sunday and Monday. Two sugar mills of wave group have so far not paid dues worth Rs 62 crores of the previous year, which has led to 25 protests by farmers. On being asked about the matter, district cane officer, Yashpal Singh, said, “We have served notices to the wave group for not paying dues the farmers. We have given stern warning to them that they would be held responsible for any untoward incident during farmer agitation. There are nine mills in the district. Out which seven have done the dues of previous year and they have also started making payment of current crushing year. Only Bijnor and Chandpur mills have not given previous dues so far.” According to sources, the group was not ready to operate the mills and have not paid the dues. It is believed the group wants to shut these units. ",11 Feb 2019,2019-02-11 00:00:00

She gladly obliged most of them. However, it was her impromptu decision to join her brother and Congress president Rahul Gandhi in lifting the dummy model of Rafale that left many wondering if there is more to her than the striking resemblance to Indira Gandhi. While Rahul rallied behind the 'Chowkidar-hichor-hai' chorus, the Congress eastern UP in-charge firmly held the handle carrying the Rafale jet model. Priyanka arrived with Rahul at 12.25pm on Monday on a four-day visit to the state. The visit is aimed at turning the Congress's fortunes in the state in which it had fared miserably in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections , winning just two of 80 seats in the state. Priyanka spoke largely in gestures, smiles and victory poses. But her Rafale act was an indication that she has shunned the limited role of just nurturing family boroughs of Amethi and Rae Bareli. And as she did, the chorus shifted from jibes on Rafale row to ""Dushmano ki andhi hai, yeh nayi Indira Gandhi hai [Beware rivals, this is the new Indira Gandhi]"". By now, the siblings were in full control of the Lucknow crowd, having eased themselves from a 'rath' to squat on the rooftop of an SUV.

Master plan on the anvil to curb traffic snarls during protests,Master plan on the anvil to curb traffic snarls during protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/master-plan-on-the-anvil-to-curb-traffic-snarls-during-protests/articleshow/67933491.cms,en,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: There would be very few people in the city who had not suffered due to the sudden traffic snarls caused by protests and processions on the MG Road, the arterial road of the city. The city police authorities are working on devising a master plan that would help reduce the chaos on roads owing to such marches and protests. City police commissioner S Surendran said that effective sharing of information will be a key factor for the proposed master plan. “At present, whenever there is a protest or procession on the road, the responsibility of traffic diversion is only on the officials at the local police station in the proximity. Hence, the motorists become aware of diversions only after they have reached close to the spot where action is taking place. This is what creates snarls on the roads,” the commissioner said. For example, motorists going to East Fort from Kesavadasapuram , Sasthamangalam and Poojapura, which are in different directions, become aware of a protest happening in front of the secretariat only after they have reached near the Statue Junction. By that time, it would be too late and all the motorists would be forced to take the same bylanes to avoid the main road. If these motorists knew in advance before entering the MG Road about the protest happening at Statue Junction , they could easily take alternative routes and thus avoid being trapped in snarls, the commissioner elaborated the idea behind the master plan. “Henceforth, we have decided to alert all police stations in the city whenever there is a protest on any of the roads,” the commissioner said. The police personnel on traffic duty under local police stations can initiate measures to warn the motorists. The police have plans to introduce public announcement (PA) systems in major junctions in the city to warn motorists. This is because warning motorists using traffic cops on roads would be a tough task. At present PA systems exist only at a handful of junctions in the city. Majority of them are on junctions along the MG Road. The police also have plans to tie up with radio stations to broadcast messages. The two assistant commissioners of city traffic are entrusted with the task of preparing a master plan. The proposed master plan is just one of the various measures undertaken by the city police to keep the roads safe for motorists and pedestrians. At present, the police are also engaged in the works of installing barricades on medians on busy roads to prevent jaywalking. This is because accidents were frequently being reported owing to pedestrians crossing the road carelessly. Also, the police had been strictly checking vehicles and motorists during the past one week as part of Road Safety Week observance. The special drive concluded on Sunday. According to the police, around 6,000 motorists were booked during this period for various offences such as drunken driving, rash driving and not wearing helmets and seatbelts.

The barrage coming up 25km upstream of the mouth of the Arabian sea was intended to tackle south Gujarat’s severe salinity ingress issues. Gujarat government has now expressed concerns that the proposed barrage may lose all its sweet water “in no time” in the future if the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) continues to notify the barrage as National Waterway-73 meant for large class VII vessels (carrying 2,000 tonne Dead Weight Tonnage) instead of marking it for smaller class III vessels (carrying 500 tonne DWT). The Bhadbhut barrage was announced last year with the promise to improve groundwater quality in upper reaches of the Narmada and to store 600 million cubic metre water for domestic use — almost 400 million litres per day (MLD) for 31 villages and 910 MLD for Dahej industrial water supply. In a letter to the IWAI on January 1 the state government through chief secretary J N Singh has claimed that the whole project will become “impractical” if class VII vessels enter Bhadbhut inland water channel. The reason being that a large amount of water will have to be stored and then released to keep class VII vessels afloat, say sources. Senior government official’s claim that the current 600 cusecs of water released from the Narmada dam is enough to keep class III vessels afloat. For class VII vessels the flow will have to be increased to 1,700 to 2,200 cusecs. IWAI wants that the width of the navigational lock be also increased from 15.5 metres to 18 metres and also the channel length deepened. The state government has further represented in the letter, “In the downstream of the Sardar Sarovar Dam , there is no fresh water inflow for a significantly long period during the year in Narmada river.” Singh has further stated in the letter, “Ground reality is that barring Dahej, there is no possibility of any industrial establishment that can consume large quantity of goods to be navigated through river way,” the government states in the letter. The letter further adds, “Five bridges are there in the upstream of the barrage which can facilitate class-III vessels. The draft in the river is also very low and in case a big navigational facility (class VII vessel) is operated, the precious sweet water reservoir would be emptied in no time.” The IWAI’s decision on August 24 last year also asked Gujarat to make major structural changes to all the five bridges on the Narmada before the barrage to allow large class VII vessels to pass through.

A large number of contractual teachers had reached the city, the hometown of CM Amarinder Singh, to stage protest that took a violent turn when the police used water cannons to disperse them as they tried to march towards Singh's residence. The police later cane charged the protesters during which a number of them got injured. In retaliation, the protesting teachers also tried to break the barricades set up by the police leaving nine cops, including SP (Headquarters) SS Virk injured. The clash took place in front of Baba Buddha Dal school. Patiala SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu and deputy commissioner Kumar Amit immediately rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. SSP said that cops were injured after teachers attacked the police. He said that the police did not resort to canecharge. The teachers have been agitating against the state government's new policy of regularisation in which they are being asked to join on a monthly salary of Rs 15,300. Recently, the Sanjha Adhyapak Morcha and Panjab Bachao Manch had decided to protest under the banner of Adhyapak Sangharsh committee through which a large number of contractual teachers demanded regularisation. Teachers claimed that despite the release of the funds by the ministry of human resource and development (MHRD), the government slashed the salaries of the teachers who didn’t accept its offer on new terms. They claimed that already a number of teachers under RMSA and SSA were working on contractual basis for the past many years and were drawing salaries up to Rs 45,000. Devinder Punia, the co-convener of teachers' union, said, “The government has paid no heed to our demands and very cunningly they made a number of teachers join on new terms and conditions. We have been protesting since long, but chief minister Captain Amarinder has not met us till now. Today, the police cane-charged us leaving over three dozens teachers injured.” The police had prior information about the protest rally and had even appealed the teachers not to protest on the occasion of Basant Panchami. The teachers had, earlier, planned to carry out the protest from Veer Haqiat ground to YPS Chowk but later changed the route near Fountain Chowk, to circumvent the police. The police, on the other hand, shifted their water-cannon vans and anti-riot vehicles to the new spot. Meanwhile, CM Amarinder Singh has assured the teachers and other employees of early resolution of their demands. On Sunday he appealed to the protesters to shun the path of agitation and have patience, as the state government was committed to finding an amicable solution to their pending demands. Singh said the employees must understand that despite the unprecedented financial crises being faced by the state, the government was doing everything in its power to resolve the issues of the employees. He said that agitations will not lead to any constructive solution and talks will soon be held to find a way out. Underlining that all employees, including teachers, were the most intrinsic part of society, the CM assured them that the cabinet sub-committee formed under health minister Brahm Mahindra was already working to find a solution to their demands. The chief minister said that he too would soon meet the representatives of various employees’ bodies to resolve their issues. ",10 Feb 2019,2019-02-10 00:00:00

Kisan Kalyankar, convenor of the forum said, “Since last few years we are demanding roll back of the capital-based valuation system. Citizens are unable to pay the tax which is increasing every year. Moreover, KMC has planned to hike tax in addition to the already increasing tax amount. The system was imposed on us without considering our view. We were told that the amount will be utilised to build roads and develop public amenities. However, we have seen that huge tax is collected by the KMC and no public amenities are developed. We are moving a petition in court seeking scrapping of the capital-based valuation.” Activists from B ward say they will take their demands to the streets if authorities do not respond appropriately. In capital-based value system, the property tax depends on the location. The core areas of the city, with high ready reckoner rates, attract the highest tax. ",10 Feb 2019,2019-02-10 00:00:00

Dr. Madhusudhana Karignoor, state president, IMA, said: “If implemented, this will pave way for money-mined business alone. IMA will stand with students till their demands are fulfilled.” K Uma, state secretary of All India Save Education Committee (AISEC), said: “They claim the government has shortage of funds and hence, the fee hike. But legislatures frequently pass bills increasing their salaries. With this move, many aspirants from lower middle-class and poor families will be deprived of medical education.” Dr Pramod, state president of AIDSO, was elected state convener of the state-level medical and dental students’ forum which was formed to carry forward the movement.

Officials said the strategically important, Se La (La means pass) tunnel project will take the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) around three years to complete. The cost of the project has been pegged at Rs 687 crore. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, ""China's position on the China-India boundary question is consistent and clear-cut. The Chinese government has never recognised the so called 'Arunachal Pradesh' and is firmly opposed to the Indian leader's visit to the East Section of the China-India boundary."" China urges the Indian side to proceed from the overall situation of bilateral relations, respect China's interests and concerns, cherish the momentum of improving relations between the two countries, and refrain from any actions that intensify disputes and complicate the border issue,"" Chunying said using words a little stronger than usual. The proposed all-weather tunnel is expected to help impart a much-needed strategic thrust to Indian military forces against China. ""The project covers a total distance of 12.04 km, with two tunnels of 1,790 and 475 metres. Once completed, the tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang and other forward areas. It will reduce the travelling time from Tezpur to Tawang in a major way. Travellers would be able to avoid the dangerous snow covered Se La top at a height of 13,700 feet,"" said an official. A senior Army officer, who has served a couple of tenures at Se La, in turn, said the road connecting Tenga to Tawang is ""a perpetual struggle"" for military convoys because it frequently remains blocked due to landslides and other factors. The Army is keeping its fingers crossed about the Se La tunnel project, given the huge delays in border infrastructure development as well as the 73 ""strategic"" all-weather roads (totalling 4,643-km) that were identified for construction along the 4,057-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) 20 years ago.

Before his pblic rally, the PM is scheduled to take part in foundation stone laying ceremonies, which are all government functions. The Congress has objected to the venue of these programmes being only a few metres away from the spot where the PM will address the rally. Dharwad Rural District Congress president Anil Kumar Patil has charged that BJP has misused government machinery in the guise of government functions to make its party programme a success. He alleged that several Union government departments have issued a diktat to their employees to be present at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally on Sunday. To substantiate his claims, Patil has released a copy of South Western Railway's order issued to its staff which orders that at least 10 to 15 staff from each department should be present at the venue of the PM’s function. Congress has decided to hold a protest rally in the city just hours before the PM’s rally to demand the resignation of state BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa. Patil said they would take out a rally from Ambedkar Circle to Rani Chennamma Circle. “We have sought police permission for holding the rally. No matter what, we will hold the protest,” he said. Will Cong MLAs skip event? According to Congress sources, since a BJP programme will be held after the government programme near the venue on Sunday, Congress legislators and ministers are reluctant to take part in the government function. However, Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi told reporters that both the venues were selected by the Prime Minister’s Office. “The venue of the government function venue is at quite adistance away from the political rally. Before making any comment, opposition leaders must verify the distance,” he said.

BJP state president Madan Lal Saini was arrested while marching towards the CM residence, along with the BJP leaders and workers. The protest march started at 11am from the BJP headquarters to the Civil Lines , with chanting of slogans against the state government. Police swung into action when the protesters tried to jump the barricades causing injuries to a BJP Mahila Morcha activist Anju Mishra. She sustained fracture in her right hand and was admitted to SMS Hospital. Later, Saini visited the poly trauma ward of the SMS Hospital to meet the injured and assured of all help till she recuperates. Prior to the march, Saini addressed the protesters and said, “It is the duty of the BJP to expose the Congress’ series of blatant lies, that they had spread during the polls. The courting arrest is a reminder to the Congress that the BJP is still a force, and a message for the people of the state that the party stands with them always.” Saini charged the Congress of deceiving farmers by making a hollow promise of waiving the loans in the first 10 days of their government formation. “The promise is still not fulfilled by the government. Our commitment is to ensure that they should either fulfil the promise or apologize to them,” said Saini. He also took the credit for the government starting the loan waiver camps from Friday. “This is due to the pressure from the BJP that they have started the process,” said Saini. The march was attended by senior BJP leaders including Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra, former cabinet minister Arun Chaturvedi, Sanganer MLA Ashok Lahoty and others. Anand Sharma, BJP communications team, claimed that over 10,000 people have attended the protest. “This is a stern message for the Congress that the BJP will not hesitate in going to any extent for the people of Rajasthan ,” said Sharma.

A month ago, ugly clashes had broken out between protesting farmers and the cops when they had tried to enter the mining site. Police had resorted to heavy lathicharge and arrested around 90 farmers. As part of the protest, farmers did not even send their wards to schools. Recently, the Gujarat High Court has ordered the concerned magistrate to initiate criminal proceeding in the atrocity committed by police on farmers or lodged an FIR to investigate the allegations of excesses. Farmers are opposed to limestone mining on the grounds that their fields would be rendered non-fertile. They said the water in their wells has also turned saline as the company digs land 300 foot to 400 foot deep to extract limestone. Bharat Bhil, a local farmer leader, said, “Despite our continuous protests, mining activity continues in the area. We had sent proposed that the government officials, elected representatives of our area and company officials should hold a meeting with us to understand our problem. However, they didn’t pay heed.” District collector Hasmukh Patel said, “I have yet to receive the copy of order but as per my knowledge National Green Tribunal (NGT) has rejected the petition of farmers. We can’t stop mining when the company has obtained necessary permission from state and central government and there is no stay by the court.” ",09 Feb 2019,2019-02-09 00:00:00

Villagers added that no field’s owner allowed them to conduct the last rites and thus, the community decided to stage protest. They kept the dead body on the road and sat on a dharna. The Dalit community members allegedly received threats from the influential people of the village, but nevertheless decided to continue with the protest.

Amid the uproar, where opposition members held up placards of a news report which claimed the then defence secretary had objected to the PMO conducting “parallel negotiations” with the French company, and raised slogans of “chowkidar chor hai”, defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a suo motu statement. “PMO’s periodic inquiry cannot be construed as interference,” she said, accusing the opposition of “not working in the interests of the Indian Air Force”. She dismissed allegations levelled in the news report and said the opposition was “flogging a dead horse” and playing into the hands of vested interests. Sitharaman also alleged that if this was regarded as interference, then Sonia Gandhi running the PMO as chairperson of the National Advisory Council should also be seen in the same light. “Was that not interference?” she asked. She was responding to a united opposition attack in which Congress, TMC, TDP and CPM joined in, demanding the PM’s resignation and a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the Rafale deal. TMC MP Saugata Roy alleged that parallel negotiations were on when the defence ministry’s negotiating committee was handling the matter. He also referred to NSA Ajit Doval as the “notorious NSA” who was conducting parallel negotiations in Paris, “undermining the bargaining power of the government”. “It concerns national security... Modi is destroying the defence of the country and undermining negotiations. Why did the PMO interfere? Rafale stands out to be a biggest scandal,” he added.

Because any small flare up can quickly mutate into a major protest and that will seriously strain our resources,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. The entire focus of the Rajasthan police now rests on Sawai Madhopur. “There is enough reinforcement available for Sawai Madhopur.

Other anti-BJP opposition party leaders (22-odd parties) who have come together on a “Save Democracy” platform to combat the ruling BJP together, are likely to call on the chief minister and TDP chief, making it a rallying point, with the message that the entire spectrum of parties are preparing to take on BJP at the national level together. This show of solidarity will be followed by a “dharna” by West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee between February 13 and 14, as she is planning to bring her protest movement that started in Kolkata last weekend, to Delhi, to ensure that her battle with the centre on the issue of “attack on federalism” is also fought in the national capital and not just at her doorstep. Last Sunday, Banerjee turned “a CBI attempt to raid the Kolkata police commissioner’s residence” into a political stage, where most of the opposition leaders came out and stood with her making it national issue about “the Centre’s strike on the state,” yielding only after a Supreme Court intervention in the matter the next day. What unfurled overnight as the chief minister sat on a “dharna” on the streets of Kolkata, ensured that solidarity among the 22-odd anti-BJP parties found a new cause and reassembly in Delhi before, the nation goes in for elections. Between Banerjee, Naidu and leaders of NCP, RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, JD(S), Left and Congress among others, the opposition hopes to make an impact with its strong presence and clear message to their respective electorate on the eve of the next general elections.

They had immersed themselves in water-filled drums on Wednesday as part of the protests. ND Khanzode, state general secretary of National Home Guard Police Association, said the government had sacked 12,000 home guards in last few months on various grounds. “285 guards were sacked in the city alone. We demand that they should be taken back immediately,” he added. Khanzode further said that the state government had introduced physical tests for home guards every three years. “How can guards who are over 45 pass these tests. Such tests should be held at the time of recruitment and not after that. Moreover, the government has ruled that a home guard will be recruited only for 12 years. What will the persons whose tenure is completed do after that,” he added. State president Suresh Dudhe said home guards’ work was similar to that of police personnel and hence they should be given equal pay and perks. “There should be 50% reservation for home guards in police recruitment,” he added. He further said that instead of taking cognisance of the demands, the home ministry has issued orders to terminate the services of guards who were participating in the agitation. Home guard district commandant Devendra Katolkar said finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had held two meetings with the union leaders. “He is following up the issue. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is expected to convene a meeting on the issue within 10-15 days. A positive decision is expected,” he added. Khanzode and Dudhe trashed Katolkar’s claims. “Mungantiwar and minister of state for home Ranjit Patil had met us some months ago, but did not take any decision. Mungantiwar is the finance minister and has got nothing to do with the home department. How can he solve our problems? General elections are likely to be announced in the first week of March. If the CM takes his own time in convening the meeting, how will he take a policy decision after code of conduct comes into force,” they said. ",08 Feb 2019,2019-02-08 00:00:00

Their claims appeared to have some credence as seven Congress MLAs — including the four rebels allegedly holed up in Mumbai — defied a party whip and remained absent on the second day of the budget session. When the legislative assembly met at noon on Thursday, BJP members immediately began protesting in the well of the House. They created pandemonium, repeatedly shouting “Go back CM”, “Step Down CM”, “Down, down government” and “No unity, no majority”. BJP leaders justified the protests, contending that the state government is a minority government and it does not have the required numbers. Countering this, Krishna Byre Gowda, rural development and panchayat raj minister, shouted: “The BJP should move a no-confidence motion if they feel that the Congress-JD(S) alliance does not have majority to run the government.” The agitating MLAs did not pay heed to speaker KR Ramesh Kumar's request to resume their seats, prompting him to adjourn proceedings for 10 minutes. When the House met again, BJP leaders continued with their protests, forcing Kumar to adjourn proceedings till 12.30pm Friday when chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will present the 2019-2020 state budget. “This is a new chapter in the history of Karnataka assembly proceedings,” Kumar said before adjourning the House. “It should not have occurred, but it is happening and not without reason.” The legislative council also witnessed similar scenes with BJP members trooping into the well of the House and raising slogans against the government. The House also saw a “placard war” with both BJP and JD(S)-Congress coalition leaders holding posters, running down each other’s party. The BJP placards in Kannada read: “10% commission government! After Puttrangshetty, who?”, “Hindu virodhi government”, ""Wakf board scamsters should step down"" and ""CM with no confidence step down”. The ruling coalition partners placards read: “Modi-Shah duo detrimental to Indian democracy"" and “Corruption is the ethos of BJP”.

What is preventing them from doing so?” he said. But BS Yeddyurappa, opposition leader of the assembly, said, “We will not move a no-confidence motion. It’s not about the numbers. We are protesting because the coalition government does not have the moral right to continue in office and present a new budget when their own MLAs are defying a whip and absconding.

North Goa Rent-a-Cab Association vice-president, Nitesh Chodankar, said a lamani residing in Candolim had applied for a licence to start a car rental business with the backing of Lobo. “The car rental business is one of the last things still left with Goans. We fought for so many years to get the rent-a-cab business legalised because Goans are running it. All this time, the MLA never supported us. Now that it’s legal, he is supporting non-Goans,” Chodankar said. “We will never allow this.” A large number of activists from Calangute and other areas also joined the morcha. Speakers at the meeting vowed to intensify their stir in case the lamani is granted the licence. ",08 Feb 2019,2019-02-08 00:00:00

This comes a day after they had deferred the decision following promises that all pending sugarcane dues would be met by February 11. The mahapanchayat will protest the police high handedness against farmers when they tried to mass immolate themselves over pending sugarcane dues two days ago. Talking to TOI, national convenor of Azad Kisan Union, Rajendra Singh , said, “Administration has misled us. During the lathicharge, police have detained nine farmers including me. Later, officials held talks with us and assured us that dues will be cleared by Feb 11 and no sections will be imposed on the farmers. But they have registered a case against the farmers under serious charges. It came to our knowledge that one side was pacifying the farmers by making false assurances, while a few govt officials gave go ahead for further action.” The farmers union leader said that they had interacted with their peers and other organisations on the issue and have then decided to hold the mahapanchayat. “Anger is seeping among the farmers. Now it is matter of self-respect. We had have interaction with the farmers and some farmer organisations over the issue. Extent of the atrocities by police can be assessed that they did not spare even the old farmers and police made them run around one kilometre, thrashing them. After all we have decided to hold ‘Kisan Bachao Mahapanchaya’. Our demand is that all cases be withdrawn from the farmers and sugarcane dues be cleared by Feb 11. Apart from this, officials indulged in applying lathicharge be suspended immediately.” Singh added. The strategy, Singh said would involve inviting farmer outfits from other state and allowing them to be part of the mahapanchayat. The movement may prove to be a big jolt for the BJP in the upcoming polls. Opposition parties like the Samajwadi party are planning to raise the issue in the Vidhan Sabha. SP MLA from Nagina, Manoj Paras said that he would raise the issue in the assembly as the police action reflected the anti-farmer attitude of both the government and the police.

Besides, journalists covering the assembly session on Friday and scribes covering Prime Minister’s Modi’s public meeting at Raigarh will wear black badges as a mark of protest, he added. The move to organise such a protest comes a day after journalists in the state capital went on an ambulance and wore helmets to cover a Dharna, organised by the BJP to protest against Congress government’s alleged politics of vendetta . Journalists, covering the event, wore colourful helmets as a form of protest against the last Saturday’s incident in which BJP thrashed a local journalist for filming an argument between Raipur district BJP president Rajiv Agrawal and former legislator Nande Sahu. After thrashing the journalist, the BJP leaders also forced the scribe to delete the video. Although Raipur district BJP president Rajiv Agrawal and three others were arrested in connection with the incident, journalists in the state capital are on the path of agitation, demanding a law to protect journalists. Besides, the journalists are agitated as the BJP did not take any action at party level against its leaders, who allegedly assaulted the scribe. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Raigarh to address a public meeting on Friday. Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has written a letter to Prime Minister Modi to re-schedule his visit to Chhattisgarh on Friday as his government is scheduled to present the state’s budget for fiscal 2019-20 in the assembly. “I am very keen to welcome you on your arrival in Chhattisgarh.

The family members of the man who was cremated demanded the body back. Heavy police force has been deployed to defuse the situation. According to police sources, on Sunday, a body was found in Baraut area which was brought to the post mortem house. Later, it was identified as Manoj Tyagi , 46, a resident of Mehmudpur village in Dhampur town of Bijnor. On Tuesday, another body was brought in. This was of Ashok Kumar , 29, who had met with an accident and was resident of Bhabisa village in Shamli . On Wednesday, Tyagi’s relatives came first but the staff at the post mortem house handed over the body of Ashok who took it away and cremated it in Dhampur. When Ashok’s family came to know about the goof-up they sat on a protest and even turned violent jostling with the staff so much so that police had to be called in. According to Krishanpal, Ashok’s brother-in-law, “This is a gross negligence on the part of police and hospital staff. They have become so heartless that they don’t even care about the pain one has to go through in such situations. We want the body back come what may.” Dilip Singh, circle officer of Baghpat, said, “An inquiry has been set up in the incident. So far, it has come to light that Tyagi’s relatives had identified the body but during wrapping up of the same, cleaning staff made the goof-up. To make matters worse, Tyagi’s body had been cremated by the time his relatives were contacted in Dhampur.” Later, Tyagi’s family again reached the post mortem house to fetch the original body. Ashutosh Tyagi, deceased’s relative, said, “We were informed about our uncle, Manoj’s death three days ago and the body was already in a bad shape. After identification was complete and body was handed over to us we simply took it directly to the cremation site for the last rites after reaching our village in Dhampur. We got a call from police when it was already engulfed in flames. Now, we are rushing back to Baghpat again to bring the right body.” SP Baghpat, Shailesh Kumar Pandey said, “This is a strange case. The bodies were in different drawers one above the other and goof up seems to have happened during delivery. That the body was consigned to flames without performing last rites is surprising. Ashok’s family will be handed over the ashes by Tyagi’s family and an inquiry has been set up.” ",07 Feb 2019,2019-02-07 00:00:00

Though no severe waterlogging was reported, the hailstorm in the evening forced drivers to stop their vehicles to avoid skidding on the thick layer of the icy pellets or slow down considerably. The situation was compounded by protesting youngsters march in protest from Red Fort to Jantar Mantar. There was misery for travellers on the Delhi-Noida route too after a fire at a hospital there. Some roads, especially those from Mehrauli to Gurgaon and Mehrauli to Badarpur, saw jams due to blockades and potholes that emerged after the rains. Traffic jams were reported on Noida Link Road and DND Flyway after UP Police blocked the flyway approach in Noida’s Sector 12 to allow the shifting of patients from Metro Hospital and Heart Institute to another facility after the fire. The blockade, which lasted almost two hours, had a cascading effect on traffic, and the snarl stretched to Delhi side of the flyway. Minor waterlogging in Mehrauli-Badarpur and Lajpat Nagar in south Delhi resulted in the average road speed dipping to below 15 kmph. The additional personnel deployed for the Road Safety Campaign diverted traffic to parallel passages, but the sheer vehicular volume soon choked the roads. Police officers alerted commuters to the diversions through messages on social media and variable display boards. Police said the hailstorm proved a hurdle in south and central Delhi after many cars idled on the roads, fearing collisions and crashes due to the slippery surface. In the afternoon, a protest by youngsters over unemployment resulted in gridlocks on Netaji Subhas Marg, Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, Ranjit Singh Flyover and Tolstoy Marg. Their procession caused snarls on Deshbandhu Gupta Marg and Rani Jhansi Road too. Some roads, especially those from Mehrauli to Gurgaon and Mehrauli to Badarpur, saw jams due to blockades and potholes that emerged after the rains. Heavy vehicles moved at a snail’s pace on these roads. Water logging near Anand Parbat created a similar situation on Rohtak Road in central Delhi. ",08 Feb 2019,2019-02-08 00:00:00

While the meeting expressed gratitude to the finance minister and Prime Minister for announcing the creation of a separate department for fisheries, a resolution condemned the continuous attacks on fishermen by the Sri Lankan naval force at sea. It said Cyclone Gaja had devastated not just farmers but fishermen too. Most of them had lost their belongings, particularly fishing gear including net and box. The government must announce proper compensation to all fishers based on their loss. The meeting also asked the district administration to extend loan facility up to Rs 25,000 to develop their fishing activities. A large number of fishermen were struggling to get their membership card to enrol themselves with the welfare board. Many had been waiting for months and years after duly applying for the same because of the lethargic approach of the officials, the association alleged.

"Mamata calls off dharna, to take protest to national stage","Mamata calls off dharna, to take protest to national stage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cm-calls-off-dharna-to-take-protest-to-national-stage/articleshow/67859676.cms,en,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday claimed “moral victory” over the Supreme Court order and called off her 70-hour “satyagraha” in the evening in the presence of TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu. She also announced a “Save-India, Save-Constitution” dharna in Delhi after a meeting of opposition parties on February 13 and 14. Banerjee had started the dharna at Metro Channel on Sunday evening — terming it an apolitical “satyagraha” — demanding an end to the misuse of central agencies by the Narendra Modi government. That followed a visit by CBI officers to the residence of Kolkata Police commissioner Rajeev Kumar “for questioning” him. The chief minister had immediately thrown her weight behind the commissioner. On Tuesday, Banerjee’s “moral victory” was because the apex court had stopped the CBI from taking any “coercive step” against Kumar. “This dharna is a victory for the Constitution and democracy; so, let us end it today,” Banerjee said. “We are so grateful and obliged to the Supreme Court,” said Banerjee, who appeared tense and seemed to be under pressure while sitting on the dais before the order went out at 11am. “It will strengthen the morale of the officials. The state and central service officers should respect each other. The central government has its jurisdictions and should not interfere in the state’s business. Central agencies are coming to arrest members of state agencies without any consultation with the state government. Don’t you think it disturbs the law and order machinery of the state? Whatever the state government has said is absolutely correct and we welcome the order,” she added. Accusing the Centre of misusing CBI, she said: “All political opponents are being harassed.... Tomorrow they will say arrest Mamata Banerjee because she wears hawai chappals.” The chief minister even remarked that it was good that Kumar has been asked to appear for the CBI probe in Shillong. “Good,” she said. “He works round the year. This will give him two days of relaxation.” Earlier in the day, the Trinamool Congress chief fished out the purported tell-all letter in 2013 from Saradha boss Sudipta Sen, now in jail, to substantiate her political vendetta charge against the Modi government. The Saradha boss, in the letter, had alleged that Congress-turned-BJP minister from Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, had taken money from him, a charge the minister has refuted. The letter also mentions the name of BJP junior minister Babul Supriyo. Banerjee referred to the letter — terming Supriyo the “Rose of Rose Valley” — and said that CBI had only arrested leaders of her party. Congress leader and lawyer Kapil Sibal also raised questions about the role of the “Trinamool man now in BJP”, without naming Mukul Roy, once considered the No. 2 man in the Trinamool Congress. Banerjee also had Prime Minister Narendra Modi directly in her crosshairs. “I am the one raising my voice against Narendra Modi. Why is he after us? His name was dragged in several cases like Godhra. Should I ask what had happened to Haren Pandya [home minister of Gujarat, murdered in 2003]?... Only I talk about these things. So they want to kill me.... They [the Central government] want to control all the agencies, including the state agencies also. PM, you resign from Delhi and go back to Gujarat. One man government, one party government is there,” Banerjee said. The CM poured scorn on UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who addressed a rally in Purulia on Tuesday. “He does not know from which seat he will be able to seek re-election. Isi liye Bangal mein ghumta rehta hai,” she said of him. The dharna may have been termed “apolitical”, but it became a rallying point for all 23 opposition party leaders, who had come down to Kolkata only a fortnight ago on January 19 to pledge support for a united opposition. While RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav, DMK MP Kanimozhi, TDP chief Chandrababu Nadu, Samajwadi leader Akhilesh’s emissary Kiranmoy Nanda came down to Kolkata in solidarity with Banerjee’s sit-in protest, a host of leaders including Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal spoke to her over the phone during the dharna expressing unity against the “one-man” show. The immediate takeaway for the opposition from the dharna is that the anti-Modi chorus grew stronger, and got heard across the country. “The sit-in protest has been a huge success,” said the TDP chief on Tuesday. “We have got national attention through this dharna. Even the NDA couldn’t ignore our voice. Democracy is in danger. This time it is even worse than the Emergency.” He announced that the opposition would come together whenever there is such an affront, and appealed to the people of Bengal to give all 42 Lok Sabha seats from Bengal to Banerjee.

""Though we are qualified and do the same work which assistant professors do, we are paid less and are not entitled to any terminal benefits which full-time teaching staff enjoy,"" said P Shanmugha Perumal, one of the protesting teaching fellows.

However, the teaching fellows pointed out that the university had earlier absorbed several teachers on contract as permanent faculty members. Against this backdrop, the TFs protested on Tuesday evening reiterating their demands. In response, the university agreed to look into the issue. ",05 Feb 2019,2019-02-05 00:00:00

We had warned the administration about our mass immolation. But administration was mocking the farmers. When we easily entered collectorate, officials were laughing at us. Farmers can be arrested or stopped outside the collectorate but they did not do so and resorted batons to. Around 50 farmers received injuries who are undergoing treatment in private hospitals. We are to get medical of the injured done. Later a case will be filed against the administration and police officials indulged in the clash,” Singh added.

Amidst tight police security and the presence of a large crowd of parents, the school management erected the four gates, despite protests by locals. At one stage, the situation even threatened to go out of control, but prudent handling of the situation by the police and administrative officials led to the warring parties arrive at a reconciliation over the contentious issues. Trouble began a few days back when a student suffered injuries after being hit by a motorcycle while playing on the school playground. This prompted the management to erect gates at all the four access points to the school. A few locals, however, resisted the move as they used the school playground as a shortcut. The management began the work Monday morning amidst the presence of a large number of parents. Sensing trouble, a large posse of policemen was deployed at the site to ensure law and order. Dy SP Uttam Raut Dessai, executive magistrate, Dattaraj Gauns Dessai, and police inspectors of Sanguem , Quepem and Curchorem, oversaw the situation. Despite loud protests from locals, led by councillor Piedade Diniz, the work was completed. An assurance given by the president of the school management, Pradip Kakodkar, that pedestrian access for locals would be allowed, failed to placate the agitated locals. Chief officer, CCMC, Kapil Phadte convened a meeting of the management with the local councillor and law enforcement agencies. A consensus solution finally emerged with the school management agreeing to deploy security guards at the gates round-the-clock, permitting pedestrian entry to local residents.

As per the decision arrived at stakeholders’ meeting held in December 2018, M C Dathan, scientific adviser to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, and district collector K Vasuki were to visit the site on Monday. The decision to put off the site visit has been reportedly triggered by direction from state government that no action shall be taken at Peringamala until elections were held. It is also learnt that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is keen on getting results from a similar project being proposed in Kozhikode before it is emulated in other parts of the state. The pilot project is being implemented in Kozhikode The members of the protest council had upheld the demand that district administration and authorities may first inspect the site before proceeding with the plan. The proposal had sparked off deep resentment among the residents of villages around Peringamala and the action council had undertaken mass processions demanding cancellation of the plan. Peringamala is one among the seven spots identified by state government for setting up the waste-to-energy plant. Unlike other spots, which have been earmarked for the project, Peringamala is an area of great ecological importance and marked by the presence of waterbodies and forests. The inhabitants in this area, who are hugely dependent on natural resources, have been on a protest mode ever since the announcement of the plan to set up the plant. While the state government is uncertain about Peringamala being the right choice for waste-to-energy plant using a new technology which has no precedents in the state, a section of top bureaucrats has been aggressively pushing for waste-to-energy models in the state. Sources said that the land survey will also be put on hold. The district administration was earlier directed to carry out a drone survey in the area but again it was cancelled, reportedly following the intervention of office of the chief minister. The drone survey was planned to assess the extent of land which could be used for setting up the plant and to study human settlements around the area. Officials with the department of agriculture said that they are yet to receive any official communication regarding transfer or utilization of land for other purposes. The farm area at Peringamala spreads over 120 acres of which 100 acres are owned by the department of agriculture and 20 acres have been taken on lease from department of forests for a period of 99 years. Around 300 families are scattered across various settlements like Pethalakarikkakom, Panniyottukadavu, Venkattamoodu, Adiparambu within 3km radius of Peringamala agri farm. The farm employs over 100 labourers from different panchayats. Sources said that LDF has come under pressure at Peringamala with protest mounting from all corners demanding cancellation of the project. The state government was recently forced to modify its order, which sanctioned 5MW waste-to-energy plants in the state, after no bids were received even after extending the date for submission in 2018. KSIDC, the implementing agency of the project had to revise the project structure. ",05 Feb 2019,2019-02-05 00:00:00
