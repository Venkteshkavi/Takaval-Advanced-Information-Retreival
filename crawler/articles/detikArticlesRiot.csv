This verdict has the potential to further heat up the fierce fighting that is taking place between ethnic groups in Rakhine and the Myanmar military. As reported by AFP, Tuesday (03/19/2019), the verdict against Aye Maung, former Chair of the National Arakan Party, was read out in Sittwe, Rakhine Tuesday (3/19) local time. Myanmar security forces are trying to appease hundreds of Aye Maung supporters who waited outside the court when he was taken to a police car after being convicted. During his time as politician and party leader, Aye Maung was known for his hard-line views on Muslim minorities Rohingyadi Rakhine. The Rakhine ethnic group led by Aye Maung is an ethnic Buddha.googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); By a Myanmar court, he was found guilty of charges treason and indictment made slander related to an incitementous speech in January 2018, the day before deadly riots broke out in Rakhine.

Last night after Aye Maung&#39;s call, the demonstrators at Rakhine had occupied the government building. The police opened fire at that time and killed seven people. Aye Maung and his colleague, writer Wai Hin Aung - who also gave a speech at the same rally - were detained a few days later. &quot;Both Dr. Aye Maung and writer Wai Hin Aung were each sentenced to 20 years in prison ... for high treason charges and each two years in prison for slandering the country, &quot;said lawyer Wai Hin Aung, Aye Nu Sein, to theAFP. The Rakhine region continued to be beset by violence and hatred. A brutal military operation in 2017 forced 740 thousand Rohingya Muslim minorities to flee to Bangladesh.

This is the oppression and bullying of the Rakhine ethnic people,&quot; shouted one of the female supporters in court. In recent weeks, the Myanmar military fought fiercely with Arakan Army (AA), an armed group that claims to represent the Rakhine ethnic group. AA launched an attack on police posts in early January that killed 13 police. A similar attack earlier this month killed 9 other police officers. (Nvc / fdn) rakhinemyanmarrakhine statemakar"

Kenangan dan Sesal Rekan Aktivis soal Andi Arief yang Terjerat Narkoba,https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4454048/kenangan-dan-sesal-rekan-aktivis-soal-andi-arief-yang-terjerat-narkoba,,https://awsimages.detik.net.id/community/media/visual/2019/03/04/01d2a9aa-a196-4220-bd97-16cb6ee68340_169.jpeg?w=780&q=90,"Jakarta- Before entering the world of politics, Andi Arief was an activist who was keen to act until 1998. Arndi Arief&#39;s arrest due to drugs received a response from his fellow ex-activists.Andi Arief was known to be educated at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences of Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta. Kala became Chairperson of the UGM FISIP Student Senate from 1993 to 1994, with a number of student activists forming the Student Political Rights Enforcement Committee (Tegaklima). In 1998, Andi was one of a dozen student activists who were kidnapped for being seen as endangering the New Order regime before finally being released.

As is known, Budiman and Andi Arief are now in two different camps in the 2019 Presidential Election. &quot;What is the pleasure of drugs, bro? Isn&#39;t it more enjoyable to discuss big ideas from the minds of big people and ourselves and make them happen in society? You have chosen your way is by choosing what kind of friends around you. Sad and hope that the accusation is not true, &quot;Budiman wrote on Monday (03/04/2019) at 3:35 p.m. WIB. The abbreviations in cuitan Budiman have been adjusted. Not like this, when 25 years ago we debated in boarding houses in Sendowo UGM, when we planned a lot of big things for Indonesia right? I try to stay on my path, but you choose friends who have never bet your life with you. They come when they are happy - Budiman Sudjatmiko (IG: budimaninovator) (@budimandjatmiko) March 4, 2019Budiman remembers the days of being an activist when he was a student. Until finally, Andi and Budiman chose a different path in politics. &quot;It&#39;s not like this when we debated in boarding houses at Sendowo UGM 25 years ago, when we planned a lot of big things for Indonesia right? I tried to stay on my path, but you chose friends &quot;friends who never bet their lives with you. They come at a time of pleasure,&quot; he said. &quot;The road we used to go along with was the Way of the Sword. He only deserved to be crowned victory or defeat because of conviction. Not by defeat due to silliness. It didn&#39;t even deserve to be crowned victory due to coincidences, Ndi ... We are not that freaky. Previously ... &quot;continued Budiman. Read also: Narcotics Arrested, Andi Arief Assessed 6 Days at BNN Poetry The Budiman received many replies. When he replied to one of the netizens&#39; accounts, he claimed to lose confidence when a friend was trapped in drugs. &quot;I was sad but amazed that there were friends who took certain political steps who were brave though the opposite. But being stuck with things like drugs made a part of my trust and esteem injured, &quot;said Budiman. Not only Budiman, another 1998 activist, Nazar Patria, also commented on the arrest of Andi Arief. Through writing on Facebook, Nezar shared his friendship with Andi Arief to his figure when he became an activist. &quot;For me personally, AA is still a friend, and so it continues. We often differ in attitude and choice, and have their own determination in that matter. I aware in the midst of the chaos leading up to the election like this write a comment about a friend who seems to be the enemy of everyone is unpopular, all will be in the frame &quot;us or them&quot;. Everything can seem wrong, even if there is a saint who can really walk on the water, his detractors would sneer: &quot;He walked, because he could not swim.&quot; I just wanted to judge my friend, Andi Arief, justly. That&#39;s all, &quot;Nezar wrote on Facebook. Read also: Portrait of Andi Arief, Starting Arrested by the New Order Regime Until the Case of Drugs Here follows the writing of Nezar Patria in full: I know this is a useless note: Andi Arief was arrested by the police on charges of using methamphetamine, and whatever my comments about the other side of AA might be seen as a defense. But I suspect he did not ask to be defended. I believe he will dare to face the worst risk of what he did. I want to say that we should be fairer to someone who is being cornered. Photographs of his arrest spread and were viral in WA. I can&#39;t bear to see it. Of course there is a reason why the image went viral. AA is the &quot;main attacker&quot; in Prabowo&#39;s camp. He repeatedly fired issues that made an uproar. From about cardboard dowry to container ballot boxes. He was reviled and praised. The haters said he was a &quot;hoax spreader drunkard&quot;. His admirers said he was &quot;a scathing critic of power&quot;. It depends on where they stand, and who they support. I think AA might not need to label it all. A friend said he had a strong political fiber, and would work according to the political mission mandated to him. If only yesterday the Democrats were close to Jokowi&#39;s camp, then he would be in front of the &quot;destroyer&quot; that attacked Prabowo. He would be as noisy as a bullet he had shot into the camp with a &quot;cardboard general&quot;. For AA, playing politics is the same as softball matches, his favorite sport. I know him for a long time, since we were students at UGM and together moved a network of pro-democracy students in various cities in the early 1990s and together entered the list of activists who were kidnapped by the Rose Team 1998. Therefore, although we have different choices, friendship ties are still quite good. We argued and probably would not greet for a while because of the different paths. But a cup of coffee and hard-to-put out memories sometimes weaves what is torn. As a friend, AA is a good friend. He cared about his troubled friend, he generously gave part of his salary to a friend who was sick and got misfortune. No matter what direction, hate or adore it. When I was trapped in a truce that was jammed in the interior of Aceh, when the TNI fiercely fought GAM at that time, he sent a short message after seeing the news about it on television: &quot;Come back to Jakarta soon. You don&#39;t die first&quot;. I read it while smiling wryly. As a student in Yogyakarta, he was one of the &quot;stars&quot; on the Fisipol campus. Often writing in local newspapers, skilled in discussion, and fierce in the free speech demonstration. We together built a very popular action organization at that time at UGM, the Student Political Rights Enforcement Committee (Tegaklima) which later became the backbone for the development of a larger and more serious movement, Indonesian Student Solidarity for Democracy (SMID). When the 27 July Event 1996 erupted (this is an introduction to the escalation of the politics of the fall of the New Order dictatorship), and SMID was accused of being the mastermind behind the riots and labeled a banned organization, AA suddenly appeared at a press conference in Yogya, which was secretly organized, and after giving a stirring statement , he disappeared again with his friends. Jakarta was furious because at the press conference AA knocked out all versions of the New Order&#39;s accusations. He, then Chairman of the SMID, was number one after Budiman Sudjatmiko and his PRD friends were arrested. Various &quot;hoaxes&quot; emerged, that the young people were communist incarnations, which of course the public responded to as ridiculous political slapstick. YB Mangunwijaya once wrote a column in a magazine when the accusation came out, and he gave an example of how the AA who conducted the secret press conference wearing a softball shirt was accused of being weird. &quot;How is it possible for the youngsters who have military faces to be communists?&quot;, So Father Mangun wrote. AA has since led the underground PRD network. He is very fierce. His life is 24 hours politics. Until everything ended in 1998. After 1998, many of the former student activists chose their own paths. Some go on to PhD, some become entrepreneurs, journalists, and of course politicians. AA chooses a political path, and he consciously lives it with various risks. I know that many are annoyed with his actions, although many also praise his maneuvers. Of course there are many that I don&#39;t know too, for example, how can he end up with what was reported these days. For me personally, AA is still a friend, and so it continues. We often have different attitudes and choices, and each has their own determination in that matter. I realized that in the midst of the chaos leading up to the election like this I wrote a comment about a friend who seemed to be the enemy of everyone was unpopular. All will enter the &quot;us or them&quot; frame. Everything can seem wrong, even if there is a saint who can really walk on the water, his detractors will sneer: &quot;He walked, because he could not swim.&quot; I just wanted to judge my friend, Andi Arief, fairly.

The culprit is &quot;unscrupulous&quot; FPI member. The victim was a journalist from Indonesia and two Indonesian VJCNNs - two media that had been very serious in covering the activities of the group 212 which was born three years ago. The event followed by persecution of journalists took place precisely when thousands of Muslims and Muslims were devoted to worship, pray for the good of the nation. They &quot;accidentally&quot; carried out violent steps against three journalists on duty near the main stage. Because of this, they found a &quot;pickpocket&quot; in the midst of a crowd of worshipers. Reflexively the journalists around that place took pictures of this event, because it was an interesting event to be reported. However, the FPI refused to take pictures in the incident, causing a commotion because they shouted, forcing them to delete all the videos that the journalists recorded, by shouting, threatening, pushing, and even journalists. Satria Kusuma was dragged like a &quot;thief&quot; brought into tenda.googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); Satria Kusuma was injured in several parts of his body due to a blow, and after 40 minutes was released, he reported to office cct. Here is the report: &quot;I took pictures because I instinctively thought it was a big event, in the midst of the humiliation of a group of FPI members shouting and dragging me into a closed room, I was interrogated, bullied, tied and even beaten, because I initially refused to I did not feel afraid, but their violence against me, in my opinion was too excessive, until finally I deleted not only coverage of the arrest of the &quot;pickpocket&quot;, but also other coverage, including interviews with one of the Munajat participants. &quot;Indonesian TV VJCNN, Endra Rezaldi , received the same treatment, was interrogated and was forcefully forced to delete the video in his camera. The violence subsided after they announced that they had participated in covering FPI when delivering disaster relief in Palu last year. The journalists were later released without their apologies. When I heard the news, I was surprised, because I had a different experience when in the events of 411 in 2016, I was in Penjaringan to meet the Indonesian national team there. I became an eyewitness when there were a group of violent citizens who started burning several stalls on the banks of the Penjaringan River and then headed towards Ahok&#39;s house (then Deputy Governor of DKI), shouting &quot;Burn! Burn!&quot; and pushed forward. Dozens of police and soldiers tried to block, but lost a lot. In that critical moment, I witnessed a group of FPI Warriors coming using dozens of motorbikes driving out the demonstrators. I was surprised, but felt grateful that in the end FPI was able to drive away those who tried to riot. Well, when I heard of the incident on February 21, 2019 that night and heard about journalists from the Indonesian National Intelligence Agency, I was angry and regretted the lawless treatment of journalists. Fortunately soon after Elvan Dany and several leadership leaders invited Satria Kusuma to report to the Matraman Central Police Station. The police station conducted interrogations and post mortem studies at the RSCM. It was only in the morning that all the processes were finished. I regretted that the disturbance disturbed the hundreds of thousands of people who were praying all night long, graduating at the National Monument. But I also regret violence against journalists. The duty of journalists to report on what it is, without being added or reduced in excess. They represent the public, readers and viewers. Therefore it is inappropriate if they are disturbed especially in their duties to get injured. I am grateful that the reaction from fellow media is very large, and the Press Council took a joint step with PWI, AJI, the IJTI compact reacted to resolve this problem legally. Agus Sudibyo, one of the members The Press Council, said there was the best way to solve persecution problems. In terms of the Basic Press Law it is referred to as the Restorative Justice Principle in resolving press disputes. &quot;For cases of violations of the principle of press freedom, a new one can be considered an out-of-law solution insofar as there is good intentions from the perpetrator to realize his mistake, apologize and promise not repeating the mistake, this mechanism is not the same as peace, because what happens is not peace, but a settlement outside the court.There is still justice for the victim, but if the perpetrator has no intention of admitting mistakes and apologies, the restorative principle is irrelevant.
