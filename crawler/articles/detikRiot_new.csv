Eggi then explained the meaning of Article 160 of the Criminal Code which became the basis for reporting Supriyanto. &quot;Failure to understand is about people power which is not included in the category of article 160 referred to in the report. Because article 160 has already had a judicial review with the addition of the phrase being a material offense. This means that material offense must be proven as a result. &quot;Because of the category of criminal law, I use my legal rights on the basis of article 220 regarding the back report. Can report back because it does not include criminal acts.

Well, towards that, of course the reporter understands that the advocate cannot be criminalized or sued civilly, which is stipulated in article 16 of the Act &quot;Law Number 18 of 2003 concerning Advocates,&quot; he said. &quot;Advocates cannot be criminalized. And our clients speak in their positions of duty as advocates and people power that are interpreted to maintain voices or polling stations in each region, from Sabang to Merauke, the people must guard them with the power of people power, to avoid these frauds, &quot;he continued. Furthermore, Pitra explained the meaning of people power delivered by Eggi is the power of the people. In Pitra&#39;s understanding, Eggi called for people power so that there would be no cheating in the 2019 election. &quot;This is not to be misunderstood by people power to create riots. People power is the power of the people. People&#39;s strength is that, keep cheating, that is by guarding polling stations. , guarding the ballots, so that there are no frauds that have occurred in Malaysia, right? &quot; Based on these arguments, Pitra said that the report made by Supriyanto was full of slanderous elements.

Actually, what do investors pay attention to when they want to invest their capital in a country that is currently in elections?

So investors see how the election procedure must be in accordance with the constitution and run well.

Then the question of ethnicity, religion, race and inter-group (SARA) is also a concern of investors. Because usually this issue will stick out before and during the election. &quot;But if there is no physical violence, usually they (investors) consider the conditions to be stable,&quot; he explained. Furthermore, the problem of corruption is also an assessment, then the issue of the issue of money politics which is intense when elections also affect investor confidence. Investors also look at those who do not accept defeat until they take to the streets and act unconstitutionally. Though this action can be minimized by complying with the procedure. For example if you do not agree with the decision of the General Election Commission (KPU) you can sue through the Constitutional Court, so that the debate can occur legally. &quot;But if the debate during this period is released by way of demonstrations on the road, this has the potential to create social unrest and this perception becomes negative in the eyes of investors,&quot; he said.

Indonesia-China Relations: Future Leader's Sensitive Points,Hubungan Indonesia-China: Titik Sensitif Pemimpin Mendatang,https://news.detik.com/dw/d-4513655/hubungan-indonesia-china-titik-sensitif-pemimpin-mendatang,id,"Jakarta - Being one of the largest economic powers in Asia and among the most important trading partner countries for Indonesia, does not necessarily make China popular among conservative leaners in Indonesia. A number of projects that hold large investments from China were highlighted and controversy. The fast train project worth 5.9 billion US dollars is cooperating with China Development Bank for example. This project has been criticized a lot and is considered redundant because it is considered as many other mass transportation alternatives that are cheaper to connect the two cities. The president was considered too soft in facing investors from the bamboo curtain country. This strong partnership in the economic field does not only make Chinese names fragrant in the eyes of the Indonesian public. Prejudice and discrimination Economic cooperation often reported by a number of media in Indonesia is about increasing the imbalance of trade balance between Indonesia-China and the issue of invasion of workers from that country to various regions in Indonesia which will seize employment opportunities for local workers. Prejudice against ethnic Chinese has indeed taken root since the days of colonialism. But in the New Order period this prejudice entered a new phase related to the eruption of the G30S / PKI event. During the 1960s there were riots with ethnic Chinese victims because they were considered to support communism, one of which was the Red Bowl in West Kalimantan. After Suharto came to power, the New Order government then repressed a large number of people with ethnic Chinese backgrounds. All things that are Chinese in nature such as writing, people&#39;s names and celebrations of culture are prohibited from being celebrated. Even people with ethnic Chinese backgrounds cannot work in government and politics. As a result, many of them then decided to trade and were eventually accused of creating economic inequalities that triggered racial riots. Although the discriminatory regulations were abolished during the reign of President Abdurrahman Wahid, anti-Chinese sentiments have now remained and developed. Projections for greater economic cooperation Apart from sentiment and prejudice, economic cooperation between Indonesia and China is expected to intensify. Based on data from the National Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM), China is the fourth largest contributor of foreign direct investment to Indonesia after Singapore, Japan and Malaysia. In the period January - December 2018, investors from China invested US $ 2.4 billion, or around 8.2 percent of the total foreign investment entering Indonesia. This number decreases when compared to Chinese investment in Indonesia throughout 2017, which is 3.4 billion US dollars, or 10.4 percent of total foreign investment. In the future, relations between China and Indonesia are predicted to strengthen further along with the 2030 Strategic Partnership Vision between China and Asean member countries. The pillar of cooperation that will be built in this vision between the Asean countries and China covers the fields of political and security cooperation, the economy and the socio-cultural fields. In the field of economic cooperation, for example, ASEAN countries and China agreed to intensify efforts to meet the joint target of trade volume of US $ 1 trillion and investment of US $ 150 billion by 2020 through deepening economic relations and increasing connectivity. And hope to increase the yield even more by 2030. With this vision, trade, investment and tourism flows in the ASEAN region with China are expected to increase rapidly. Head of BKPM Thomas Lembong was quoted as saying by Mietspiegelnews saying that investment from China must be handled properly in order to reach full potential in Indonesia. Lembong said most of the countries he knew wanted to work with China and continue to develop investments and make them increasingly controversial. He then compared China&#39;s investment with Japanese investment throughout the world in the 80s and 90s. &quot;Today, Japanese investment in the whole world is well received and is really not questionable.&quot; He believes that Indonesia is also moving in the same direction as investment from China. ae / hp (Mietspiegelnews, NZZ, China Daily, Asean.org, Tirto.id) googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); (nvc / nvc) with the 2019 election",17 Apr 2019,2019-04-17 08:09:00

Latent Issues Ahead of Voting,Masalah Laten Jelang Pencoblosan,https://news.detik.com/kolom/d-4512446/masalah-laten-jelang-pencoblosan,id,"Jakarta - The campaign period has finished. All strategies seem to have been used by each party. And now, ahead of tomorrow&#39;s April 17 voting, worries are raging. Because there are a number of crucial latent and dangerous situations that need the attention of all parties. Because it is not impossible that the situation can stick out at the last moment. First, the fragmentation of the two groups of presidential candidates who are increasingly hardened. More danger, both of them now carry nationalist and religious claims. In the last days of the campaign we witnessed each party showing support from a number of prominent religious leaders and scholars. We understand that at the elite level, each party deeply understands the political differences of the clerics. Moreover the scholars themselves, they must have seen this difference as mercy. But what develops later at the grassroots seems not linear. Religious claims actually appear on both sides. The support of the clerics was used as an excuse to chlorinate religious values in the presidential election this time. And this is obviously dangerous. googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); Because genealogically this claim has an extraordinary allure. Someone, or one group will be very militant in adhering to both. The binding capacity is no less powerful, both of them demand unlimited loyalty, life or death. Therefore, it is reasonable if the assumption arises that the two camps deliberately play this sensitive issue. The goal is nothing but to tie as much mass loyalty as possible. If this is the case, we certainly hope the two camps have a mitigation plan to neutralize the situation that is developing now. Do not let the militancy supporting the two camps increase to the extreme, to consider this democratic party as a war. Secondly, projections of victory that are over confidence. Towards the time of this election, we see that the two candidate candidates are so confident in their respective victories. Especially during the open campaign period yesterday, where the sea of humans was seen at almost every general meeting of the presidential and vice presidential candidates. Plus, the data that was considered valid entered the two candidates. Usually in the form of results of survey reports with a count of certain statistics. But don&#39;t forget, even in the world of political surveys, we know there is the term &quot;Bradley Effect&quot;. Where the survey results (especially internal ones) can be very misleading if they are used as a reference in ensuring election victory. This has been proven by Tom Bradley himself, a black man and former Mayor of Los Angles who ran for governor of the California region. According to the survey, he got an extraordinary victory. But when the election, it turned out he was badly defeated. This is because people (respondents) tend to hide their political preferences because they are worried about criticism and stereotypes for their choices. So they prefer good answers according to the public, not what they politically expect. In the case of presidential elections, it is not impossible that &quot;Bradley Effect&quot; can occur. As mentioned above, the tendency of candidates to attract loyalty to the extreme has made all citizens unable to stand in the middle. All were framed in the conflict map of the two camps. Not only political parties, but also independent institutions such as the KPU and Bawaslu are considered to be impartial and not neutral in this election. With such a group of suspicions, it would be difficult for anyone to find a definite calculation of people&#39;s political preferences. Therefore, do not let the projections of victory that over confidence become a claim of victory. Because this will be very dangerous. Third, and this is the most crucial of all. namely the issue of election fraud. It should be underlined here that in any competition, especially in elections like this, the issue of fraud can be said to be more dangerous than the issue of SARA. Because this issue can lead to delegitimation of election results, and at the end it can have an impact on the collapse of the rule of law and the state. Of the three crucial problems above, one and two can be considered as fundamental variables of conflict. Because these two issues cover the possibility of constructive e xchange of value between community groups (Johan Galtung, 2009). As a result, each party will suspect each other, and run extreme points. This is the latent situation we face now. The third is the most effective catalyst variable (trigger) to lift the latent hazard to the surface. The form can later be mass movements, riots, and even delegitimation of the election results. Especially for this fraud issue, election administrators and other authorities should not be careless at all. Because this issue is generally a hoax that has a fairly long narrative. All parties and authorities must be responsive to any issues of fraud that arise, however small, in any area. If found, the verification process on this issue must take place transparently, and the execution must also be precise and fulfill the principle of justice for all parties. In essence, do not give the slightest space for the birth of suspicion in the middle of this democratic party. We all hope that all the best happens in this election. Whatever the outcome will be, our main problem is cleaning up the scattered rubbish in the middle of the community. Because we don&#39;t want a democracy that we are proud of must die at the provocation altar.

Wiranto mentioned discussing with 1998 activists to prevent national riots.

Victims Hit Their Own Lust Running,Korban Tabrak Lari Hawa Nafsu Sendiri,https://news.detik.com/kolom/d-4507760/korban-tabrak-lari-hawa-nafsu-sendiri,id,"Jakarta - There is an ancient longing for a piece of Jalaluddin Rumi&#39;s poetry on humans. Rumi implies in one of his poems, &quot;These are all not human, only the human faces they have. Abdominal slaves, victims of lust.&quot; Let&#39;s reflect for a moment, just a moment. Have you been really good? How much benefit do you spread every day? Do each of us have the same desire: to live in harmony, peace, tranquility and prosperity? But, is that possible? Are there those of us who don&#39;t have hatred? Which political practitioners are not power hungry? If I may say, many people devote themselves to &quot;God&quot;, but not God who created humans, but God created by humans; through his lust, mind, reason, and will. God has provided facilities for sovereignty to humans - as khalifatullah (leaders on earth). Humans are not slaves to things, not slaves of lust, let alone political slaves. Humans are politicized to be servants of God, and to use them in fulfilling His will, spreading goodness and compassion. Not fists. Not a googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); The frills of life are not &quot;employers&quot; that we must obey. Sometimes we go forward, sometimes we retreat, and sometimes we are silent (stop in the middle). Life is dynamic, simple, does not have to be tired, sakmadyo (just enough and according to the function of benefit). You know, contradictions, violence, and the like are preceded by blind desire. The world becomes peaceful, chaotic, chaotic, and embarrassing. The tradition of hostility (conflict) in the human circle continues to spin, is inevitable, and we must accept it as a fact of life. In fact the conflict indicates closeness. It is impossible for supporters of one candidate to be in conflict with supporters of presidential candidates from other countries, different stalls. But we don&#39;t realize that if we are close, we finally think we are far, far away from everything. There are also many conflicts that cannot be considered reasonable, such as attacks on mosques in New Zealand, attacks on Charlie Hebdo Paris, Israeli military aggression against Palestinians, inter-tribal conflicts in Sigi, tribal war in Papua, conflict in Ambon, tribal war in Sampit, and finally the the most tragic is that the murder in Sampang was only because of the different choices of the presidential candidate. In the case of Indonesia now, the opposition is a reciprocal response. The one party agreed to continue - the performance was considered good, the other party refused - the performance was considered bad. So that the event fostered sharp friction among the elite and grassroots. The elite conflict took place openly, affecting directly the masses of their followers. When the elite argue, their followers fight fist because they have no opinion and different income. To overcome this, experts, observers suggested that there should be an open, broad and constructive dialogue so that people get healthy political education. It doesn&#39;t feel that easy. This phenomenon has been included in the circle of interests, it cannot just be broken off. Because each other is closed to each other and closes itself in the interests that must be achieved. Power Affairs If we ask questions to the elites about their political goals, it is none other than to prosper the people and give justice to the people. The goal is noble and not wrong; what is wrong is the path taken in realizing that power. In simple terms, there are two power affairs; before and after power. What must be a concern is to think after coming to power, meaning that as politicians who want to be in power, they are required to always explain the program, vision and mission, and views about the state. We don&#39;t see that, only the power ambitions are displayed. Ambition is indeed necessary, but not excessive, borrowing Rumi&#39;s language, &quot;being victims of lust.&quot; This problem is the beginning of a maze when politicians move ambiguous politics. On the one hand it promises to build, on the other hand destroy (with black campaign models). In political contestation it is natural, as done by Donald Trump and Bolsonaro. Rene Descartes said, I thought then I was, whereas politicians, I was ambiguous, so I was. Whether realized or not, the ambiguous attitude of politicians and their promises to contribute shares to the formation of a labyrinth of post-election power. But politicians like to argue, the promise of the campaign is one thing, governing is another thing. Similar to the satire of Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev, &quot;Politicians are all the same, they promise to build bridges, even though there is no river.&quot; Is it right if we say some of our politicians are victims of hit and run from their own desires? Imam Al-Ghazali asserted, &quot;A person who is drunk of power will be very sorry, very lost, when he is aware of his drunkenness: it turns out that his power is lost.&quot; This is what all candidates and supporters must prepare: loss. Determining Options In this life, making choices is the right of every human being, carried out without coercion, without pressure. But still, even though choice is our absolute right as a human being, results are not events that can be controlled. It arises because of input and is born because of the process; have two possibilities, which are expected and not expected. Then we must be prepared to accept both: victory and defeat. It should be feared, drunkenness will reject the fate of loss and become the entrance to the unrest (disintegration) of the nation because we have been blinded by our respective choices, so that we abandon our national values, which we uphold in Unity in Diversity. If I describe the entrance gate like this. First, &quot;dis-value&quot;. We lose the basic foundation, the values of goodness disappear, the values of unity are vanished - consequently we become human beings do not care about anything, social care is lost. Second, &quot;dis-order&quot;. Starting from the lost value, violations of the law become commonplace for us. Third, &quot;harmonization&quot;. The absence of obedience to the law, the possibility of harmony grows a little. Fourth, &quot;disorganization&quot;. The lack of harmony in the community has resulted in collapsing buildings together, and it can hit all joints - religion, ethnicity, race, culture, customs. Fifth, &quot;disintegration&quot;. Values are lost, disobedient to the law, not harmonious, unity wears off, the culmination of all &quot;destruction&quot;, conflict will continue to fill the public space. That is, the integrity of our nation is at stake. If it&#39;s like this, how? Offering a solution is not an easy job, at the end it remains normative as it has been before. At the end of this article I just want to say (not my intention to patronize), all of us who still have a sense of responsibility for the unity and integrity of this nation must consistently remind, exemplify, at least provide education on the ground that Indonesia must be built with noble values, dynamic value, and good values. May Indonesia remain a nation with a myriad of tastes.

The emergence of controversial issues about the mastermind behind the 1998 riots was increasingly bombastic when the discussion about the pocong oath took part. Initially, Kivlan accused Wiranto of taking Soeharto down. Kivlan said the evidence of his accusation was from Wiranto&#39;s attitude which suddenly left Jakarta when the situation was precarious. Wiranto was then Commander of the Armed Forces. He also accused Wiranto of being controlled by a group of generals to overthrow Suharto.

Bimbim continued, hoaks should not be allowed because Indonesia has always had a habit of silencing problems.

The BPN actually touched on the stronghold of 01 which has the potential to commit fraud through village funds to social assistance. &quot;Those who have the potential to commit fraud are actually not 02, why? Because the faction 02 is not in power, they have no instruments that are good enough to commit fraud, no instruments, where do they go from? What are the indications of cheating,&quot; said BPH Saleh Partaonan debate Daulay, when contacted, Tuesday (2/4/2019). &quot;It is usually the potential and able to abuse the authority of the government, because it has all the access to resources in the government, both the state apparatus network and the budget for social assistance in this fight,&quot; he continued. googletag.cmd.push (function () {googletag.display (&#39;div-gpt-ad-1547837152118-0&#39;);}); Also read: TKN Unveils Strong Maneuver 02 Build Framing Cheating for Delegitimizing Election Saleh explained, the BPN had no intention of maneuvering by framing election fraud. According to him, Prabowo-Sandiaga&#39;s timses were merely to remind the election organizers to be neutral, and ensure that this 5-year political contestation was honest and fair. &quot;Then the second, reminds the government not to use its power, and all those in its power to win the fight unfairly. Because there are indications that we see that many government programs are directed towards winning, social assistance, village funds, the salary increase, it all seems to be in order to lay down how the camp 01 won. That&#39;s what was reminded. So those two things are really reminded once, &quot;he explained. The issue of the 02 stronghold maneuver framing electoral fraud was expressed by the spokesman for TK Jokowi-Ma&#39;ruf, Ace Hasan Syadzily. This faction 01 has detailed that the &#39;framing&#39; weapons starting from the dissemination of apparatus slander is not neutral until the issue of 7 ballot papers has been broken up to the accusation that Habib Rizieq said several polling stations in Saudi Arabia were asked to win Jokowi-Ma&#39;ruf Amin. Also read: Amien Rais Calls for People Power, TKN: That Sense of Not Being Ready for Sale Saleh stressed, the BPN did not design a discourse on electoral fraud. He said, Timses 02 only reminded the election organizers and the government to ensure that the elections run honestly and fairly. Including Amien Rais&#39;s statement about the people power is interpreted as a warning. In order for the two camps to jointly oversee the course of the 2019 Election, it takes place according to the law without any fraud. &quot;So it is impossible for 02 to design a fraudulent discourse, then if it is linked they want to design the election to be rigged. In fact, what is conveyed now is a warning from all parties, KPU, Bawaslu and the government, so we certainly want then we want to make a riot, no, &quot;he explained. Previously, Ace explained that the Prabowo-Sandiaga camp was maneuvering to delegitimize the election results. There are several ways that the 02 faction has been accused of, including the attack by the Chairman of the PAN Honorary Council Amien Rais to the KPU. Read also: Amien Rais Calling the Lieutenant Presidential Election, BPN Prabowo Umbar Suspicion &quot;There is something interesting about the faction 02 maneuver lately, namely to build framing elections will be fraudulent. Framing this is part of a large scenario of delegitimizing election results. Even Amien Rais has threatened people power if they lose, &quot;said spokesman for the Jokowi-Ma&#39;ruf TKN, Ace Hasan Syadzily, told reporters on Tuesday (2/4). According to this Golkar politician, the maneuver was carried out by Prabowo because Jokowi&#39;s electability was far above. Amien Rais&#39;s threat was considered Ace as a scenario preparation for the efforts to be carried out by the faction 02.
