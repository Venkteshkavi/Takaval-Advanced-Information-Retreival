Grewal said when police could register an FIR against the developer and 8 other, then why can’t they arrest him.He alleged that developer enjoyed patronage of Congress MP Ravneet Bittu and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan and this is the reason why he attacked government employees.SAD district president Ranjit Dhillon along with former councillor Bhupinder Bhinda and a few other party workers also visited zone D to support MC employees. Congress councillor Parvinder Lapran also visited employees in the morning. Former cabinet minister Bikram Majithia also condemned the incident.Meanwhile, leaders of Youth Akali Dal (YAD) alleged that developer Gurnam Singh was affiliated to Congress and he is very close to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.The YAD leaders also highlighted a few past incidents where women employees had been attacked during the Congress regime in the past two years and claimed that neither women employees in the government nor other women in the state are safe under the Congress rule.The YAD leaders also staged a protest outside the temporary residence of developer in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar.

Shortly after a video of the beatings went viral on social media on Sunday, travellers from Bengaluru and Kerala demanded the suspension of the private bus operator's licence. Some narrated having faced a similar ordeal with the transporter's staff in the past.
Jacob Philip, an entrepreneur, was one of the passengers on the Kochi-Bengaluru bus. Midway through the journey, he narrated what happened in a Facebook post on Sunday morning.
Jacob said he boarded the bus at midnight at Haripad, Alappuzha district, and it broke down soon after. The Haripad police came to the spot after some time and found that the bus crew were being ""indifferent"" to the passengers and failed to promise them alternative travel arrangements.
The driver and the attendant then fled the scene. Police, too, expressed helplessness and left after 30 minutes. But the attendant was traced later and though his phone, Kallada was contacted. Passengers worried about their safety argued with the Kallada management. In the meantime, Kerala police officers reached the spot and convinced Kallada to arrange another bus by 3 am. The driver was brought to the spot and asked to proceed.
After an hour and a half of the journey, however, Kallada staffers waylaid the bus and started thrashing two young passengers who were vocal in their protest against the mismanagement. The situation turned ugly when the bus reached Vytala, Kochi, at 4.30 am. Over 10 goons dragged the two passengers out and beat them up. They did not allow other passengers to get off the bus. They let off the two youths after a lot of pleading. The bus finally reached Bengaluru at 4.30 pm instead of its scheduled arrival at noon.
Speaking to DH, Jacob said he was being threatened. ""I have been getting threats to delete the post. While I am going to Mumbai, 20 others were coming to Bengaluru,"" he added.
FIR registered
Following the incident, the Maradu police in the Kochi city registered a case of assault against three Kallada staffers.
According to the Maradu police, they had received information about the incident around 5.30 am and soon went to Vytilla, where they found the three youths who were assaulted. The youths said they were studying in Erode, Tamil Nadu.
No response from operator
Two of them were identified as Ajayagosh, from Thiruvananthapuram, and Mohammed, from Palakkad. Police asked them to go to a nearby hospital. But when the police reached the hospital later, they found the youths hadn't gone there. But since the footage of the incident had surfaced, police registered a case against three Kallada staffers. Further action would be taken soon, the station house officer of the Maradu police station said.
Police further said they tried contacting the tour operator's office in Kochi but there was no response. They later got in touch with Kallada through a travel operator at Haripad.",22 Apr 2019,2019-04-22 00:00:00,deccanherald

Chandigarh, April 26
The tussle over libraries once again rocked Panjab University (PU) today.
The BJP-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) put its foot down on the authorities’ decision to close off the reading room on the first floor of AC Joshi Library at 9 pm sharp. To control the situation from spiralling out of control, DSW (M) Emanuel Nahar, accompanied by Prashant Kumar Gautam, director, University Institute of Hotel and Tourism Management and PU chief security officer Ashwani Kaul, arrived at the spot and reopened the library at about 9.45pm.
The mode of conduct adopted by the varsity authorities was in utter contradiction with its day-old fiat by a team comprising Dean Student Welfare (M), Dean Student Welfare (W), library faculty and other professors, who, after much speculation and commotion, had agreed to open the reading hall of both, Guru Teg Bhadhur Bhawan and first floor hall of AC Joshi Library from 6 pm to 6 am.
Protesters claimed, when they visited the library at about 7pm, librarian Jivesh Bansal was heard telling students about the early closing of the reading room. “We reached there around 8 pm and the library staff was all set to pack up and leave. That’s when we all sat down at the threshold of the library to protest. Nevertheless, the librarian locked the gate at 9 pm and walked away,” said PU’s ABVP secretary Parwinder Singh Katora.
“That there was lack of security personnel and an in-charge who could run a graveyard shift at the library were justifications given to us by the librarian. When we volunteered to shoulder the task, Nahar sir arrived and the library was opened again,” shared PU’s ABVP President Kuldeep Singh.
He added, “Since October 9 last year, we have been submitting memorandums demanding that the library should be open to students for 24 hours. We also protested for four days at the VC office to get this reading hall opened. To our dismay, it was locked again, but we hope that now it will stay open.”
On Thursday, the PU’s team had opined that AC Joshi’s main reading hall has a capacity of more than 250 students which has occupancy rate of 80-90 per cent.
However, additional capacity can be generated in the main reading hall on need basis. Newspaper room can also be converted into a reading room after 5 pm with additional tables and chairs.",20 Apr 2019,2019-04-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

PATNA: A group of around 24 people led by a Congress leader from Saran district held a demonstration outside the state Congress headquarters Sadaquat Ashram here on Monday, demanding cancellation of candidature of actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha from Patna Sahib Lok Sabha constituency.Sinha, who won Patna Sahib seat twice in 2009 and 2014 as BJP candidate, joined the Congress a few weeks ago after meeting AICC president Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. He was later declared as Congress candidate from Patna Sahib where filing of nomination papers began on Monday.The demonstrators, who were holding placards in their hands, alleged that Shatrughan was “dropped through a parachute” at the RJD’s behest and has been made Congress candidate without consultation from the grassroots workers of the party. They alleged that senior Congress leaders “sold” the Patna Sahib seat to Shatrughan at the behest of RJD chief Lalu Prasad.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Rajesh Rathore said except one of the demonstrators, who is a Congress leader from Chhapra, the others were unknown people. “They were never seen at the Congress office. We believe they were sent by the rival BJP,” Rathore told TOI.He said Shatrughan’s candidature from Patna Sahib has been decided by none other than the Congress high command. “Once the party’s high command takes a decision, no devoted Congress worker goes against it,” he said.Earlier on Sunday, Shatrughan was heckled at the Congress state headquarters while he was addressing a meeting of party workers.The star-turned-politician annoyed a section of Congress workers across the country, including Bihar, when he visited Lucknow a few days ago and campaigned for his wife Poonam Sinha , who is contesting the Lucknow seat on a Samajwadi Party ticket.Shatrughan drew flaks from a section of Congress workers after he described BSP supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav as prime ministerial candidates in Lucknow.",04 May 2019,2019-05-04 14:24:53,timesofindia.indiatimes

Jalandhar, April 21
Members of the Bibi Bhani Complex Allottees (Pidit) Association and residents of Master Gurbanta Singh Enclave held a peaceful protest-cum-meeting against the Jalandhar Improvement Trust (JIT) here today on the Bibi Bhani Complex premises, demanding redressal of their grievances.
They accused the JIT of having failed to provide them basic amenities at the complex even after seven years.
The allottees of Bibi Bhani, who had taken the possession from the JIT in 2018 and 2017, alleged that they had been given possession of the flats fraudulently.
They said the JIT, at the time of giving the possession, assured that the water supply, proper roads and other facilities had been provided, however, the state of affairs of the site reflects a poor picture as there is no provision of water and sewerage till date.
Darshan Singh Ahuja, president of the Bibi Bhani Complex Allottees (Pidit) Association, said, “The protest-cum-meeting was held in order to find a solution to the complaints of the allottees, who had been living in such a miserable condition. Also, there are many allottees, who had neither received possession nor the refund,” he said.
He said those who had taken the possession belong to economically weaker section and were uneducated, and thus, got influenced by JIT officials, who without letting them make a visit to the complex, made them sign on the possession letters.
Ahuja added that there had been 25 families living in Bibi Bhani Complex while more than 50 allottees had not received the possession and had already filed their complaints against the trust with the consumer forum.
“In the meeting, we decided that all those already living there would also file a case against the JIT for deficiency in service in the consumer forum and would seek full refund of the amount they invested in the JIT flat scheme,” he added.
Residents of Master Gurbanta Singh Enclave also rued lack of basic amenities at their complex.
KL Arora, secretary, coordination, Gurbanta Singh Enclave, said, “JIT officials never stay true to their words. They had been fooling residents of Indrapuram for many years. There are a total of 888 flats in our area. The JIT had promised us separate entrance of 40-ft wide road, but just 11-ft road was given, which too is now blocked. We had been tired of complaining to the officials, but have received no response so far.”",20 Apr 2019,2019-04-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

The audio clip involved two men claiming to belong to an intermediate caste dominant in southern region discussing who the Mutharaiyar community would have voted in the recently concluded elections.
A. Velmurugan, one of the coordinators of the protest, said that the audio clip contained derogatory comments against the Mutharaiyar community particularly women.
C. Ilavarasan, one of the protesters from Ayyapatti village, alleged that though formal complaints had been filed a few days ago in Ponnamaravathi, the police were yet to act.
“In this age of technological advancement, why is it taking so much time for the police to identify and arrest the two men,” he asked.
The crowd, which included a small section of women from villages like Soorakudi, Ayyapatti, Chokkalingapuram and Pathinettangudi assembled in Singampunari near Melur.
Later, they carried out a procession for more than five km towards Tiruchi to Madurai National Highway.
While traffic on the highway was not allowed to be blocked, the traffic on the road going towards Singampunari was blocked for a few hours, police sources said.
Senior police officials rushed to the spot and held talks with the protesters.
On assurance that the police would nab the two men within a day, the protest was withdrawn.
“We have suspended the protest. If the police do not arrest the men, we will intensify the protests,” Mr. Velmurugan said.
The protest in Ponnamaravathi resulted in violence and led to imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Cr. PC.
It subsequently spread to some areas in Sivaganga and Madurai districts where Mutharayars have a dominant presence.",21 Apr 2019,2019-04-21 09:16:16,thehindu

Stones Thrown At Convoy of Congress Candidate From Tripura,Stones Thrown At Convoy of Congress Candidate From Tripura,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/general-election-2019-stones-thrown-at-convoy-of-congress-candidate-from-tripura-2025297,en,"Tripura's Congress candidate Pragya Dev Burman's convoy was attacked today near Tulashikhar village. The candidate, an erstwhile royal, was out campaigning for the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, when stones were thrown at her convoy. The area is part of the Tripura (East) constituency, where election was postponed in view of the security situation.
A supporter of the ruling IPFT has been arrested for the attack.
Polling for Tripura (East) – one of the two Lok Sabha seats in the tiny hill state -- was expected to be held today. But on Tuesday, the Election commission pushed back the election to April 23.
During the April 11 polls in the Tripura (West) constituency, there was widespread voter intimidation and rigging.
The election officials have taken note of the complaints by Congress candidate Subhal Bhowmick, who alleged booth capture by the BJP in Mohanpur, Bishalgarh, Boxanagar, Dhanpur and many other constituencies.
""I have travelled to different districts and saw videos where activities, which were against the rules of Election Commission of India, were seen,"" Tripura Chief Electoral Officer Sriram Taranikanti had said.
Political tension has heightened in Tripura since the state voted BJP and its ally, the IPFT, to power last year after two decades of Left rule. The two parties won 44 of the 60 assembly seats, with the IPFT winning nine seats. The Left had captured 16 seats, and the Congress, none.
In the last Lok Sabha polls in 2014, the CPM had won both seats.
But the BJP and its ally appear out of sync now and have opted against joining hands for the Lok Sabha elections. Among the contentious issues was seat-sharing in the Tripura (East) region.
""We have been requesting the BJP leaders to allow us to contest from Tripura East since it is reserved for tribals,"" IPFT chief and Revenue minister Narendra Chandra Debbarma, was quoted as saying by news agency IANS. ""If the BJP does not do so, we would put up candidates in both the Lok Sabha seats,” he added.
Discussions over seat-sharing arrangements with Congress were similarly fruitless, leaving the IPFT to fight a multi-pronged battle for its seats.
The IPFT and the BJP also disagreed over the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill as the regional party felt the Centre was working against the interests of indigenous tribals.

BJP candidate from the constituency, Manoranjan Samantaray has alleged that BJD activists have ostracised his supporters and agents at several places of the Assembly segment after the conclusion of first phase elections.
In a video clip, one G Debendra, a supporter of Samantaray was seen narrating the ordeal how BJD workers have been threatening and ostracised him for campaigning for the BJP candidate.
“Neither we are being allowed to use village water, nor are we allowed to buy ration. No one is also communicating with us and the only reason for that is, we are supporting a different party other than BJD,” said complainant G Debendra.
Not only Debendra, but BJD activists have also resorted to threatening BJP agents and workers by forcibly collecting Rs 1000 from them as penalty for supporting the saffron party.
“At least six agents of our party in Govindpur village have been penalised with Rs 1000 while many others have been ostracised. I too was also attacked by BJD activists. We demand that something needs to be done to end this hooligansim right away,” said BJP candidate Manoranjan Samantaray.
Hitting back at the allegations, BJD leader Rabi Nanda said, “Barring a few, if most people of a village take sides with BJD , should the ruling party be blamed if they are ostracised during the election period?”

Violence broke out in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar town on Wednesday as angry mourners clashed with police during the funeral procession of the senior RSS functionary killed in Tuesday’s terror attack along with his PSO, prompting the Army to stage flag march in the area.
No one was injured in the clashes, officials said. Curfew remained imposed for the second day in the communally-sensitive district following the killing of senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary Chanderkant Sharma and constable Rajinder Kumar, even as police intensified searches to nab the assailant.

The group soon turned violent and pelted stones on police personnel deployed there. During the clash, police resorted to cane charge and teargas shelling to disperse the protesting mourners and brought the situation under control.
The slain RSS leader was cremated at Chowgan ground in a ceremony attended by Sangh leaders, including its J-K chief Suchet Singh, BJP state president Ravinder Raina and former deputy chief minister Dr Nirmal Singh. The mourners shouted slogans like ‘long live Chanderkant’.

“Since 2013 when the posts were advertised we have faced a lot of problems. A court stay was bought to these posts which we fought by hiring a lawyer. We come from humble backgrounds and had to pool money to hire a lawyer. Now recently court passed three directions to the department directing it to issue select list within 15 days, but there is no response by the department,” said Mudasir Ahmed, an aspirant from Srinagar.
“In these 6 years many of us have crossed the upper age bar. This is ending our chances of what could be our last hope of earning a stable livelihood,” he said.

Amritsar, April 15
The city police have booked Talvir Singh Gill, SAD in-charge of Amritsar South constituency, for allegedly assaulting and injuring a construction contractor, said to be a supporter of Congress MLA Inderbir Singh Bolaria, here on Sunday. Gill is also media advisor to former Punjab cabinet minister Bikram Singh Majitha.
Besides, five others have also been booked for the assault. Besides Gill, among others, who have been booked, are Ravi Sher Singh of Partap Nagar and Sandeep Singh, alias Sunny, of Baba Budha Ji Colony. A case under Sections 323, 324, 506, 148 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against them.
Complainant Amninder Singh, a resident of Pritam Nagar, located on 100-Futa Road said he, along with his cousin and a friend, were having dinner at a hotel at the old jail road on Saturday night when his friend Prince received a phone call from the accused. They called him outside the hotel where the accused allegedly hurled abuses “only because they are supporters of Inderbir Singh Bolaria”, Congress MLA from Amritsar South constituency. He said the accused attacked him with a baseball bat and sharp weapons.
Hearing their cries, security staff of the hotel reached there following which the accused fled away in their SUVs. The FIR further states that Talvir Singh Gill had in the past threatened him of dire consequences if he did not stop supporting and roaming with the Congress MLA. He also feared for his life and property from the accused.
When contacted, Talvir Singh Gill said the case was registered under political influence. He said, “Amninder is a criminal who has been threatening the SAD workers in the area. A criminal case was registered against him in March, but the police dithered about taking action against him. “
According to Gill, he went to meet a person when he came out and had a verbal duel on Saturday. “I tried to pacify those quarrelling. In fact, I saved him from others and took him inside a hotel room, but they painted the scenario in a different way,” he added.",20 Apr 2019,2019-04-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

Members of the BKU Sidhupur on Thursday staged a protest in front of the District Administrative Complex demanding that the government must issue a notification stating that farmers could start paddy cultivation from June 5 onwards. The protesters blocked the Circuit House road causing traffic snarls on the Bathinda-Mansa road.
Later, the protesters gheraoed the mini-secretariat and raised slogans against the state government and the district administration. As administration officials did not pay heed to the protesters, they blocked the road leading to the DC’s residence.
The protesters said the department was misleading the farmers over the depleting groundwater and keeping the paddy plantation date from June 20. They said as the policy was affecting the farmers, this would not be tolerated. They said the late planting of the paddy crop led to many problems as cold weather conditions led to a hike in the moisture content in the crop and farmers faced the problem of selling the crop at the grain market. Left with no option, they had to sell their crop at a low price to private players.
Jagjit Singh, president of the union, said, “In the previous season when paddy cultivation was started after June 20, farm produce with moisture content was lying unattended at grain markets across the state. After which members of different farmer unions had staged a string of protests and the government had assured us that from the next season, paddy cultivation would be started on June 5. But that promise was never materialised and farmers are again at the receiving end. There is a notification issued by the government.”
Jagjit Singh added, “Owing to the indifferent attitude of the state government, farmers are being looted every year as they are coerced to sell their crop produce at lower rates. If the government does not issue a notification to start paddy cultivation before June 5, we would be forced to intensify our stir in the coming days.” TNS",20 Apr 2019,2019-04-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

He, along with 200 other employees associated with the All India Jet Airways Staff and Officers Association, marched from the international airport here to Siroya Centre, the headquarters of Jet Airways, on Friday, demanding immediate payment of salary dues.
March pay dues
A security supervisor who has been with the company for 10 years said: “I have a two-year-old daughter and I have been saving up for her education. However, since I haven’t received my salary, I had to pay my monthly expenses from that fund.”
The ground staff have not received their salary for March.
Kiran Pawaskar, an NCP leader and vice-president of the employees’ association, marched along with the staff. Later in the evening, Pawaskar and a few ground staff members submitted a police complaint.
Another ground staffer who has worked with the airline for nine years, said: “For the past five years we have been listening to vague promises from the management. We haven’t got an increment for the past five years because the company had been making losses. We have been quite supportive towards the company and we do not want it to fall; however, we deserve clarity on the future of the company and our salary.”
A senior customer care executive at the airport said: “The management should see what their staff goes through at the airport when stranded passengers yell at them. We don’t blame the passengers, they have paid money to buy expensive tickets.” He recalled the fury of a female passenger who spent ₹2 lakh on a flight ticket to Amsterdam and was stranded when the flight got cancelled.
Call for patience
Rahul Taneja, Chief People Officer, Jet Airways, tried to pacify the employees, saying, “We know the times are tough, and it is difficult to handle things. But we request you to please be patient. As soon as we get interim funding from SBI, we will transfer the funds.”
But Taneja’s plea did not cut ice. “It is a question of survival. The pilots and engineers are skilled and can get a job in any airline, however, the ground staff, especially the senior ones, will find it difficult,” said Pawaskar.
“The management said that if SBI transfers even a small amount, it will pay the employees. However, no fund transfer has happened so far, hence we will lodge an FIR against Naresh Goyal, the promoter of Jet Airways, Vinay Dube, the airline’s CEO, and Rajnish Kumar, the chief of SBI.” he added.
Meanwhile, Jet pilots have decided to gather at the airline’s headquarters on April 15 to seek clarity. The pilot body , National Aviators Guild, late on Thursday night sent a message to all the 1,000 pilots associated with the body about the protest. The pilots have also decided to call for an open house on the same day.",12 Apr 2019,2019-04-12 22:05:22,thehindubusinessline

The police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the clashing groups. Further, they deployed additional force to restrain people from indulging in untoward incidents in the rural town of Gurajala. A group of YSRC activists, as per reports, attacked a woman, who did not exercise her franchise at Jullakallu in Piduguralla mandal of the same Assembly segment. TDP activists lodged a complaint with the police and later as a retaliatory measure, they also pelted stones on YSRC activists.
Both these groups clashed against each other again in the early hours of Friday. Damacherla Vasu, Damacherla Dhanunjay and Damacherla Nagarjuna of YSRC were injured in the incident. All the injured were taken to a private hospital.

Four persons were injured in the incident and were immediately shifted to hospital. Meanwhile, TDP and YSRC groups clashed at Irlapadu of Chilakaluripet Assembly constituency. The YSRC activists carried out an attack on TDP cadre on Thursday night and two persons sustained minor injuries and they lodged a complaint with the police.

Over 5 lakh Amri Karbis living in seven districts without ST recognition
HT Bureau
GUWAHATI, April 10:Several hundred students and youth of Amri Karbi community on Wednesday marched towards Raj Bhawan here seeking a separate Autonomous district “Amri Longri” comprising parts of Morigaon, Nagaon and Sonitpur districts of Assam under Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India.
“We are different from the Chinthong and the Ranghang Karbis. We want the government to create an autonomous district for preserving our royal heritage,” Amri Karbi National Council (AKNC) president Padum Ingti said in a memorandum submitted to Governor Jagdish Mukhi here.
Ingti said the Amri Karbis had a separate identity during the 18th century and they were ruled by their own tribal kings during the Ahom regime.
“We have a population of over 4 lakh in the state. Most of them are in Kamrup Metro and Rural districts,” he said. They also demanded inclusion of Amri Karbi Tribes in Schedule Tribes (ST-H) list of Assam.
The proposed Autonomous Council would be set up carving out areas from the seven districts of Assam – Kampur, Morigaoan, Golaghat, Sunitpur, Nagaon, Cachar and Dubri.
There are about five lakh members of this tribe who were denied ST status even after 70 years of independence of the country, while others such as the Chinthong and Ronghang had been included in this category.
Accusing the government of not taking care of them, the memorandum said, “We should not be clubbed with the Karbis of Karbi Anglong. We have a district identity. There should a separate Autonomous Council exclusively for the Amri Karbis. A development council cannot fulfill our requirements.”
The organisation also urged the Governor to stop the proposed Assam Rifles camp at Domora Pathar under Dimoria Tribal Block.
It also urged to stop Guwahati Municipal area expansion towards Dimoria Tribal Block and Rani Tribal Block and said it would threat the existence of the tribal belts and blocks in the Kamrup district.
The AKNC demanded constitutional protection to tribal belts and tribal block across the state.
The memorandum also demanded the government for granting ST (H) status to Amri Karbi community by implementing Article 342 in the Constitution of India.
The memorandum further demanded implement the resolutions resolved in the meeting between Assam government and six organisations of Amri Karbi Six presided over by WPT & BC minister.",11 Apr 2019,2019-04-11 10:33:16,thehillstimes.in

“Eyewitnesses suggested there were two militants who opened fire at the protected person and fled towards upper reaches of Samna Colony,” said Inspector General of Police (IGP), Jammu, M.K. Sinha.
A curfew was imposed in the Kistwar town and Doda, after demonstrations broke out in Kishtwar, Bhaderwah’s Seri Bazaar and Jammu. Internet services were also stopped as a precautionary measure.

SURAT: A flash rail roko agitation by daily commuters at the tracks on Navsari railway station resulted in 18 trains on both up and down lines of Mumbai-Ahmedabad route running late on Wednesday morning. The regular passengers were demanding old coaches to be fitted to train no 12929 Valsad -Dahod Intercity Express so as to accommodates more passengers.After four hours of melee, 10 trains coming from Mumbai including Shatabdi Express, Delux Train to Delhi, Gujarat Express among others, had to be stopped at different stations leading to almost four hours’ delay. Eight Mumbai-bound trains also ran 3-4 hours late. However, after the assurance by railway authorities to set things right and meet all the demands made by the commuters within a week’s time, the agitation was called off and normalcy was finally restored .According to a rail official at Navsari station the commuters stopped the Valsad-Dahod intercity which arrived at the station at 7.50 am and didn’t let it leave.

Nearly 300-400 passengers travel to work daily. However, for the past 15 days they have replaced those coaches with the new Rajdhani-type coaches that doesn’t have space for parcel seat. Therefore, not more than 105 people can travel in the coach,” he alleged. “Despite our repeated pleas, nobody was paying heed to our plight and so we were left with little option but to sit on a flash agitation. Large number of women too joined our protest .”Station director at Surat station, SN Yadav, had to rush to Navsari to pacify the crowd and assure them of adding the old type coaches which could accommodate more people.

The incidents added to rising tension in the districts ahead of the first phase of voting on April 11.
Gauranga Chatterjee, the CPI(M) candidate pitted against Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) outgoing MP and Union minister of state Babul Supriyo and former film star Moon Moon Sen of TMC at Asansol in West Burdwan district, was assaulted in the Barabani area while he was campaigning. Chatterjee, who is also the CPI (M) district committee secretary, was admitted in Asansol district hospital after he and his supporters were beaten up with bamboo sticks.
Within hours of this incident, Fuad Halim, a doctor and son of former West Bengal assembly speaker Hasim Abdul Halim was assaulted in the Falta area of Diamond Habour constituency in South 24 Parganas district where he is contesting against Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and outgoing MP, Abhisek Banerjee.
Halim and a local CPI(M) leader were taken to the district hospital for treatment. The incident took place on NH-117 while Halim was campaigning.
In both the constituencies, Marxists accused TMC of carrying out the attacks, a charge ruling party leaders denied immediately. South 24 Parganas superintendent of police Srihari Pandey said police will conduct a probe once a written complaint is received.
In Asansol, former CPI(M) MP Bangshagopal Choudhary said, “TMC supporters assaulted Chatterjee when he was getting into a car after addressing a meeting. TMC is trying to create panic.”
CPI (M) supporters staged an agitation outside the office of the Asansol police commissioner.
TMC refuted the allegation. “Why should we attack CPI (M)? The assault is a fallout of squabbles in their party,” alleged Bidhan Upadhaya, TMC MLA from Barabani.
Two BJP candidates earlier accused TMC of carrying out attacks on them. Last week, Nisith Pramanik, the BJP candidate from Cooch Behar, which goes to the polls in the first phase on April 11, alleged that he was beaten up.
Bharati Ghosh, the former IPS officer contesting from Ghatal, alleged that her car was stoned at Daspur in West Midnapore district.
Incidentally, this is not the first time Gauranga Chatterjee, a former MLA, has been roughed up. He was allegedly beaten up TMC members inside the Bengal assembly in December 2012. His party colleague Deblina Hembram, who is contesting from Jhargram in West Midnapore district this year, was also beaten up on that day.
More political clashes were reported on Tuesday. At Jamuria in Asansol constituency, BJP and TMC workers clashed during a roadshow of Supriyo where his controversial election jingle was being allegedly played despite a ban by Election Commission.
Three BJP and three TMC supporters were injured in a clash at Bhejina village in Birbhum district.

BENGALURU: Residents of Munnekolala near Marathahalli on Sunday descended near the railway line, which cuts through their locality, demanding the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) put in place a better garage disposal system.The protest site was chosen by residents to highlight all that ails the solid waste management system in their locality; the area around the railway line has become an illegal dump yard. On Sunday, too, people kept coming in bikes and cars to dump garbage near the railway line, even as the demonstration was under way.""It was shocking to see people carry bags of garbage on two-wheelers and cars and throw them here. When questioned, some of them complained of lack of garbage disposal facilities,""said Prem Nath, a resident of Munnekolala.The protest was preceded by a vigil residents kept at the site for three consecutive nights, during which they found that people from restaurants, hotels and other food joints dumped garbage on the tracks.Residents said the biggest problem was absence of garbage collection in the area. Shamir, a resident, said BBMP does not send its vehicles to lift garbage from doorsteps and other establishments, forcing people to store it indoors. ""The concept of door-to-door garbage collection is missing and we have no choice but to throw garbage outside,"" he added.The problem is acute on 6th and 7th Cross of Munnekolala, where residents have begun throwing garbage in open areas. ""Lack of a proper disposal system is forcing me to throw garbage in open areas. If I don't do so, garbage piles up inside my house and it starts stinking,"" said Preethi K, a resident of Munnekolala. The residents have now formed a group - Protest against Garbage - to lobby for a solution to the menace.On March 24, they had staged a similar protest at the railway line. The BBMP promptly cleaned up the area, but soon garbage was back on the tracks. ""We want the BBMP to come with up a permanent solution and also ensure door-to-door collection,"" said Sunand K, another resident.BBMP's AEE (SWM) Mamatha MS said they have initiated action against illegal garbage dumping and have also been asking the local health officer to check the place frequently.

NAVI MUMBAI: Enraged residents of New Panvel gathered near the Cidco water tank premises, Sector 3 demanding regular water supply in the node.Erratic water supply after the festival of Holi has added to their woes and this they claimed is an unending issue.This was the fourth such protest by the residents in the past six months after Cidco failed to give any satisfactory response about the issue.Cidco officials said that the supply was disrupted as Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) took up repair work in its pipeline early this week. Owing to this, they claimed that the water pressure was slowly building up in the tail-end areas and that it may take a day or two for the supply to get streamlined.The neighbouring Kalamboli and Karanjade nodes, too, have been facing water crisis. The dilapidated MJP pipeline has been the major reason of erratic supply in Cidco-developed nodes.Protesters demanded immediate restoration of supply in some areas, which are bearing the non-supply slots for the past few days. They have threatened to come back in larger numbers to put pressure on authorities for their fundamental rights of getting a basic amenity like water.G J Dalal, Cidco executive engineer, water supply, said, “The problem started from Holi when MJP enforced a shutdown to repair the ruptured pipeline coming from Patalganga. It was followed by the Tata Power weekly off on Sunday when it does not release the river water leading to no supply of water. In this case it takes two to three days for the pressure to build up in the empty pipeline for full supply. Most of the areas have started getting good supply and remaining parts will get their quota soon.”Apoorva Prabhu, who led the delegation, said, “We have been facing water scarcity from last September and more severely in the past 20 days. Cidco has been giving the same explanations every time we protest and passes the buck to other agencies. We are asking for at least two hours of supply daily.”“We are working on some modalities as the MJP supply line is over three decades old. We are in the process of repairing the storage tank in Sector 3,” said Rahul Sarode, Cidco deputy engineer.Surendra Dashore, MJP sub-divisional engineer said that the damaged pipelines are being replaced part by part.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 09:27:22,timesofindia.indiatimes

AHMEDABAD: Heated arguments during a political debate organized by a news channel took an ugly turn when members of the ruling BJP and the main opposition Congress started scuffling and exchanging unparliamentary words. The programme was being shot on the Sabarmati riverfront near Paldi, on Sunday evening.Among those present were BJP’s Ahmedabad West MP Kirit Solanki; former Rajya Sabha member of the Congress, Raju Parmar; and the president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, Gujarat, Rutvij Patel.At one stage during the debate, slogans began to be shouted against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. “The workers of both parties suddenly started a scuffle,” said a police official. “The two senior leaders, Solanki and Parmar, also approached each other aggressively. Patel was rescued by police when he was mobbed by Congress members.”Cops then controlled the situation.

They had asked women members to lodge a complaint of assault and molestation.Police sub-inspector V H Thakor, in charge of the police station, confirmed the incident and said that two FIRs will be lodged.“Since the members of the two parties sat together, it was hard to ascertain who provoked the fight,” said an official of the Sabarmati Riverfront (West) police station.

AMBALA: Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) chairman Manbir Singh Badhana and Ambala deputy commissioner (DC) Sharandeep Kaur Brar have confirmed that there would be no restrictions on initiated Sikh candidates carrying Kakaars into the examination halls for state civil services preliminary examination scheduled to be held on Sunday.However, the officials said, the aspirants would have to follow the due procedure of frisking as per the rules.On Friday evening, some media organisations and Sikh groups on Facebook had started sharing the misleading information after attaching the copy of announcement dated March 26, 2019, released on HPSC website mentioning in its point number 2 that 'any religious signs etc.' should not be carried into the examination centre by the candidates.On Friday, a prominent media organisation in the region posted a news on Facebook mentioning that Kakaars have been banned in HPSC examination. The post also shared an audio clip of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal terming the HPSC decision as incorrect and assuring to highlight and discuss the same with Haryana government on Saturday.The officials of the HPSC told that some Sikh religious organisations, and student bodies mistakenly linked the ‘religious signs’ mentioned in the announcement to the five-Kakaars carried by the initiated Sikhs (Baptised Sikh).As per the officials, the ‘religious signs’ refer to some of the religious signs like Om, Khanda, Cross, religious lockets, etc. which are often worn by people in the form of jewellry.“As per the standard practice in the entire country, we cannot allow any such item into the examination hall which could be used as a weapon. Even bangles or Kara are not allowed into the examination hall due to certain issues related to breach of fair conduction of exam, as there are several high-tech technologies available in the market which could be used for cheating. We have appealed the candidates through announcements on our website that they must not wear any such items. But in the cases of faith and religious sentiments, on March 30, we have issued another announcement on the website that candidates wearing objects of faith are allowed to enter in the examination centres only after proper checking/frisking and scanning to ensure no cheating material (in physical form or in electronic form) is attached inside the object.”Ambala DC Brar also confirmed that initiated Sikh candidates are allowed but they have to undergo the due procedure of checking as per rules. DC said, “It is misleading that the Sikhs wearing Kakaars are not allowed to sit in HPSC examination on Sunday.”A bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court directed the state government and HPSC secretary to upload the directions on its website that such baptized Sikh candidates, who intend to keep kara and kirpan during the examination, should reach their centres one hour before the reporting time and allow the authorities to screen their belongings.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 03:37:27,timesofindia.indiatimes

Members, Kiranjot Kaur and Balwinder Singh Bains, raised questions regarding the fund allocation but their voices were suppressed during the proceedings.
Questioning the 85% increase in the fund allocated for the travel expenditures of SGPC members, Kaur said, “In the last financial year only ₹10 lakh was allocated for the same though the actual expenditure came out to be ₹70 lakh. How is this possible, when the members’ expenditure was less than ₹1 lakh as per records? This year ₹85 lakh have been allocated for travelling.”
To drive her point home, she quoted another SGPC member Tota Singh, who while addressing the session had said most SGPC members did not use the fund allocated for travelling and bore the expenses as they were the ‘sewadars’ of the Sangat. Tota Singh’s statement was endorsed by many members. However, Kaur was interrupted and not allowed to speak further.
Addressing the media after the session, she said there were many other lapses in the budget and the Sikh Gurdwara Act (1925) had been violated on many counts. She also questioned the ₹1 crore that was given to a polytechnic college in Fatehgarh, though the expenditure was not approved.
Another member, Balwinder Singh Bains was also not allowed to speak. He was trying to take up the cause of the 523 expelled employees, who are staging an indefinite sit-in outside the SGPC head office.
Tota Singh, who had been a Punjab minister in the SAD-BJP regime, said members of the opposition should also be heard because the gurdwaras were not anybody’s private property.
SGPC general secretary, Gurbachan Singh Karmuwala, delivered the budget speech. For the second consecutive year, the SGPC has earmarked a sizeable amount (₹12.63 crore) for the celebrations of the 550th Parkash Gurpurb of Guru Nanak Dev. This years allocation was only ₹4 crore short of last year’s allocation.
The funds allocated for propagating Sikhism were increased from ₹76 crore to ₹84 crore, while ₹14 crore were earmarked to aid the underprivileged Sikh sections in other states and ₹2 crore were alloted for dharma faujis. A section of the budget was also reserved for aiding victims of natural calamities.
A total of ₹37 crore were allocated for education and ₹8 crore were set aside for Sikh missions being run by the SGPC across the world. A ₹1.6 crore fund was created to compensate victims of the 1984 Sikh massacre and Jodhpur detainees. ₹16.5 crore were set aside to aid needy Sikh students at the Guru Granth Sahib World University and Miri Piri Medical College Shahbad Markanda.
BOX: Executive member shouts slogans against SGPC chief
A few minutes before the budget session, an executive member of the SGPC Baba Gurmeet Singh Tilokewala and Harpal Singh shouted slogans against SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal and other office bearers, including senior vice president Raghujit Singh Virk for not taking the grievances of expelled employees seriously.
Enraged over not being heard by the SGPC office bearers, he called the gurdwara body a bunch of thugs and thieves. He also used the same adjectives for the SGPC president. Joining the indefinite sit-in outside the SGPC office, he said the SGPC was being unjust to the employees.
He too was not allowed to raise the employees concerns during the session. Another member, Harpal Singh, also joined the sit-in. Activists of the Bhai Baldev Singh Wadala-led Sikh body ‘Sikh Sadhbhawna Dal’ also held demonstrations outside the hall.

Shashi Tharoor’s “squeamish” tweet kicks off controversy,Shashi Tharoor’s “squeamish” tweet kicks off controversy,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/shashi-tharoors-squeamish-tweet-kicks-of-controversy/article26686693.ece,en,"Congress MP Shashi Tharoor found himself on a sticky wicket on Saturday as his tweet following a visit to the fish market here kicked up a row, with the ruling CPI(M) and BJP alleging he had insulted the fishermen community and demanded an apology.
The former Union minister, who is trying to score a hat-trick from the prestigious Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency, had visited a fish market in the state capital recently and spoken to the women selling fish there and had also posted some pictures of his visit.
“Found a lot of enthusiasm at the fish market, even for a squeamish, vegetarian MP,” Tharoor had later tweeted.
As controversy erupted over the use of the word “squeamish”, Tharoor in another tweet quoted the meaning of the word from an online English-Malayalam dictionary “For those Malayali leftist politicians who are currently having difficulty understanding my English“!
For those Malayali leftist politicians who are currently having difficulty understanding my English! pic.twitter.com/vhOi7hThgo — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) March 29, 2019
In another tweet, Tharoor wrote “order delivered” and put its word by word Malayalam translation as “Kalapana prasavichu” (Kalapana has given birth)” to pinpoint the pitfalls in translations.
The CPI(M) and BJP attacked the Congress MP, saying he had insulted the fishing community by his choice of words.
BJP candidate Kummanam Rajasekharan said Tharoor should apologise and said his act of “humiliating” the fishermen community through the social media was “extremely deplorable.”
He had insulted the fishermen community who had saved several lives during the devastating floods in August last year, the former Mizoram Governor said.
Protest marches
Fishermen have taken out marches in Kochi, Kollam and Kozhikode protesting the tweet, saying they had been insulted.
During the August floods last year, it was the fisherfolk who had saved thousands of life, they said and demanded an apology from the two-time sitting MP.
When reporters sought his reaction, a visibly upset Tharoor, said he was busy with campaign work and did not wish to comment.
Tharoor had in February this year recommended Kerala fishermen, whose deeds of courage were the main highlight of the rescue operations during the 2018 Kerala floods, for the Nobel Peace prize.
“It was during the height of this tragedy that fishermen groups of Kerala, at great risk to their lives and potential damage to the boats that are the source of their livelihood, jumped into the fray to save their fellow citizens,” Tharoor had written to the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel committee.",30 Mar 2019,2019-03-30 16:01:50,thehindubusinessline

By Iffath FathimaAbout 100 came together to draw authorities’ attention to their plightTired of repeated pleas to local authorities like panchayat and MLA going unheard, residents of Rayasandra, which is situated 5 km from, staged a protest on Saturday asking for better roads, power supply and water facilities.From children to adults, about 100 residents gathered and expressed their protest. “This has been a problem for the past two years. The 1-km road is in a pathetic condition. It is 6-foot wide, but dug up on both the sides so we can only use a narrow part in the centre of the road. At times, they start up the patch work and leave it unfinished,” said a member of Mahaveer Orchid Owners Association ().Residents of Mahaveer Orchid disclosed that the roads had been dug for laying of UGD lines, but work isn’t completed.Lokesh Padil, Secretary of MOOA, said, “We face a garbage disposal issue too. Since our locality doesn’t come under BBMP, nobody comes to collect garbage. Our association has assigned vendors to pick up garbage and dispose it of. But other residents dump it on a vacant land nearby. It’s a problem to go out of the house and the place starts stinking.”This apart, residents said there were frequent power cuts in the society. “Every day, the power goes off for about 2 hours. There are days when power goes off for more than 6-8 hours,” said a member of MOOA.They said they have been facing scarcity of water too.",31 Mar 2019,2019-03-31 06:00:00,bangaloremirror.indiatimes

The ‘darshani deori’ of the gurdwara, founded by fifth Sikh master Guru Arjan Dev in the sixteenth century, was built during the Sikh Empire three centuries later.
Eyewitnesses said nearly 300 people armed with sharp-edged weapons, baseball bats, hammers and sticks started pulling down the structure built with Nanakshahi bricks at around 9pm allegedly at the behest of Baba Jagtar Singh, head of Kar Sewa’s Tarn Taran faction, who has been entrusted with carrying out ‘sewa’ (service) at the gurdwara.
Some local Sikhs and devotees tried to stop the activists who didn’t pay any heed to them continued with their demolition bid that continued for around two hours, they said. The gurdwara management or office-bearers of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex gurdwara body, failed to turn up at the spot to stop them, it was alleged. The SGPC denied having given permission to carry out demolition.
At around 11pm, a police team led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP city) Kawaljit Singh reached the spot to get the demolition stopped.
Tarn Taran SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “Since it is an internal issue between the SGPC and the Kar Sewa, we have not registered any case so far. An FIR will be lodged if we will get a complaint from the SGPC.”
Some local Sikh activists demanded a criminal case against those who demolished the structure besides arrest of Baba Jagtar Singh and threatened to launch a protest if their demands were not met.
Earlier, on September 14, 2018, the Kar Sewa activists attempted to pull down the ‘darshani deori with the SGPC nod but local Sikhs stopped the demolition bid.
Gurdwara manager Partap Singh said, “At 10:30 pm, I came to know that the activists were demolishing the structure. I immediately called up Baba Jagtar Singh to stop this. Since the SGPC had passed a resolution allowing Jagtar Singh to reconstruct’ the ‘darshani deori’ in July 2018, I didn’t lodge a police complaint.”
SGPC secretary Roop Singh said, “The apex gurdwara body has not taken any final decision on the ‘darshan deori’ as it was pending after objections from the Sikh sangat. It is a conspiracy to defame SGPC.”

IMPHAL: A constable suspended for his “links” with a fugitive militant chief died in police custody on Saturday evening.Manjur Ahmed (34), from Yairipok Ningthoumanai in Thoubal district, was posted at the Imphal East Police reserve line. He was suspended on March 12 on charges that he was associated with militant leader Thokchom Nando.The rebel chief led the banned Kangleipak Communist Party (Mangal/Nando) and had been in jail since 2003 on several charges, including kidnapping and murdering the eight-year-old daughter of former minister Francis Ngajokpa. Last Tuesday, Nando escaped from the heavily guarded security ward of Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences (JNIMS) in Imphal East, where he was undergoing treatment.“A day later, Ahmed was picked up by police. He died in custody on Saturday evening after being tortured during interrogation,” Ahmed’s brother Anwar Hussain said.The government has ordered a magisterial inquiry into his death. The district magistrate of Imphal East will conduct the inquiry into the circumstances leading to his death, a statement issued by the state home department said, setting a one-month deadline for submission of the report.Locals have set up a Joint Action Committee against Ahmed’s custodial death and made four demands — FIR against culprits, fitting punishment for them in 24 hours, CBI probe into the case and postmortem examination of Ahmed’s body within 24 hours in the presence of two members of the committee and the head of the JNIMS forensics department.If the government fails to meet these demands, the local pressure group has said, a mass meeting will be convened to discuss the next course of action.An Imphal court, meanwhile, reserving the conviction order in the murder case Nando has been accused of, has issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against him. Police have declared him a ‘wanted’ man and announced a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh for anyone who can provide information leading to his arrest.Ahmed’s is the third custodial death in Manipur in four months. In December, five policemen were suspended after an auto driver from Thoubal died in custody. In February, a villager at Keibul died in custody after being arrested by Keibul Police on charges of killing a wild boar. In both cases, locals said the detainees had been tortured to death.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 09:27:35,timesofindia.indiatimes

The deceased has been identified as Jaley Anna, a supporter of sitting MLA Tirong Aboh who is contesting the ensuing assembly elections from the Khonsa West seat as an NPP candidate.
Reportedly the miscreants also attacked another person namely Khamney Aboh who is at present admitted at the Assam Medical College and Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh, Assam and is believed to be in a critical condition.
A statement released from the state unit of NPP on Saturday said that a group of unidentified people entered the houses of Anna and Aboh in Kheti Village at around 9.30 pm and took the duo away with them to some distance far from the village.
“The miscreants thrashed them badly and later dropped them near the village at around 10.30 pm. The villagers took the duo to the district hospital, however, Anna succumbed to his injuries after some time,” NPP state vice president Nima Sangey Saling said in a statement.
Saling said that Anna mentioned the name of one Eli Ketok before his last breath. Ketok who also lives in Kheti village is allegedly a member of the NSCN (IM), a banned underground outfit. “Anna succumbed to the merciless beating by Eli Ketok of NSCN (IM) and his group. The condition of Aboh is also critical,” Saling said.
Following the incident, an FIR has been lodged at Khonsa Police Station by Chathien Anna, wife of late Anna and NPP district president Naklam Besai.
Tirap deputy commissioner P N Thungon and superintendent of police J Meena, when contacted, refused to comment on the matter saying “the case was under investigation”.
Strongly condemning the incident, the NPP has meanwhile, called upon all the political parties of the State to not get involved with any kind of underground elements during the electoral politics.
“We should try to gain the sympathy of the people through our hard work and connect with the ones at grass root level with a clear vision of development peace and harmony.

NEW DELHI: A fashion show in the engineering department of Jamia Millia Islamia was cancelled due to opposition from certain students of the department who called it “immoral” and “un-Islamic”. Now, many in Jamia have come out to oppose the “intolerant and radical elements”.Students alleged that the event was opposed by a 12-member ‘Students of Jamia’ group, an organisation known for its religious sermons and programmes on the campus in collaboration with vice-president of AAP’s students’ wing, CYSS. They said such incidents bring disrepute to the university.Sadaf Nasar, a tourism management master’s student, said, “Already Jamia has been stereotyped for its minority character. Incidents like these strengthen the stereotypes that Jamia is regressive and that students don’t follow any democratic ethos.”The fashion show ‘Tarz-e-Libas’ was to be part of the ‘Xtacy’ fest held on March 30. But before the event could start, a group of 12 men came and disrupted it holding placards that read: “Fashion shows are against the very idea of Jamia”.Mohammad Arshad Warsi, one of the protesters, claimed “Jamia has a certain ‘tehzeeb’ or culture and events like fashion shows are not part of it”.Aqdas Sami, a prominent student leader who is also the Delhi vice-president of AAP’s students’ wing CYSS, supported the protest. “Such events create disruption in the university and are not part of Jamia’s ethos,” he told TOI. He claimed the incident was being blown out of proportion but couldn’t explain why there were no protests in the past for other fashion shows on campus.CYSS Delhi general secretary Hariom Prabhakar said, “Our outfit is not against any fashion show but only against the objectification of women.”But the organisers had a different story to tell. “We were threatened by these students who acted like they were guardians of faith and of Jamia’s culture. The university has seen several such fashion events in the past but there was never any such protest. They wanted to make a political statement and created a scene at the venue,” said an organising team member on condition of anonymity.The student added, “The Jamia administration was backing us to go ahead with the event but we decided to cancel it due to security reasons.” Ahmed Azeem, the media coordinator of Jamia, said the university is looking into the incident.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 11:55:48,timesofindia.indiatimes
Farmers on warpath across state,Farmers on warpath across state,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-on-warpath-across-state/750287.html,,"With polls nearing, they want parties to commit to fulfilling their demands
Ruchika M Khanna
Tribune News Service
Chandigarh, March 29
Restive farmers in Punjab have launched agitations across the state, forcing all political parties in the fray for the May 19 General Election to sit up and take note.
Their agitation, launched just as the poll scene begins, is likely to force political parties — the ruling Congress, SAD-BJP, AAP and Punjab Democratic Alliance to commit to fulfilling some of their demands.
While the Opposition parties — both SAD- BJP and AAP — have been extending their support to the farmers, the latter are venting their ire against the ruling Congress, for most of their troubles, be it a complete loan waiver or farmers being forced to give blank cheques as security for loans. But they are equally blaming the Centre (BJP-led NDA government of which the Akali Dal is a constituent) for the rise in costs of all farm inputs, poor remuneration of crops and not implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission report.
“The agitations launched now are not in favour of or against any political party. We only want each party to commit that they will take up our cause if voted to power,” said Satnam Singh Pannu of Kisan Mazdor Sangharsh Committee. Beginning today, he is leading a “Jail Bharo Andolan”, wherein 51 farmers will court arrest everyday in Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Gurdaspur and Jalandhar. Other than this, seven other farmer organisations, led by the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), are protesting outside banks each day, demanding that the blank cheques taken from indebted farmers “illegally” be returned to them. These organisations will also be holding a protest from May 2 to 4 in Patiala (hometown of Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, from where his wife Preneet Kaur is seeking to contest the polls) against the inability of the state government to give a complete loan waiver to farmers.
Other than this, though the cane growers, who protested against the non-payment of their dues by the sugar mill at Dhuri for 20 days, have ended their stir, these farmers have stated that they will re-launch their agitation from April 2, in case their dues (as promised by the administration on March 26, when the dharna was lifted) are not cleared. Today, a case was registered against 100 of these protesting farmers for locking the SDM and other officers in their office, when the agitation was on earlier this week. This has led to widespread condemnation by almost all farmer organisations and they have extended their full support to the farmers against whom case is being registered.
“First, the government held back the dues for cane given by farmers to sugar mills. They protested for 20 days and no payment was released. Only when in desperation these farmers took an extreme action of locking officers, the government promised to release their dues. This means that the government had money, but were not willing to release it to us,” rued Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary of the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), adding that this time they would force each political party in fray to announce and commit to the promises made for farmers.

BENGALURU: Opposing the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation’s (BMRCL) decision to fix Rs 50 as minimum balance in smartcards, several Metro users on Friday staged a protest near Town Hall Most of the protesters were youngsters who had connected through social media and had no backing of any political party or NGO. They waved posters and shouted slogans against the new rule.The BMRCL on Wednesday increased minimum balance in smartcards to Rs 50 from the previous Rs 8.50.Slamming the BMRCL for taking autocratic decisions without consulting passengers, they demanded the management roll back the decision. “The BMRCL management has taken a unilateral decision by fixing a minimum balance of Rs 50. This will make it even more difficult for lower income people to use the Metro. If a passenger wants to travel short distance, why should he or she pay Rs 50 in advance,” asked Krushika AC, who led the campaign.“I was surprised when they implemented this new rule without even informing passengers in advance. It’s a big amount for daily wage workers, but they are aware that commuters do not have alternatives. In fact, the management was unwilling to listen to our problems,” he added.Muthuraj, another user, said: “They claim to be ‘Namma Metro’ but they do not seem to practise it. They want only affluent people to use the service. We don’t need Rs 50 in smartcards to travel in Metros like Delhi or Chennai, then why in Bengaluru?”“There is no rationale behind this decision. Why should someone keep Rs 50 when they already paid the same amount while purchasing a card? Will they further increase the minimum charge once they expands their network,” asked Guru Prasad DN also a commuter.In two hours, the group collected over 300 signatures from Sampige Road Metro station on a memorandum they plan to give to BMRCL. “We will intensify the protest if they don’t withdraw the decision,” they said.Namma Metro’s average daily ridership is around 4 lakh. Of this, about 62% (2.3 lakh) are smartcard users. The corporation made Rs 50 mandatory in smartcards after several users with low balance allegedly got into arguments with staff at exit gates, claiming they had no money to pay the excess fare. BMRCL officials say there are 10-12 such commuters a day, which, however, translates to a minuscule proportion of the total users.Sharanya GS, a regular passenger, said: “Those misusing the card should be made to surrender the card on exit if there is no balance or cash. Defaulters can later make the payment and reclaim the cards. Anyway, Metro authorities will have to refund Rs 50 when we surrender our cards.” Another passenger Sanjiv S said: “It’s unfair to punish majority of the passengers for the fault of a few fraudsters.”",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 09:26:38,timesofindia.indiatimes

“It has been three days since the incident and the police are yet to make any arrests. The film crew had taken neither permission for the shooting nor any precautionary measures. This led to the loss of two lives,” said Tabrez Khan, Sumera’s husband.
‘Negligence’
Munawwar Khan, a relative of the victims, said it was a case of clear negligence on part of the film crew, but so far, no one from the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce had offered any consolation to the family.
The protesters demanded that the police speed up the investigation and said they would continue to protest till arrests were made. However, senior police officers spoke to the protesters and convinced them to end the agitation. They assured them that the probe was on and that arrests would be made soon.
Meanwhile, Zainab, 8, who sustained multiple injuries in the accident, is recovering at a private hospital.
Ranam is being produced by Kanakapura Srinivas and stars Chiranjeevi Sarja and Chetan. The film crew was shooting a car explosion scene at the Bengaluru Aerospace Park SEZ, Bagalur, on the city’s outskirts on Friday evening. Mr. Tabrez, along with his family, was heading to Soolibele to a relative’s house in a car when he noticed the road blocked because of the shoot.
The family members got down to watch the action. Sumera, Ahera, and Zainab stood behind a film mobile van, parked near the spot where the car was set to explode. Multiple compressor cannons had been placed under an SUV. The cannons, when fired, were to propel the car into the air. However, when they were fired, one of the cannons — a 3.5-ft metallic cylinder — flew across the road with high velocity and hit the bystanders, killing Ahera and Sumera. Residents of a nearby village claimed that members of the film unit, instead of attending to the victims, fled from the scene, abandoning everything in a matter of minutes. It was the villagers from Mahadeva Kodigehalli who helped shift the injured Zainab to a hospital.
Based on the complaint filed by Mr. Tabrez, the Bagalur police have registered an FIR against Shrinivas R., the producer, R.S. Production, director Samudram V., production manager Kiran, stunt manager Vijayan and his technical team, charging them under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and Section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and under various sections of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908.

The incident triggered a roadblock by BJP supporters in Harishchandrapur area of Malda district, about 405 km away from Kolkata.
According to the complaint filed with the police, Patanu Mondal (28) was sleeping with his wife and eight-month-old daughter when a few men entered the house and opened fire.
“We have received a complaint of murder against two persons, but they are on the run. Central paramilitary personnel will conduct route march in the area to restore confidence among the locals before the election,” said a senior police officer of the Malda district.
Incidentally, Mondal became the third person to be killed in political clashes in West Bengal since the elections were announced on March 10. On March 12, a 28-year-old Congress worker was killed in Chopra of North Dinajpur district. On March 18, a 45-year-old Trinamool worker was hacked to death in Murshidabad district.
On Thursday morning, BJP supporters staged an agitation in the area and prevented the police from taking away Patanu Mondal’s body for autopsy.
The murder triggered a blame game.
“Mondal used to work as a civic police volunteer for Harishchandrapur police station. Earlier, Trinamool workers framed him in a false case and he lost his job. Thereafter, he became a BJP leader in the area and a couple of days ago he was instrumental in organising a rally in the area where more than 1,000 people gathered, unnerving the ruling party workers. Trinamool-backed goons have killed Mondal,” alleged Malda district BJP president Sanjit Mishra.
Mishra also said that in 2018, Patanu’s elder brother Utpal won a gram panchayat seat on a BJP ticket in the Doulatnagar gram panchayat (where the family lives).
“Since that victory last year, the family has been facing pressure from local Trinamool leaders. After Utpal’s victory, Trinamool workers set fire to his (Utpal’s) house and damaged the jute that he cultivated. Ruling party workers were also putting pressure on Patanu to join the Trinamool,” added Mishra.
Dismissing the BJP leader’s claim, the working president of Trinamool’s Malda district, Dulal Sarkar, said, “The brother of the victim, Utpal, has already joined the Trinamool, and has been appointed the pradhan of local gram panchayat. Inspired by the development spree of the state government, Patanu, too, was also planning to join the Trinamool. BJP-backed goons killed him because of this.”
Mishra said the assailants fired four rounds and a bullet pierced Mondal’s neck.
In her complaint, the victim’s wife, Ruma Das Mondal, alleged that she was woken up by the sound of gunfire and saw two persons exiting the room. She named Sumit Mondal, a resident of the village, as one of the two. But she could not recognise the other assailant.
“A few days ago, Sumit threatened my father that he would kill my husband,” alleged Ruma Das Mondal.

The Srikakulam IIIT is being run on the Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (IIIT-Nuzvid) campus.
On Wednesday morning, nearly 900 first year engineering students of the Srikakulam IIIT staged a dharna on the campus, stating that they had been suffering from illness due to consumption of the stale food that was being served on the campus. Nearly 550 of them are girl students, who hail from rural parts in the State.
On condition of anonymity, the students on Wednesday told The Hindu, “Nearly 200 students have been admitted to the dispensary on the campus with complaints of stomach ache and vomiting in the past two weeks. The quality of food must be thoroughly inspected by the authorities.”
The students on Wednesday skipped breakfast demanding that food supplier be changed and quality food must be ensured to prevent health complications.
Vice-Chancellor, RJUKT-Andhra Pradesh V. Ramachandra Raju and Srikakulam IIIT Director S. Hara Sreeramulu held talks with the students.
The Vice-Chancellor has sought nearly two more weeks to make all the arrangements, offering quality food and providing hygienic conditions.
Prof. Hara Sreeramulu told The Hindu that a decision has been taken to rope in the students in the mess management committee to maintain the quality of food and ensure hygienic conditions.
“The mess contract signed with a private party expired recently and the new contract will be signed,” he added.
The students withdrew their protest following the assurances given by the authorities.",27 Mar 2019,2019-03-27 23:08:04,thehindu

Teachers of Adarsh Government School, Manawan, in Moga district on Tuesday staged a protest against the state government and the institute management for failing to give them salaries for the past eight months.
It was earlier run by Baba Ishar Singh Group of Institutions but in September 2018, the state government handed it over to Shaheed Udham Singh Education and Welfare Society.
Deepak Sharma, a teacher working in the adarsh school while talking to The Tribune alleged, “The school management did not send the bills to the state government for the release of funds for salaries.”
The Shaheed Udham Singh Education and Welfare Society took over the affairs of the school on September 6, 2018. The society paid the salary for the month of September for 24 days. Since then, it has not paid a single penny to more than 40 teachers and other employees of the school. Besides, the teachers said the BIS Group of Institutions used to pay them a salary of Rs 18,000 per month, but the new managing society had decreased their salary to Rs 16,500 per month.
A protesting teacher said the attendance register of the school too had been recently taken away by the management. The matter was brought to the notice of the district administration, but no action has been taken.
The state government, through the Punjab Education Development Board, has been running 26 Adarsh Schools in the state through the public private partnership (PPP) mode for over 10 years.

Embarrassed over the pro-Pakistan slogans raised by Mohammad Akbar Lone, a candidate of National Conference (NC) from Baramulla parliamentary seat, the Congress on Tuesday said it had taken up the issue with the leadership of NC, its ally.
The Congress had come under fire from its opponents, particularly the BJP, after the NC leader’s “pro-Pakistan” utterances during an election rally in Kashmir on March 23. The youth wing of Congress had publicly demanded stern action against Lone.
“It is unacceptable for Congress that anyone, who held a constitutional position, raises pro-Pakistan slogans. We have taken up the matter with NC leadership and it is up to them to take action against Lone,” Ghulam Ahmed Mir, JKPCC president, said during a press conference.
He said it was not the first time that Lone had raised such controversial slogans. “BJP should also answer why Kavinder Gupta, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, who had constitutional authority, did not take suitable action when Lone raised such slogans on the floor of Assembly during the PDP-BJP government,” he said.",20 Mar 2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

Appealing the District Collector, the parents requested him to address the issue and also control the management.
The parents also requested the Board of Education to take action against the school management for fleecing the parents. “We will continue our hunger strike until the management rolled back its decision,” Ms. Renuka a parent said.

However, in a face-to-face interaction with the parents, the School Director Annie Cherian had rolled down the fee hike for this academic year on the condition that the fee would be hiked from the next academic year by 25 %.

A large number of people assembled on the main road and chanted slogans against the government for “misleading” them.
Carrying placards reading “we want Degree College”, hundreds of protestors blocked the road.
“We have been neglected by the successive governments on one or the other pretext,” Abdul Rashid, a protestor said, adding that in 2104, when preparations for assembly elections were on peak, the former CM, Omar Abdullah, who also represented the constituency, visited the area along with officials of higher education.
“During that visit, he assured us that a degree college would be established in our area on priority,” Rashid said. “However, when higher education department sanctioned fifty new degree colleges in Kashmir valley, we have been time and again ignored”.
All shops were shut in the area following the shutdown call given by the Auqaf Committe Watrehail.
Abdul Salam Mir, another resident, said that Watrehail is a far flung area and deserves a degree college “but unfortunately the authorities have so far failed to do so and have neglected our area”.
He added that despite tall claims by the successive regimes, nothing has been done in this regard, “therefore the people, especially the student community has been left in lurch”.
“This is sheer injustice with the people of Watrehail and adjacent areas,” another resident said while appealing the Governor led administration to look into the demand.
“We hope that justice will be done and the college will be established in the area,” he said.
“Our children are being forced to cover long distances to reach their colleges in Srinagar or Budgam as there is no degree college in our area at present,” an elderly resident said.

The men were hired by a private contractor engaged with the Municipal Committee, Rayya. The incident occurred around 10 am. Vijay Kumar entered the manhole of the main sewerage line on GT Road.
Due to poisonous gases in the sewer, he fell unconscious. Immediately, Mukesh Kumar entered the manhole to rescue him and also met with the same fate. The other workers raised alarm and people started gathering around.
After half an hour, residents took them out of the manhole and rushed them to the Civil Hospital. Doctors declared them brought dead at the hospital. Family members and relatives of the deceased staged a protest against the contractor and Municipal Committee at the Civil Hospital. They demanded registration of a case against the contractor.
Dalbir Singh Tong, leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, joined the demonstrators and demanded compensation for the family, job for the dependents and case against municipal officials and contractor.
In the late evening, the families of the deceased entered into a compromise with the contractor. The police filed proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC in the case. “We have filed the proceedings as per the complaint. The families of the victims don’t want any action against anyone,” said Amrik Singh, SHO, Beas.

MYSURU: Days after officials in the Mysore Development Authority (Muda) announced that it had managed to obtain the consent of most farmers in Ballahalli to develop a new layout in the area, a section of ryots unwilling to part with their farms have warned the civic agency of launching an indefinite protest if it goes ahead with the land acquisition process. The farmers further threatened to prevent entry of politicians to their village if the acquisition process is not stopped immediately. Residents of the village said that they were contemplating boycotting the upcoming Lok Sabha elections to protest the ham-handed way in which Muda was going about with the land acquisition process.Members of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) and Hasiru Sene on Sunday said that they would launch a stir from Tuesday in front of the Muda office if the government did not drop the project. KRRS general secretary Guruprasad charged Muda with trying to forcibly acquire fertile and arable land in and around Ballahalli. “The land that Muda has acquired in Ramana Hundi, Birihundi, Salundi, Gouhalli, Komrabeedu, Badagalahundi, Marakyatanahalli and surrounding areas is very fertile. The land is being acquired by bringing in amendments to the land acquisition law,” Guruprasad said.He said that they would launch the protest rally from the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the Mysuru Law Courts complex, and terminate it at the Muda office. “Muda officials are obtaining signatures from innocent farmers of the village by coercion. The farmers are being misled,” Guruprasad added.Fuming at the silence of the elected representatives, Guruprasad said that the farmers had no one to approach with their woes. “This is the reason we have decided to ban entry of the politicians into the village seeking votes for the Lok Sabha election. If they are not willing to listen to us, why should we cast our votes?” he asked.The KRRS general secretary alleged that those who had agreed to part with their land were those who had illegally acquired it by means of encroachment.

He played a key role in the party after Jaleel Khan left in Vijayawada West and was angling for the seat.YSRC has given the ticket to former legislator Vellampalli Srinivas, factoring in various caste equations. Vellampalli Srinivas, who fought 2014 elections on a BJP ticket, had lost to Jaleel Khan.“Jagan had promised me that he will give Vijayawada West ticket to Muslim candidates. He has not kept his word. Giving the seat to Vellampalli, who is closely associated with RSS, would not work. Vellampalli has changed four parties in five years.

They said that the school management had asked them to come on Saturday morning, promising to issue enrolments numbers and transfer certificates to their wards. But the president of the school management, Praveen Sardana, didn’t turn up and instead sent his two relatives to the school.
The parents, who had come with their wards, got angry. They allegedly damaged windowpanes of a room and thrashed one of the relatives of the president.
After getting information about the incident, DSP Subhash Chand reached the school. Later, the angry parents went to the other branch of the school situated in the Workshop area of Yamunanagar. They raised slogans against the school management alleging it has spoilt the future of their wards.
“The management of every school has to apply to the CBSE for enrolment numbers which are issued in Class IX. Students can’t appear in the final examinations of Class X without the enrolment numbers,” said a parent.
Girish Sardana, brother of the president of the school management, said that they had enrolment numbers of most of the students out of the total 40 this time. The enrolment numbers of the remaining students would also be made available soon.

Nearly 100 AGP workers gathered at the party office at Old Circuit House Road here around noon and held a meeting and decided to protest the decision to renew the alliance with the BJP. Around 2pm, they vandalised the party office and burnt posters of Bora, Mahanta and Choudhury in protest. The Jorhat district president and secretaries of the AGP were not present.
Police personnel kept a watch on the situation but did not intervene. No complaint was lodged in connection with the incident.
Some Jorhat office-bearers of the AGP condemned the “unilateral” decision by the leadership to renew the alliance for the Lok Sabha polls, which they felt would harm the image of the regional party.
Niren Sharma, executive member of the AGP’s central committee, said the move would send a wrong signal to the electorate who were vesting their faith in the party to protect the identity of the indigenous people of Assam against the BJP’s “overt ploy” to give citizenship to illegal Hindu Bangladeshis and others through the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019.
Another member, Raja Chakravarti, said the leaders were allegedly only interested in power and money and for them the means justified the end. “After withdrawing support from the BJP-led government in the state over the bill, which was being opposed by one and all except the BJP, this U-turn will hurt the credibility of the AGP and its prospects,” he said.
The AGP had snapped ties with the BJP in January over the latter’s firm stand to push the bill in Parliament.
Though the BJP could not pass the bill in Parliament in the budget session, its national president Amit Shah had publicly said it would push the bill if it retains power after the Lok Sabha elections, something which has not gone down well with the anti-bill brigade.
Former chief minister and AGP legislator Prafulla Kumar Mahanta had on Thursday also opposed the revival of the alliance and decided not to campaign for the party in protest. Several AGP leaders have also resigned in protest.
AGP president Atul Bora, however, defended the decision to join hands with the BJP. “We have come together to defeat the Congress and other parties. The BJP has a national agenda while we have our own position on the bill. We will solve the issue through consultations and consensus.”",15 Mar 2019,2019-03-15 18:05:12,telegraphindia

They were suspended on Friday for demonstrating against the quality of food in the hostel mess, The Tribune reported.
A committee constituted of the administrative officer and other faculty took the decision to suspend six students and evict them from the hostel, Bar and Bench reported. The suspension order was passed without a formal hearing and in the absence of Vice Chancellor Paramjit Jaswal. The faculty also reportedly confiscated a mobile phone belonging to one of the suspended students.
The protests against the suspensions commenced at 8 pm on Friday evening. “Upon insisting that fundamental right of privacy are being violated, the faculty shamelessly and unreasonably responded with abuses and stated that the students are in no position to teach them the law,” a statement by the protesting students said.
“All the allegations being levelled by students are false,” National Law University Registrar Naresh Kumar said. “Students were suspended for their indiscipline. They were protesting against the suspension, which was done on the recommendation of the committee.” However, he added that the university was considering revoking the suspensions.
Though the protests against the suspensions comprised candle light vigils, a Rapid Action Force was deputed on campus, Bar and Bench reported. Mid-term examinations are scheduled to begin on Monday, and the suspended students have been permitted to take them. However, they must arrive on campus only 10 minutes prior to the exams, and leave within 15 minutes after they are over.
The protestors also sent an application to University Chancellor Krishna Murari, highlighting problems such as unreasonable library timings, restrictions on the mobility of women and their in-timings, incompetent faculty and indifference to sexual harassment complaints.
Murari was scheduled to meet the students on Saturday, but did not do so. Instead, Justice Mahesh Grover, the third senior-most judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, met the protestors. He is a member of the college’s general council.
“Day 3: This is the third straight day into the protest and our demands haven’t been met,” a student of the college tweeted on Sunday. “The authorities aren’t offering any kind of help. None of them [have] even come to talk to us.”

KOLKATA: A 28-year-old Kashmiri shawl trader, a regular visitor to the city for the past seven years, was stabbed multiple times and allegedly looted of cash worth Rs 1.95 lakh under Lohapool in Park Circus on Friday evening. Shakur Ahmed Shah has received 15 stitches, three on his stomach and another 12 near his thighs, and has cut marks all across his shoulders. He claimed he was on his way to deposit the money with a money lender.The GRP, which is probing the case, insisted it was not a “hate crime” and that the “robber”angle was being investigated. “There is absolutely no hate angle involved. We are still investigating certain facts provided to us by the victim,” said Asesh Biswas, superintendent of Railway Police (Sealdah).Late at night, the GRP detained one person.Alarmed at the attack on a Kashmiri trader, the state police top brass, too, is determined to get to the bottom of the crime. “We are working closely in association with Kolkata Police and going through CCTV footage to identify the accused. We are also taking help of the detective department to check out criminals active in the area. If required, the DGP has asked us to seek the help of CID,” a top official said. “The attack here was to snatch money and comparing this incident with the earlier attacks on Kashmiris in Behala and in Nadia’s Taherpur would be wrong,” the official said.In his complaint, Shah said he had boarded a local train from Jadavpur station (he has a rented accommodation in Survey Park) and got off at Park Circus. “I was carrying the money in a shoulder bag. The amount was the monthly payment to the money lender. I had started walking towards Lohapool and had just crossed the second railway track a little after 6 pm when someone called me from behind and asked me in Bengali: ‘Apni ki Kashmiri (Are you a Kashmiri)?’ When I replied in the affirmative, he attacked me from behind. Three others pounced on me and started stabbing and punching me. Then they snatched my bag and fled,” Shah said.The shawl trader said that he lay in the spot writhing in pain till someone came up to him and offered water. He then called up two friends who came and took me to Calcutta National Medical College hospital. “This is the first time I faced such hostility in the city. I am nervous. But the police have been of great help,” he told TOI.GRP officials however claimed the sequence of events as claimed by Shaw did not match with the evidence they have collected. “We have detained a person involved in the incident and have established the identity of two others who were involved. On Friday evening, Shah and his two Kashmiri friends were sitting near the rail tracks and conversing loudly and using cuss words. Three local youths objected to the use of foul language. There was initially an argument and then they came to blows. While the two friends managed to escape, Shah got trapped and was stabbed,” claimed an IPS officer who is part of the probe team. He added they are investigating claims if there indeed was a robbery. “There are gaps in Shah’s account,” he said.",05 May 2019,2019-05-05 15:50:05,timesofindia.indiatimes

The Convenor of the People's Front, Puti Gaonkar, told the rally that the should file an affidavit in the apex court seeking amendments to the Goa, Daman and Diu Leases (Abolition of Mining Concessions and Declaration as Mining Leases) Act 1987 to make it apply prospectively.
This, he said, would automatically extend the lease period of Goa's iron ore leases -- which have lapsed since 2007 -- till 2037.
""The situation has reached such a pass because the government has taken the issue of mining resumption lightly... We also demand that the Assistant Solicitor General, Atmaram Nadkarni, who represented the case in the Supreme Court, should be replaced with a because he wants the mining leases auctioned and not renewed as we want,"" Gaonkar aid, after submitting a memorandum to
The mining issue has been hanging fire in Goa, ever since the apex court banned extraction and of iron ore from 88 mining leases from March 2018, while also directing the government to re-issue mining leases.
This is the second time in less than a decade that all mining in the state has come to a standstill.
A 2012 ban was earlier lifted by the apex court in 2014, but the court imposed fresh restrictions again in 2018, after it found that the BJP-led government had not followed due procedure in the lease renewal process.
Before Goa was liberated by the Indian armed forces in 1961, mining leases in Goa were permanent concessions granted by the Portuguese colonists for exploration and exploitation.
Once took control of the coastal state, the (Abolition of Concession and Declaration as Mining Leases) act, 1987 converted the same concessions into mining leases under the Mines and Minerals Development Act, 1954, making them valid for a fixed tenure of 20 years, which lapsed in 2007.
Though passed by Parliament in 1987, in the case of Goa, a late entrant into the Indian Union, the law was retrospectively brought into effect from 1961, the year Goa was liberated from the Portuguese.
Gaonkar said that the Front was now demanding that the same law be applied with prospective effect, which would stretch the tenure of the mining leases till 2037.

Bathinda, March 13
The protest by members of the BKU Ekta Ugraha on Wednesday continued for the second day in front of the Co-operative Agricultural Development Bank district branch here. The protesters took out a protest march in the city demanding the return of their blank cheques taken by banks before extending them loan.
They started their march from the protest site and passing along the District Administrative Complex, the bus stand and Powerhouse Road ended at the protest venue. They also raised slogans against the state government and the district administration over ignoring their demands.
Addressing the protesters, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) district president Shingara Singh Mann, Mothu Singh Kotra, Harjinder Singh Baggi, Harpreet Kaur and others said banks, arthiyas and other financial organisations had illegally taken blank cheques from farmers before giving them loans.
They said due to anti-farmer policies, farmers had come under debt and now these banks and other organisations were misusing these blank cheques by filling a wrong amount and were depositing these cheques for clearance. Later, they got a case registered against farmers over this.
Exposing the loan waiver scheme of the state government, they said before the Assembly elections the Congress had promised complete loan waiver. Now it had come up with a loan waiver scheme with conditions, due to which very few farmers have got a relief from debt under the scheme.
They sought a Rs 10-lakh compensation for the family of growers who committed suicides, government job to one of their family members and implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations. Moreover, they also demanded that the state government should stop “forced debt recovery” and release the arrested farmers.
They demanded that instead of waiving the loans completely, the state government was not taking any action against the illegal recovery of loans by banks using blank cheques. They were of the view that despite the High Court’s directions, blank cheques had not been returned. The farmers said they would continue their protest until the cheques were returned.
The farmers protest had become a nuisance for commuters as due to the farmers’ protest the road leading from Bhangu road to Children’s Park had been closed till the Bathinda Press club road crossing. Now, commuters were forced to take a diversion towards the road connecting 100 Feet Road. Similarly, people coming from Powerhouse Road towards the Bathinda Press Club had to divert towards 100 Feet Road near Children’s Park.",20 Mar 2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

They were suspended on Friday for demonstrating against the quality of food in the hostel mess, The Tribune reported.
A committee constituted of the administrative officer and other faculty took the decision to suspend six students and evict them from the hostel, Bar and Bench reported. The suspension order was passed without a formal hearing and in the absence of Vice Chancellor Paramjit Jaswal. The faculty also reportedly confiscated a mobile phone belonging to one of the suspended students.
The protests against the suspensions commenced at 8 pm on Friday evening. “Upon insisting that fundamental right of privacy are being violated, the faculty shamelessly and unreasonably responded with abuses and stated that the students are in no position to teach them the law,” a statement by the protesting students said.
“All the allegations being levelled by students are false,” National Law University Registrar Naresh Kumar said. “Students were suspended for their indiscipline. They were protesting against the suspension, which was done on the recommendation of the committee.” However, he added that the university was considering revoking the suspensions.
Though the protests against the suspensions comprised candle light vigils, a Rapid Action Force was deputed on campus, Bar and Bench reported. Mid-term examinations are scheduled to begin on Monday, and the suspended students have been permitted to take them. However, they must arrive on campus only 10 minutes prior to the exams, and leave within 15 minutes after they are over.
The protestors also sent an application to University Chancellor Krishna Murari, highlighting problems such as unreasonable library timings, restrictions on the mobility of women and their in-timings, incompetent faculty and indifference to sexual harassment complaints.
Murari was scheduled to meet the students on Saturday, but did not do so. Instead, Justice Mahesh Grover, the third senior-most judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, met the protestors. He is a member of the college’s general council.
“Day 3: This is the third straight day into the protest and our demands haven’t been met,” a student of the college tweeted on Sunday. “The authorities aren’t offering any kind of help. None of them [have] even come to talk to us.”

Bathinda, March 13
Farmers under the banner of the BKU Dakonda on Wednesday gheraoed the Chief Agriculture Officer’s office located on the Dabwali road in the city. They were protesting over the problems faced by them regarding the paddy crop.
The protest was headed by BKU Dakonda state president Buta Singh Burjgill and district president Baldev Singh. The protesters first gathered at Gurudwara Hazi Rattan, from where they took out a protest march and reached in front of the Chief Agriculture Officer’s office, where they gehraoed and staged a protest. Later, they submitted a memorandum to Chief Agriculture Officer Gurditta Singh Brar.
Lashing out at the Agriculture Department, Buta Singh Burjgill said the department was misleading the farmers on the issue of depleting groundwater level and keeping the paddy plantation date from June 20. They warned that this policy which is affecting the farmers won’t be tolerated.
Farmers’ leader Gurdeep Singh demanded that paddy plantation should be started by June 1. He said the Agriculture Department was misleading them as the water consumption would be the same whether paddy plantation starts from June 1 or 20.
He said planting the paddy crop late led to many problems as the cold weather led to a hike in the moisture content in the crop and farmers faced the problem of selling the crop at the grain market. Left with no option, they had to sell their crop at a low price to private players.
They demanded the state government should also direct the power department to provide uninterrupted 10-hour power supply to the farmers starting June 1.",20 Mar 2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

Around 500 residents, who have been affected by the plaza, sought its removal.
A. Francis, president of the Federation of Thoraipakkam Residents Welfare Associations, said that two plazas meant for users of the Rajiv Gandhi Salai are located on the Radial Road and on Sholinganallur-Medavakkam Road, both of which are run by the State Highways Department.
The plazas have been constructed by the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company (TNRDC) to collect toll for the Rajiv Gandhi Salai.
Long wait
“Due to the location of the plaza on Radial Road, many vehicles take the internal roads that run through our localities, making our lives difficult. We cannot even cross our streets due to vehicles constantly using them. Call taxis are the worst since they drive very fast,” he said.
K. Kalaiselvan, secretary of the Federation, said that no steps were taken to reduce the waiting time at the plazas leading to internal roads being used to bypass the plazas.
“At the Thoraipakkam plaza zero passes are not given to motorists. Even if someone has to take an internal road like Pillayar Koil Street to reach Kandanchavady, they have to pay the toll,” he added.
Sources in TNRDC said that the tolls had been placed on those roads since locating them closer to RajivGandhi Salai would lead to a constant snarl. “They are satellite plazas,” an official explained.",10 Mar 2019,2019-03-10 00:59:58,thehindu

Party leaders have also started a relay protest to stop the collection of toll. Their main demand is that the company concerned, Soma Enterprises, complete construction of three pending flyovers on the national highway passing through the city.
The three locations are the Basti Jodhewal Chowk, the Sherpur Chowk and the Mohan Dai Oswal Cancer Hospital crossing. The toll for a car going from Ludhiana to Jalandhar, up-down, is ₹185, one of the costlier routes in the region.
MLA Surinder Dawar stopped the functioning of the plaza about 11am on Friday. By 11.30am, high drama was seen as hundreds of Congress workers and leaders thronged the site, and opened the toll barriers. This allowed free passage to vehicles. Heavy police force remained deployed.
“The construction company has failed to meet the deadline of the project that was 2011. The regional office of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and a Vidhan Sabha Committee has recommended that the collection of toll be suspended here. Even the deputy commissioner had recommended the suspension of toll collection in February,” Bittu said, adding that the company had collected around ₹1,800 crore as toll, since collection began in 2009.
“Accidents and traffic congestion are routine despite the toll. Why should Ludhiana residents pay, if they are not provided the infrastructure,” Bittu claimed. State cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, MLAs Sanjay Talwar, Kuldeep Vaid, Dawar and mayor Balkar Sandhu had accompanied the MP.
“The Congress will raze the toll plaza if collection is started before construction on the incomplete stretch begins,” said Vaid. Ashu added, “Congress leaders and workers will sit at the toll plaza everyday. The company will not be allowed to collect toll from residents.”
Designs not approved yet, claims firm
Soma Entreprises deputy general manager, toll operations, Nimesh Tiwari, said, “The project has been delayed as the designs for Sherpur Chowk and Mohan Dai Cancer Hospital Chowk have not been approved. At Basti Jodhewal, work is struck due to hindrances like electricity poles etc.”
On whether the company would lodge a police case against the Congress leadership, Tiwari said, “We will take action after discussion with senior police officials. Our priority is to start toll collection, as it is legal.”
Bittu slams Gadkari, SAD-BJP hits back
Bittu accused Union minister of road transport and highways of not completing work on the project due to vested interest. “Gadkari ensured that work started at Phagwara, but Ludhiana has been ignored for political reasons. The Centre does not want the Congress to get credit for the completion of the project.”
SAD’s Maheshinder Singh Grewal said, “This is gimmicks and cheap politics from Bittu. If the Congress and Bittu are sincere and honest, they should tell their government to deploy police at the toll plaza to ensure it does not function.” BJP district vice-president Parminder Mehta said, “If this is not a political stunt, then Bittu should also stop the MC from charging tax, as the condition of roads and other infrastructure in the city is also in a shambles.”

Employees of several government departments initiated a pen-down strike, under the banner of the Punjab State Ministerial Staff Union, here on Thursday. The union accused the state government of not acting seriously on the issues of the employees.
Association general secretary Jagdish Thakur said, “The health minister, while chairing a meeting on February 27, accepted the demands of the association. But the letter issued by the government on March 5 reveals that the government is not serious. The finance minister has not mentioned anything about the dearness allowance arrears of the period prior to January 1, 2017 due to which the employees are not happy.”
He said that despite the recommendations of the committee of ministers, the committee to look into the issue of revival of old pension scheme for employees recruited after January 2004 has not been constituted.
The union leaders also criticised the state government for its failure to regularise the services of contractual employees. They stated that the pen-down strike would continue till the government issued a notification regarding acceptance of demands.

Ludhiana, March 5
After a break of three days, the students of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana resumed their protest against the university authorities today. The students also launched a chain hunger strike for indefinite time in support of their demands. During the first day of the strike, five university students sat outside the Thapar Hall in the university campus.
The university students have been protesting in support of their demands for the last two weeks. The students had started this protest on February 20 with the demand of lifting ban on the entry of students’ cars in the university campus. The university had banned the entry of four-wheelers of the students during the last month.
Later on, the students also staged a protest and raised slogans against the indifferent attitude of the university authorities. Though the university authorities held some meetings with the representatives of the students during the past some days, the standoff continues as the students are adamant on their demand of lifting ban on entry of students’ cars in the university campus.
The protesting students say that the university authorities have been trying to curb their freedom by imposing certain decisions taken without consulting the students. “We demand from the authorities to lift ban on entry of students’ cars in the university cars. If the authorities want to ban the entry of four-wheelers in the university campus, they should ban entry of all the four-wheelers and not only the cars of the students,” said a student taking part in the protest.
The students were adamant that the authorities either allow entry of their cars in the campus or make the campus completely four-wheeler free. The students said they would continue their chain hunger strike until their demand of allowing entry to their cars in the university campus is met.",20 Mar 2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia
Two BJP Lawmakers Come to Blows in UP,Two BJP Lawmakers Come to Blows in UP,https://thewire.in/politics/abuses-slaps-and-shoes-two-bjp-lawmakers-come-to-blows-in-up,,"New Delhi: When words didn’t work – including hurling the foulest of abuses at each other – two BJP legislators from Uttar Pradesh resorted to hitting each other with fists and shoes over a disagreement on the names printed on foundation stones for projects.
The blows occurred on Wednesday evening during a district planning committee meeting in UP’s Sant Kabir Nagar, about 200 kms from Lucknow, in full public glare. The meeting was being attended by senior administration, police officers as well as Ashutosh Tandon, the BJP minister-in-charge of the district, who even attempted to stop the fight, Indian Express reported.
According to NDTV, the fight – videos of which has been doing the rounds on social media and news channels – broke out after the local BJP MP, Sharad Tripathi demanded to know why his name was not included on the foundation stone for a road. When Tripathi questioned Public Works Department engineers at the meeting over the issue, Rakesh Baghel, an MLA from the district, interrupted and said: “Ask me about this, I have put in the stones.”
He can be further heard saying it was his decision and that Tripathi should speak “to his shoe.”
As per videos, this got Tripathi riled up and after a brief exchange of words, he took off a shoe and began landing blows one after another on Baghel, leaving officials and party leaders stunned. Those around can be heard asking in astonishment, “Kya ho raha hai bhai ye? (What is happening here?)”
Baghel responded by using slaps. While it is being reported that he too took off his shoe and responded in a similar manner as Tripathi, this part remains unclear from clips of the incident.
Police officials and others can be seen pulling the duo apart, eventually succeeding to end the brawl.
According to Scroll.in, Baghel and his supporters later protested outside Sant Kabir Nagar District Magistrate Raveesh Gupta’s office demanding Tripathi’s arrest.
The party state president Mahendra Nath Pandey took “serious” cognisance of the incident and summoned both the lawmakers to the state capital.
“I have taken serious cognisance of the incident and have summoned both of them to Lucknow. Disciplinary action will take as per the party discipline,” said Pandey.
Opposition leaders came down heavily on the ruling party, with Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav tweeting that the incident was reflective of BJP’s frustration over its impending defeat in the upcoming polls:
“Today in Uttar Pradesh, a parliamentarian and a legislator of the party – that claims to the world’s most disciplined – respectfully exchanged blows with their shoes. This is the frustration of the BJP that is expecting a defeat in the upcoming elections. The truth is that the BJP is not being able to find candidates for the polls.”
According to Indian Express, Tripathi said he regretted the incident: “What happened was against my normal behaviour. If I am summoned by the state chief then I will put my point across.”

Around 11.25am, ABVP members, including some girls, assembled outside the gates of the Purulia Road institution and shouted slogans against the missionary institution, alleging it was hand-in-glove with the Congress and promoted religious conversion in the name of social service. The demonstration lasted for 40 minutes till Lower Bazar policemen reached to mediate a meeting between a delegation of ABVP and principal Sister Mary Grace.
Denying ABVP’s allegations, Sister Grace said she had taken her students to Morabadi because Rahul Gandhi, as Congress president, was a national figure and young students had every right to meet him.
Contacted, Sister Grace said she had taken 60 girls to Rahul Gandhi’s rally. The school has 4,600 students.
“I had taken 60 students to the Rahul Gandhi’s rally on the invitation of Rama Khalkho and Prabhakar Tirkey, two tribal leaders affiliated to the Congress. My intention was to give students an opportunity to meet a national figure as they are young and have voting rights also. I would have sent them to Narendra Modi’s rally too if they had got an invitation from the party (the BJP). I don’t think I did anything wrong,” Sister Grace said.
She also said the ABVP demonstration on Tuesday was “uncalled for”.
“Many of the those participating in the demonstration were our old students against whom I had taken disciplinary action. They know me very well for my strong discipline,” she added.
Contacted, state organising secretary of ABVP Yagya-walkya Shukla justified the demonstration saying they we-re protesting an attempt to po-liticise an educational institution towards one political party.
“The institution, which does not hoist the national flag on Independence Day and Republic Day and hardly organises condolence meeting in case of deaths of national leaders, is sending students to attend a political rally? That is a matter of concern. We will take up the matter before Jharkhand Academic Council to cancel the affiliation of such an educational institution,” Shukla said.
Asked, Lower Bazar OC Satish Kumar said the situation had been controlled. “The demonstration was peaceful. No property was damaged. Delegates (ABVP members) returned after a dialogue with school principal,” the OC said.
ABVP had, in the wake of the February 14 Pulwama terror attack, compelled St Xavier’s College, also on Purulia Road, to postpone its annual fest Xavier Utsav on February 20.",05 Mar 2019,2019-03-05 18:43:52,telegraphindia

The police took action after an FIR was lodged by one of the journalists, Chandan Bhattacharya of ETV (Bihar-Jharkhand), who sustained head injuries.
Bhattacharya was first rushed to the district hospital and then RIMS where he had to be administered eight stitches.
S.N. Mandal, officer in-charge of Kotwali police station, said the accused had been kept in the lock-up.
“We have kept the two university employees in the lock-up. They will be produced before court and sent to Birsa Munda Central Jail for 14 days,” he said.
In his FIR, Bhattacharya said he along with two other journalists — Sandeep Kumar of Kashish News and Anjani Kumar of News 11 — had gone to the university after receiving information about a students’ stir owing to the late opening of the counter in the examination department.
“While we were trying to click pictures of the department, Mohammed Kaifi and Surya Bhusan Shahbadi, along with five other employees, used abusive language and assaulted me with a rod. When Sandeep and Anjani tried to save me, they were attacked as well,” Bhattacharya said.
None of the university officials, including vice chancellor Ramesh Kumar Pandey and pro-vice chancellor Kamini Kumar, was available for comments.
A varsity source said the two men who were detained were associated with the examination department.
“Police have detained Pushkar Kumar and Surya Bhushan Shahbadi, associated with the examination department, for attacking the journalists around 11.30am,” the source said.
He said Shahbadi had a criminal background and action had been taken against him for brash behaviour when A.A. Khad was vice chancellor.",27 Feb 2019,2019-02-27 18:49:32,telegraphindia

Mangai* was allegedly subjected to a casteist slur while she was sexually assaulted by a man in Ariyalur district on February 27.
Mangai*, a 26-year-old Dalit woman, was on her way to a ration shop in her locality in Ariyalur district to submit a form to buy subsidised rice for her family. But the trip on February 27 turned into a nightmare for Mangai after a Vanniyar man allegedly accosted her with a knife, raped her for an hour and hurled casteist abuses at her.
Mangai and her husband Maran*, a daily wage labourer, live with their two children and Maran’s parents in Ariyalur. The couple belong to the Parayan community, which is a Scheduled Caste community in Tamil Nadu.
On Wednesday afternoon last week, Mangai, a homemaker, was walking to the ration shop nearby to submit the required form for groceries under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) scheme, under which eligible families can purchase 35 kg of rice at Rs 2 per kilo. But the person-in-charge was not present, so Mangai decided to return home to manage her household work instead of waiting at the shop.
But Mangai was intercepted by Gopi, a man belonging to the Vanniyar caste, an OBC community that is dominant in Tamil Nadu. Mangai begged him to leave her alone, but he allegedly assaulted and verbally abused her, then raped her. Mangai's ordeal is detailed in an FIR filed at the Ariyalur AWPS.
“I've known Gopi for the past three years. He works with a tractor. My mother-in-law and I have gone to his house to work and that is all I know of him. After that he used to look at me in a wrong way and show gestures regularly which I used to ignore. On Wednesday, when I was coming back from the ration shop, he intercepted me and forced me to go with him. When I refused and moved forward, he grabbed me from behind by my hair,” according to the FIR.
Narrating her painful experience, the FIR also mentions that Gopi allegedly used a casteist slur against her while sexually assaulting her, and threatened to kill her if she shouted for help.
“He held a knife close to my neck, raped me for an hour and escaped from the spot. I somehow struggled to get up and then went home and narrated the incident to my mother-in-law,” Mangai says, in the FIR. Speaking to TNM about the incident, Mangai says that since Maran was out of town on Wednesday, she went to the police station with her father-in-law. However, she adds that the police in the station were anything but cooperative in registering an FIR.
“I have studied only till class 7. Hence I don’t know the procedure much. The one who took down my complaint was in fact on the phone with the father of the accused. I fear that the police will side with them,” she told TNM.
TNM spoke to a police officer in the Ariyalur police station where the FIR was filed. “We have registered an FIR under section 376 (Rape) and 506 (Criminal intimidation) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The accused has been arrested and remanded,” the police officer said. However, the district police denied succumbing to any form of pressure in the investigation.
Maran, however, tells TNM that the issue is not about a single incident, but about the plight of Dalit communities. “Now this happened to my wife, what is the guarantee that it will not happen to an unmarried young girl? I want justice for my wife and a better society for the future generations of my caste. My wife was raped because of the fact that we cannot do anything as we are from an oppressed caste. I want this notion gone,” he says.

The 28-year-old CRPF jawan, identified as Ashok Ingavale, alleged that he was assaulted and handcuffed by police officials, but the Pune rural police, in a statement, have denied allegations of any physical assault.
“He is undergoing medical tests and we will initiate an inquiry into the allegations,” said Sandeep Pakhale, additional superintendent of police, Pune rural police.
The tests are being conducted to ascertain the extent of his injuries and to verify whether he was under the influence of alcohol.
The CRPF jawan, on leave from his place of posting, said he was visiting the police station in order to seek permission to hold a protest rally against the terrorist attack on a CRPF convoy that claimed lives of at least 40 jawans in Pulwama on February 14.
A source in the know-how of the inquiry, on the condition of anonymity, stated that the jawan arrived at the police station riding a two-wheeler with two other men seated on it. When Ingavale entered the police station, he was questioned by police officials for riding triple-seat while in uniform, however, he started arguing with the policemen and used foul language, alleged the source.
The policemen, then, took him to an adjacent room where he started damaging chairs in rage. After the resultant fight, he walked to the lock-up and sat there himself, according to the source. “We have CCTV (closed circuit television) footage of him entering the lock-up,” the source added.
Ingavale, however, paints a different version of the incident. “I offered to pay the fine for riding triple-seat, but the officials did not listen to me. They further alleged that I was drunk. The police personnel, then, took me to a room where there was no CCTV. I was beaten up by 10 to 15 police personnel, my uniform was torn and I was handcuffed,” he alleged, adding that the policemen even abused him.
Ingawale denied that he was drunk. “There is no question of me being drunk because I have been working for the cause of alcohol de-addiction in the area. So, the allegations leveled by police are baseless and need to be investigated,” he said.
Ajit Pawar, former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra and a leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), while addressing a rally in Baramati, said, “The jawans who are protecting us are being beaten up by the police. The law and order situation is questionable. If there is any truth to that news, I register my vehemently protest it,” he said.

Activist Goes Missing Hours After Incriminating Top Cops in Thoothukudi Massacre,Activist Goes Missing Hours After Incriminating Top Cops in Thoothukudi Massacre,https://thewire.in/rights/environmental-activist-missing-thoothukudi-massacre-police,,"Chennai: Two days after environmental activist S. Mugilan allegedly went missing from a train while travelling to Madurai from Chennai, the Madras high court has directed the Chennai police commissioner and the SPs of Villupuram and Kanchipuram to respond by February 22 to the habeas corpus petition filed by human rights defender and People’s Watch founder Henri Tiphagne.
Expressing his concern over the missing activist, Henri Tiphagne said, “The Villupuram police have denied arresting him in the court. In the backdrop of the Supreme Court judgment on Sterlite on Monday, we are really worried that Mugilan is in serious danger now.”
The Supreme Court had set aside the NGT order allowing Sterlilte to reopen on account of maintainability and had asked Sterlite to approach the high court.

Days before the judgment, on February 15, Mugilan had met journalists in Chennai to release a documentary – Koluthiyathu Yaar? Maraikkapatta Unmaigal (Who burnt it? The Hidden Truths).
In the video, he incriminates the Thoothukudi police of having orchestrated the shooting of anti-Sterlite protestors on May 22 last year. Putting together video clippings from various sources, Mugilan says the ‘shooting was well planned’ by the police and he accused IPS officers Shailesh Kumar Yadav and Kapil Kumar Saratkar of orchestrating it.
﻿
Hours later, after boarding a train to Madurai from Chennai, Mugilan went missing. His phone was reachable till 1.45 am on February 16, but since then, it has been switched off.
Mugilan has not reached Madurai as planned, and activists believe he may have been illegally detained by the police.
Meeting reporters at Thanjavur today, MDMK leader Vaiko expressed fear that Mugilan could havebeen killed in an encounter or detained illegally. “The Tamil Nadu police and Sterlite administration should be held responsible” he said.
Mugilan, an activist with the Tamil Nadu environmental protection movement, has been one of the most vociferous voices on environmental issues in the state. He has been in the forefront of various struggles, including against illegal sand quarrying, Koodankulam, for Cauvery river and Jallikattu. He has been facing over 15 cases including sedition.
Mugilan was arrested under 13 cases related to anti Koodankulam struggle in September 2017, shortly after he took part in a struggle against Sterlite in Thoothukudi. He was released in September 2018 after his lawyer obtained bails in all the cases.
Mugilan’s associates say there has been a precedent. “In March 2012, when he was struggling against Koodankulam plant, Mugilan he was illegally picked up by police for three days and then let off,” one said, asking not to be named.
Also read: Tamil Nadu Police Shot Anti-Sterlite Protestors in Head, Chest: Report
Even at the press meet on February 15, Mugilan had voiced his fear that by releasing the video ‘evidence’, he was putting his life in danger.
In the 46-minute video, Mugilan seeks to establish that the ‘police’ had used a huge iron ladder to destroy two CCTV cameras prior to the shooting.
He says that Shailesh Kumar Yadav “had seen the iron ladder while inspecting, yet said nothing about it”. Mugilan also says the police had deliberately directed the protesting crowd towards the direction where there where now no CCTV cameras. Mugilan also seeks to establish that the protestors had not committed any arson, as had been claimed by administration as the reason for firing.
In the video, Mugilan also demands that the one-member commission to enquire into the shooting should file its interim report and that the autopsy reports of those killed in the shooting be released immediately. He has also demanded the arrests of the police officers concerned.",19 Feb 2019,2019-02-19 00:00:00,thewire.in
Migrant labourers targeted in Kodagu,Migrant labourers targeted in Kodagu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/migrant-labourers-targeted-in-kodagu/article26369238.ece,en,"Migrant labourers in Kodagu, who have emerged as the mainstay of the workforce in coffee plantations across the district, have become the target of ire of a section of locals, with the Kodagu Growers’ Federation alleging that two or three instances of assault against them have taken place in the past few days.
The recent arrest of two workers from West Bengal in connection with the rape and murder of a pre-university student in a coffee estate in Kodagu has given an excuse to the locals, who have been facing the heat of unemployment, to train their guns on migrant workers, who are mostly from the Northeast.
Sundar Raj, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Madikeri, said demonstrations were held by local organisations taking up the cause of the rape and murder victim in Siddapura, but no case of assault against migrant workers was reported so far. The demonstrators have demanded that the workers be sent back to their native places.
However, the Kodagu Growers’ Federation and the Kodagu Planters’ Federation have alleged that two or three instances of assault on migrant labourers from Assam have taken place in south Kodagu even though formal police complaints have not been lodged.
The Kodagu Loaders’ Association president Bharat, who also heads the Gram Panchayat Workers’ Association of Kodagu, traced the origin of the discontent among locals to estate owners preference for migrant labourers after tribals, who had for ages worked as bonded labourers, began demanding fair wages.
Plantation owners are employing migrant labourers for their own convenience, but local workers, contractors and transporters have come together to exploit the rape case to their advantage, Mr. Bharat said. He added that certain forces were also trying to give a communal twist to the issue by targeting minority community workers from Assam.
The targeting of migrant labourers by locals comes in the backdrop of an exercise taken up by the police to collect details of all migrant labourers employed by estate owners. The police exercise, which began after a worker from Assam murdered his wife, had been intensified after the rape and murder case.
“The migrant workers have pressed the panic button in the wake of the assaults by locals and are planning to return to their native places,” said Vishwanth, spokesperson, Karnataka Growers’ Federation.
The Kodagu growers’ and planters’ federations have condemned the rape and murder while demanding punishment of the culprits. They have also come down on locals for targeting the entire migrant workforce using the crime as an excuse.
A representative of the growers’ federation said they preferred migrant labourers as they were willing to work till late in the day and put in overtime for incentives. But local labourers, who are even ferried from nearby places such as Periyapatna and parts of Hassan and Mysuru, leave estates early.
“Though they start by 10 a.m., they pack up around 3.30 or 4 p.m. saying they have a long journey home, leaving the work incomplete.”
Misuse of rape victim’s identityThe identity of the PU student who was raped and killed in a coffee estate in Siddapura police limits earlier this month has been misused by various organisations in Kodagu.
Madikeri Deputy Superintendent of Police Sundar Raj said a section of local workers have formed a struggle committee in the name of the victim. Various organisations are liberally using her name in press statements, which then appear in the local media.
Disclosing the name of a rape victim, even after her death, is barred under Section 228A of the Indian Penal Code.",26 Feb 2019,2019-02-26 01:19:39,thehindu

KOLKATA: Two days after the murder of Trinamool Congress MLA Satyajit Biswas, another party leader in West Bengal, who was allegedly involved in the ruckus during BJP president Amit Shah’s rally at Kanthi last month, was found dead at Dadpur in Hooghly district on Monday morning.
Ritesh Roy was TMC president of three gram panchayat samitis in Kanthi in the Purba Medinipur district. Said to be close to transport minister and party strongman Suvendu Adhikari, Ritesh had been missing since February 7.
A deep black mark was found around his neck, making the police suspect that he might have been strangled to death using a rope. The body has been sent for autopsy.
His wife Mahua Roy said Ritesh left his house at Chandberia village in Purba Medinipur on February 7 saying he was going to Kolaghat in the same district, but called up at 9 pm to say that he was off to Malda with a friend.
The family filed a missing complaint at Marishda police station on February 9.The TMC has pointed a finger at the BJP for the suspicious death. “The BJP has conspired to kill him,” said Purba Medinipur TMC secretary Kanishka Panda. Refuting his allegations, BJP’s Kanthi mandal chief Mahesh Sur said: “The BJP will never do such a thing. This might be a conspiracy of TMC leaders in Kanthi or a case of infighting.”
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee visited the family of slain Krishnaganj MLA Satyajit Biswas and promised to drag BJP leader Mukul Roy, who was booked in the case a day ago, and others to jail, if proven guilty.
Without naming Roy, who was one of the founders of Trinamool Congress before switching to the BJP last year, Banerjee, the president of TMC youth wing and Daimond Harbour MP, said: “If someone is thinking he will conspire the murder of Satyajit Biswas and get saved by hanging on to the pyjamas of Delhi leaders, I assure that if and when proven guilty, we will hold him by his collar and drag him to jail.”
Ruling out TMC infighting behind the murder, Banerjee alleged that Sujit Mondal and Kartik Mondal, also booked in the case, were BJP workers. Food Minister Jyotipriya Mullick and Bangaon MP and Matua leader Mamata Thakur also blamed the BJP.",10 Feb 2019,2019-02-10 00:00:00,newindianexpress
Dalit youth alleges torture at police station in Arkalgud taluk,Dalit youth alleges torture at police station in Arkalgud taluk,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dalit-youth-alleges-torture-at-police-station-in-arkalgud-taluk/article26518660.ece,en,"A young Dalit of Konanur in Arkalgud taluk has alleged that the police staff at Konanur police station tortured him, though there was no complaint against him. Pro-Dalit organisations of the district are taking out a rally in Hassan on Wednesday, demanding suspension of four police staff, including a PSI.
Pradeep K.V, 23, a vegetable seller at Ambedkar Colony, on Tuesday told The Hindu that he was on the way to meet one of his customers at Konanur on February 10 when he noticed a group of youths fighting among themselves. As he stopped his bike, two constables reached the place, forcing the gathering to flee the place. The police caught him for no reason and beat him up severely. “They wanted to know where I was from. The moment I said I was from Ambedkar Colony in Konanur, they scolded me taking my caste and referred to me a cow-eater. They constables pushed me to the ground and stood on my chest. I was in pain”, he said.
According to Pradeep, the police took him to the police station, where he was again tortured throughout the night. Only the next evening was he released. “The police staff had a party in the station, where they had food and liquor. The police, in an inebriated mood, tortured me throughout the night"", he said.
For the last one month, he has been taking rest, without any earning. The doctors, who treated him at Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences, have noticed injuries and recommended rest for two months. The police have refused to register his complaint against the officials.
SP’s reaction
Leaders of Dalit Sangharsha Samiti’s different wings will be taking out a protest march in Hassan demanding action against the officers. Prakash Gowda, SP, admitted that the police beat him up while dispersing a mob engaged in a fight on that evening, but denied the allegation that he was kept in the police station and was tortured. “We have inquired into the whole incident. There was no mistake by the staff. I have also appealed to the leaders not to take out protest on this issue. The pro-Dalit leaders of Arkalgud taluk are in support of our staff. Some people have been misled”, he said.",13 Mar 2019,2019-03-13 10:05:09,thehindu

The incident took place around midnight on the Outer Ring Road, barely 300 metres from a police picket, when ASI Bedi Ram was on his way home to Seelampur after completing his shift at Nizamuddin police station.
Witnesses said the two assailants had also allegedly robbed another man of his cash and mobile phone minutes before targeting the policeman. Police are yet to make any arrest.
According to police, as ASI Ram crossed Vijay Ghat to reach an underpass on the Outer Ring Road, two men on a motorcycle intercepted him.
Ankur Panchal, who had informed the police control room about the incident, said he stopped after spotting the ASI crying for help. “His clothes were drenched in blood and he was trying to stop cars for help. I and four of my colleagues were in a car and we were heading towards the Iron Bridge when we saw him and stopped by. I got down and called 100,” Panchal, who works as a news analyst at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said.
By the time, another man who alleged that he had also been attacked and robbed by the two men, who shot the policeman, arrived at the spot with some policemen, Panchal said. “He told us that when he was coming from Jama Masjid side, the two men on a Bullet motorcycle intercepted him and snatched about ₹40,000 and his mobile phone and purse. He said the two men then approached the policemen and shot him following a scuffle. The man said he rushed to a police post near the Yamuna Iron Bridge and asked for help,” Panchal said.
The police then rushed ASI Ram to Lok Nayak hospital from where he was moved to AIIMS Trauma Centre. Ram underwent a surgery and the bullet was removed, police said.
Police said Ram was in uniform but was wearing a jacket because of which he was probably mistaken for a civilian by the suspects.
Additional deputy commissioner of police (north) Harendra Kumar Singh said they are yet to record the ASI’s statement to know the exact sequence of incident. “We have registered a case of attempt to murder at Kotwali police station. The ASI’s phone is missing but we are not sure if the two men took it or it was misplaced during the scuffle. We are also looking into the possibility of personal enmity behind the attack,” Singh said, adding that they have formed teams to scan possible suspects from previous cases that the ASI had investigated.
The additional DCP, however, said he did not have reports on the alleged robbery that could have triggered the shooting. “We have not received any complaint from anyone so far,” he said.
“We have been told that the accused were on a Bullet motorcycle and therefore CCTV footage from the vicinity of the crime spot are being checked to trace the registration number of all the bikes of same make that passed from the spot around that time,” the officer said.

"Suspected Muslim rebels storm Thai temple, kill 2 monks","Suspected Muslim rebels storm Thai temple, kill 2 monks",https://www.apnews.com/578928ab6d534cb6ab4fc278a152015a,,"HAT YAI, Thailand (AP) — Gunmen presumed to be Muslim insurgents stormed a Buddhist temple in southern Thailand, killing two monks and wounding two others, police said Saturday.
The Friday night attack in Narathiwat province was the latest in a recent upsurge of violence in the area, which since 2004 has been plagued by a separatist insurgency that has claimed about 7,000 lives. Narathiwat is one of Thailand’s three southernmost provinces, the only ones with Muslim majorities in the Buddhist-dominated country.
Witnesses described seeing armed men arrive at the temple on motorcycles, open fire with automatic weapons and then storm inside where they shot the monks in their quarters, according to Thai news report. One of those killed was the temple’s abbot.
The temple attack was one of several violent incidents in Narathiwat on Friday, including a roadside bombing that wounded five members of security forces, and a shootout between paramilitary rangers and five armed men that left one of the gunmen dead. The others escaped.
The attacks have occurred during an effort to revitalize peace talks between the Thai government and some insurgent groups, and may be an effort to scuttle them by stoking popular outrage and inviting heavy handed retaliation. Analysts say the most militant group, the Barisan Revolusi Nasional, BRN, is not taking part in the talks.
The New York-based group Human Rights Watch has pinned the blame for the ongoing violence on the BRN.
“The ghastly attack on Buddhist monks by insurgents in Thailand’s deep south is morally reprehensible and a war crime, and those responsible should be held to account,” said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The insurgents’ 15-year campaign of deliberately attacking Buddhist and Muslim civilians can’t be justified.”
The watchdog said that since the insurgency flared up in January 2004, BRN’s members have targeted Buddhist temples and monks because they consider them emblematic of the Thai Buddhist state’s “occupation” of ethnic Malay Muslim territory. At least 23 monks have been killed and more than 20 wounded, it said.
The insurgents have also targeted security personnel assigned to provide monks safe passage to and from the temples, it said.
Buddhist temples often serve as community centers, and monks are revered in Thailand. There is fear that attacks on temples could trigger vigilante action by Buddhist civilians against Muslims.
“This is a very brazen act to drive a wedge among people,” Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, a human rights defender, told The Associated Press. “The cause of the conflict in the south is originally between the government and locals. But this is an attempt to turn the conflict to be between two religions,” she added.
She said there are victims on both sides, noting that on Jan. 11, an Imam — a Muslim community leader — was gunned down. A lack of transparency in the judicial system makes it difficult to assign blame for the violence, said Pornpen, who also heads the Cross Cultural Foundation, which monitors and documents cases of torture and ill-treatment.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha condemned the violence and ordered security officers to find the culprits, said government spokesman Puttipong Punnakanta.",19 Jan 2019,2019-01-19 07:44:24,apnews

24 Men Charged Over Assault on Bangkok Temple School,24 Men Charged Over Assault on Bangkok Temple School,http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/crimecourtscalamity/crime-crime/2019/02/26/24-men-charged-over-assault-on-bangkok-temple-school/,en,"BANGKOK — Multiple charges have now been brought against two dozen men accused of raiding a Bangkok school during university admission tests, police said Tuesday.
A total of 24 suspects, all male, have now been charged with six counts including trespassing, vandalism, assault, intimidation and consuming alcohol on temple grounds following Sunday’s attack on the Matthayom Wat Sing School, according to the Bang Khun Thian district police chief.
One suspect was charged with sexually harassing a minor, Col. Luesak Damnoensawas said. It followed complaints from a student who said one of the men kissed her cheek and verbally harassed her while she tried to break up a fight between them and her friend.
Investigators today raided the homes of 16 suspects for drugs and weapons but said they came up empty-handed.
Dozens of men stormed the campus Sunday afternoon and assaulted guards, students and teachers in classrooms after the school asked that an ordination ceremony at the temple be quiet as university admission tests were being administered to more than 300 students.
A teacher said he was assaulted by multiple men and sustained serious injuries to his arm after being hit by a chair and table. A student said he was struck in the head. The school’s director said some men charged into his office and punched him.
The ringleader was identified by police as Wallop Nutfaeng, 32, who apologized in tears to students, teachers and school security guards during a police raid on his house.
He said he wanted to talk to the school’s director and got angry when he couldn’t find him. He also admitted to being drunk.
﻿﻿﻿
Security footage shows the men walk through the school’s front gate, some holding liquor bottles, and start attacking the school guards attempting to stop them almost immediately. Wallop was seen leading the group.
Police said 20 men will be held at the Thon Buri Criminal Court, while the four minors would be sent to a local juvenile detention center. They said three more suspects would be called in for questioning.
The court on Tuesday afternoon denied bail for all suspects, saying they pose a threat to witnesses and could disrupt the investigation.
The attack drew outrage from the public. The police commissioner has promised swift prosecution of the assailants, while junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha joined the public to condemn the incident online and command that all perpetrators be “dealt with seriously and urgently.”
Education officials said affected students can retake the tests next week. The Education Minister said Monday that they were looking into whether they would sue the attackers for the cost of rescheduling the tests.

Kurukshetra University Students on Indefinite Hunger Strike Against Rustication of 19 Students,Kurukshetra University Students on Indefinite Hunger Strike Against Rustication of 19 Students,https://www.newsclick.in/kurukshetra-university-students-indefinite-hunger-strike-against-rustication-19-students,en,"On March 17, nineteen students were rusticated from Kurukshetra University, Haryana, for protesting against the lack of basic facilities in the university. The affected students are members of the Joint Students’ Struggle Committee, a body comprising of members of the campus’ students’ organisations. Some of the rusticated students have been restricted from entering the university campus indefinitely, while a few have been restricted only for the current session.
The students were rusticated for participating in an agitation that was held on February 28. The agitation was organised to protest against the increase in mess fees, poor quality of food in the mess, and to demand conducting of the backlog examinations within three months of result. This is when the Joint Students’ Struggle Committee (JSSC) was formed by the students’ organisations active in the campus.
The Committee consists of students from Students’ Federation of India (SFI), Chhatra Ekta Manch, Disha Chhatra Sangathan, and other students’ organisations. Convener of the Joint Students’ Struggle Committee, Vinod Gill, told NewsClick, “Our movement against the administration lasted for exactly one month and five days.”
During the agitation on February 28, the police had detained 44 students. They were released later in the day. The Students’ Struggle committee protested against this move, following which the administration met the students, and agreed to most of their demands. They said that a committee will be formed to look into the issues being faced by the students. The VC was also present at the meeting. However, soon after this, the rustication order was given to 19 students.
Seven out of the nineteen rusticated students started an indefinite hunger strike on March 26, demanding immediate roll back of the rustication order. Sumit Singh, one of the rusticated students, who is also the Haryana State Vice President of SFI, told NewsClick, “The students have their final examinations coming up, and instead of preparing for the exams, they have been forced to come out on the street for their rights.”

Suman, State President of SFI, told NewsClick, “The Vice Chancellor was the All India President of ABVP. He is clearly a right-winger, and has problems with SFI members. That is why he rusticated us, along with others for raising slogans against him. It is not our fault, we were the ones fighting for our rights. It is the VC who refused to meet us and listen to our demands, and instead, rusticated us.”
Eight days after the hunger strike started, several of the protesters have been hospitalised. Jyoti, one of the students sitting on the hunger strike is in a critical condition, as her health deteriorated rapidly.
Singh said, “The parents of the protesting students have been called. Several parents visited the campus to talk to the administration. The Proctorial Board has agreed to hold a meeting tomorrow to determine the fate of the rusticated students. The protest will not be stopped until the rustication is rolled back.”

Citizenship bill protest: Six women injured in Manipur's Imphal following clash with cops; Section 144 imposed,Citizenship bill protest: Six women injured in Manipur's Imphal following clash with cops; Section 144 imposed,https://www.firstpost.com/india/citizenship-bill-protest-six-women-injured-in-manipurs-imphal-following-clash-with-cops-section-144-imposed-6066611.html,,"Imphal: Six women sustained injuries when the police fired tear gas shells and smoke bombs at a marketplace here to disperse protesters, who had enforced a road blockade demanding withdrawal of the citizenship bill, according to a vendors' association at the market.
There was, however, no immediate official confirmation about the incident.
Shantidevi, the president of an association of women vendors at Khwairamband market here, claimed that the police on Sunday used force on the agitators, who had been protesting peacefully.
The women vendors at the market here had put up posters and banners and set up tents, blocking roads, to press for their demand, she said.
Prohibitory orders under section 144 of CrPc have been imposed in the area in the wake of agitations against the contentious bill.
Shantidevi said the police tried to pull down the tents and tear apart the posters and banners that sought the unconditional revocation of the bill.
The women, however, refused to cow down, following which a clash broke out between the two sides, she said.
""The security officers fired tear gas shells and smoke bombs, which left six women injured. The situation turned uglier when they tried to take one of the injured women into custody and the agitators had to thwart the attempt,"" Shantidevi claimed.
The injured women were then taken to Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIIMS), she added.
Criticising the use of ""excessive force"", Y Dillipkumar, the convenor of Manipur Peoples Against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (MANPAC), said the women were ""protesting in a democratic manner"". ""The assault on the women vendors indicates that the state government is acting under the command of the Union government,"" he said.
MANPAC is an umbrella body of civil societies and organisations that had been protesting against the passage of the legislation.
Dillipkumar asserted that the agitation against the bill will intensify in the days to come.
""The members of MANPAC, along with common people, will hit the streets seeking withdrawal of the bill and implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise in the state to weed out illegal immigrants,"" he added.
Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh had earlier said that the BJP-led government in the state would not support the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill unless there was a provision to protect the people of the northeast.
Meanwhile, security has been beefed up across Imphal Monday in the wake of the agitation. A large number of security personnel belonging to state and paramilitary forces have been deployed in Imphal to avoid any untoward situation.
The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, passed by Lok Sabha on January 8, seeks to grant nationality to non-Muslims who fled religious persecution from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and entered India before 31 December, 2014.
Protests against the bill have rocked the entire northeast over the past six weeks, with several organisations and political parties claiming that the bill threatens the identity, language and culture of indigenous people.

CHENNAI: A complaint has been lodged against a police officer for allegedly attacking a 22-year-old young man during a vehicle check near Chetpet.
Speaking to Express, Ameer Sultan, a friend of the victim, said three boys had attended a marriage function and were returning home on two bikes towards Choolaimedu. “As they were riding at the Harrington Road, they were stopped by policemen to check their documents. However, the victim, Haroon, showed all the documents. But the Sub-Inspector insisted that he showed the original RC book,” said Ameer.
“However, Haroon handed over the bike key to the SI so that he would bring the RC book to the station in the morning, but wanted an acknowledgement that his bike would be at the station. Angered by this, the SI began attacking Haroon with a lathi,” the friend added. “He sustained severe injuries on his hands and legs.”
Later, the victim lodged a complaint with the Assistant Commissioner of Police. A senior police officer said the victim had produced the xerox of the RC book in which the vehicle registration number was different from the bike he was riding. “When he was asked to produce the original documents, a quarrel broke out between the police and Haroon,” he added.",21 Jul 2018,2018-07-21 00:00:00,newindianexpress

In a related move, mobile internet and SMS services have been suspended in four districts of Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr till April 16. As per the order, mobile internet services, including 2G, 3G, 4G, CDMA and GPRS, all SMS services and all dongle services provided on mobile networks, except voice calls, will remain suspended.
Those held on Sunday were senior state vice-president of Shiv Sena (Bal Thackeray) Inderjit Karwal; Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Suraksha Samiti state president Deepak Bhardwaj, Shiv Sena leader Shivi Batta and one Rajiv Chahal.
They have been booked for attempt to murder, hurting religious sentiments and other sections of the IPC. A local court has remanded them in judicial custody for 14 days. Around 100 people, including 33 by name, were booked on Saturday.
Adding to the tension, residents of Dalit-dominated Subash Nagar locality put up barricades at the entry points, like the Valmiki Chowk and others, denying access to the police, the media and even political leaders. Only those from the Scheduled Castes were allowed. They are demanding the cancellation of the First-Information Reports (FIRs) against members of their community. Police had deployed heavy security.
“Members of Hindu right-wing organisations created ruckus and clashed with the Dalits. They tore down our religious posters and also opened fire, injuring five of us,” Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) leader Jarnail Nangal claimed, demanding the cancellation of the FIR against himself and other Dalits in Friday’s clashes.
Meetings held to restore normalcy
Later in the day, Kapurthala district Congress committee president Joginder Singh Mann met members of the Ambedkar Sena. “Initially, some BJP workers did not allow me to enter the locality. Later, I met members of the Ambedkar Sena,” Mann said. Representatives of the General Samaj Manch also met the SSP and the DC against the arrests.
“Police are biased and have not arrested anyone from the opposite group,” claimed organisation president, Vijay Sharma. SSP Sandeep Sharma said, “Four people have been arrested. As more evidence emerges, there will be more arrests, but after an inquiry.”
CM warns culprits
Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has also taken note of the situation and warned of strict action. “We will not allow Punjab’s peace to be disturbed at any cost and culprits will be punished. The government will bear all expenses for the treatment of those injured in the incident,” he said.
Deputy commissioner Mohammad Tayyab said, “We will bear the treatment cost. The Kaputhala Red Cross Society has released Rs 1.25 lakh for the treatment of Kulwinder, one of the injured, who is undergoing treatment at a private hospital.”

In a dramatic showdown with the Narendra Damodardas Modi government, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has begin a Save The Constitution dharna after a standoff between the Kolkata police and Central Bureau of Investigation officers on Sunday, February 3.
The CBI officers wanted to question Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar over two chit fund scams, but Bureau agents were instead taken to a local police station and detained.
Banerjee later staged a dharna and blamed the Centre for 'a total Constitutional breakdown'.
The chief minister also alleged that National Security Advisor Ajit Doval was directing the CBI to harass political opponents on the prime minister's orders.
""If Mamata Banerjee's team is so clean, then let them face the charges in court and come out clean,"" Dilip Ghosh -- president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal unit who declared that Mamata could be prime minister last month -- tells Rediff.com's Syed Firdaus Ashraf.
Mamata Banerjee alleges that the CBI is acting on Prime Minister Modi and (BJP national President) Amit (Anilchandra) Shah's instructions.
She is saying that she is on a dharna to save democracy whereas the fact is that she has already killed democracy in West Bengal.
The other statement she makes is she is sitting on a dharna to save the Constitution of India, but the fact is that she is trying to save her favourite police officers and Trinamool Congress politicians from the CBI.
The people of Bengal know that TMC leaders are corrupt and they were wondering why the CBI was not investigating them in the chit fund scam.
Since the CBI is taking against these corrupt politicians, the people of Bengal are happy.
Did CBI officials go to Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar's home to arrest him? Did they have the required documents to question Kumar?
Who said the CBI went to arrest the Kolkata police commissioner?
These are lies spread by Mamata Banerjee.
The CBI had gone to ask him some questions regarding the chit fund scam.
The police commissioner was sent a notice three times by the CBI to come to their office to answer some questions in the scam.
But he did not go and meet the CBI on Mamata Banerjee's instructions.
So what option did the CBI have?
They went to his house to question him.
When they (the CBI) are doing it, they (the TMC) say the CBI has no right to question the commissioner of police.
Is West Bengal not a part of India?
It is said the BJP is targeting the Mamata Banerjee government and its officers because she denied permission for BJP rallies.
There is no truth in these false allegations.
The CBI inquiry is going on the instructions of the Supreme Court.
This is going on for the last four years.
(Rashtriya Janata Dal chief) Lalu Yadav is in jail because of the CBI.
(The late Tamil Nadu chief minister) Jayalalithaa too was in jail.
Even Amit Shah went to the jail because of the CBI.
The same CBI even interrogated Narendra Modi when he was chief minister of Gujarat and he cooperated in the investigations.
But here Mamata Banerjee is taking out a morcha.
Opposition leaders claim that the BJP is intentionally targeting Mamata Banerjee as she successfully brought 20 anti-BJP leaders on one stage at the mega rally on January 19.
This has nothing to do with the Opposition rally.
Rajeev Kumar was the head while investigating the chit scams.
Since he did not cooperate, the CBI went to his home to ask questions.
It is their right to do so.
The CBI even went after (Congress leader) P Chidambaram and asked him questions in his case.
How can a chief minister of a state reach an officer's home and arrest CBI officers?
What kind of rule is this?
Now it has turned into a Centre versus state face-off.
It is not against any minister, but against an officer.
She (Mamata Banerjee) is trying to save him.
She is worried that ab kaan pakda hai, bahut jald sar bhi aa jayega haath mein (the small fry have been caught, soon the big fish too will be caught).
Rajeev Kumar was heading this chit scam investigation which was leading nowhere.
When people went to the Supreme Court demanding a CBI inquiry, it was granted by the court.
When the CBI was asking for files of the case, Rajeev Kumar has been making them run from pillar to post for more than a year and not giving them the files.
Supreme Court ne bhi Rajeev Kumar ko phatkara iss barey mein (even the Supreme Court has reprimanded Rajeev Kumar in the matter).
Files relating to chit fund scams are missing because of Rajeev Kumar, and Mamata Banerjee is supporting him.
The people of West Bengal are seeing all this.
People have come out on the roads to support Mamata Banerjee.
The people of Bengal want the Supreme Court order to be followed.
15 lakh people lost money in the chit fund scam.
Rs 80,000 crore has disappeared.
These officers who are close to Mamata Banerjee are protecting scamsters.
TMC MPs and MLAs have gone to jail in this case.
The Saradha scam was too exposed.
Therefore, the TMC now wants to target the CBI.
Isn't the timing of the CBI's action against Rajeev Kumar questionable?
Who took action against Lalu Yadav?
Did the BJP do it? No. The action was taken by the CBI when the BJP was not ruling at the Centre.
The same was with Jayalalitha's case.
When the CBI took action against Amit Shah he went to jail. The BJP did not begin a morcha and soon the truth came out.
If Mamata Banerjee's team is so clean, then let them face the charges in court and come out clean.
She is not allowing that to happen.
Mamata is on a dharna because daal mein kuch kaala hai (there is something fishy).",04 Feb 2019,2019-02-04 00:00:00,rediff

Leading in at least 30 of the 40 seats in Bihar, NDA is emerging to be the biggest force in the state dwarfing JD-U by a mile that was leading only at two seats as of this reporting while Lalu Prasad Yadav-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) was leading at eight seats.
At the time of reporting, the BJP had either won or was leading in
Ara - Raj Kumar Singh

Another new entrant to the NDA, Upendra Kushwaha led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) had either won or was leading in
Jehanabad - Dr. Arun Kumar
Karakat - Upendra Kushwaha
Sitamarhi - Ram Kumar Sharma
Meanwhile, Lalu Prasad Yadav led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) who had just two days ago claimed that his party was going to win at all 40 seats in Bihar, was leading at four seats with two of its most-anticipated candidates losing to their BJP counterparts.
Yadav's wife and former Chief Minister of Bihar Rabri Devi was well behind Rajiv Pratap Rudy in Saran while their daughter Misa Bharti was trailing Ram Kripal Yadav who just a couple of months ago, quit RJD and joined the BJP after the party president failed to nominate him preferring his daughter over him. At the last count, RJD candidates in lead were:
Araria - Taslimuddin
Banka - Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav
Madhepura - Pappu Yadav
Madhubani - Abdul Bari Siddiqui
However, the biggest loser appears to be none other than Nitish-led JD-U whose candidates were leading at two constituencies only.
While Kaushalendra Kumar was leading at the home turf of Nitish Kumar in Nalanda, the only other candidate in lead was Purnia's Santosh Kumar. Major names like Lallan Singh and Uday Narayan Chowdhary were poised to lose their bids for the Lok Sabha seats.
Nationally, the NDA was standing tall with 339 seats in its pocket while Congress was handed over the biggest defeat ever with it leading or winning at only 58 seats out of a total of 543 seats.
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Arvind Kejriwal had either won or was leading at four seats only while failing to open its account in Delhi where it had secured convincing victory during the last Assembly polls.",05 May 2019,2019-05-05 17:57:08,patnadaily
A Village in Muzaffarnagar Recounts Rapes and Murder,A Village in Muzaffarnagar Recounts Rapes and Murder,https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/a-village-in-muzaffarnagar-recounts-rapes-and-murder/,en,"Photo
KANDHLA and LISARH, Uttar Pradesh—More than three weeks after deadly sectarian violence broke out in the Muzaffarnagar district of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, cases of sexual violence against women during the rioting are beginning to surface. Only five such complaints have been taken up by the police so far.
“Three cases of rape and two cases of molestation from Fugana village are being investigated. We received information about these just two days ago,” said Kalpana Saxena, a superintendent of the police in Muzaffarnagar district, in a phone interview on Sunday.
“Two hundred F.I.R.s have been filed and 800 people have been arrested, mostly on charges of murder, arson and loot,” she said, referring to first information reports, or police complaints. Since the riots began on Sept.7, 49 people have died and 42,000 have been displaced, according to official statistics. The displaced include Mohammad Yamin, 55, who sold iron gates in Lisarh village, 75 miles north of New Delhi, and his family.
Mr. Yamin, who lived with his wife, four sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren in Lisarh, was among the estimated 2,000 Muslims who had lived side by side with the Hindu Jat community for decades. The Jats, a dominant caste in the village of 12,500 people, owned the land. The Muslims worked as laborers or ran small businesses.
As the violence escalated in Lisarh, on the night of Sept. 7, Mr. Yamin and his wife stayed behind as the rest of his family left the village to find shelter and safety in the nearby town of Kandhla.
The next morning, Mr. Yamin rode out of Lisarh to join his children in a refugee camp in Kandhla. His wife refused to accompany him. “She insisted on staying behind. She told me things will calm down in a couple days,” he said. She wanted to watch over the house, guard the jewelry and four boxes full of valuables, including three that their three daughters-in-law had brought in marriage and the things they had been collecting for their 15-year-old granddaughter’s trousseau.
Around 11 a.m., Mr. Yamin spoke to his wife on the phone from the Kandhla refugee camp, where he now lives. “She told me everything was all right,” he recalled during an interview.
A little later, his phone rang again. A neighbor, who lived in a house adjacent to his, called to say that a group of men armed with guns, sickles and swords had surrounded Mr. Yamin’s house. His wife was inside. Alone.
“How could I have gone back to rescue her with those armed men waiting at my door?” he added in a soft, defeated voice.
Two neighbors witnessed from the adjacent house what happened after the armed mob circled Mr. Yamin’s house. Baldhari, a mason, and his brother, Naresh, both from the Jat community and who go by their first names in the village, narrated the horrors of the killing of Mrs. Yamin to her husband.
“When she saw the attackers coming, she tried to climb a stairway to seek refuge in the house next door,” Mr. Yamin recounted what his neighbors told him. She had polio and diabetes, and the two conditions made movement difficult and slow for her.
“They dragged her down, violated her and burned her alive inside,” he said. As he spoke, he held his head low and crushed a tiny twig between his fingers.
One of his four sons returned to visit their house in Lisarh the next morning. He found cinders. There was no sign of his mother’s body. His father’s shop was burned, too. The family has filed a complaint with the police in the Kandhla police station.
Lisarh and the villages of Kutba, Kutbi, Lank and Bahawari were among the villages worst affected by the violence in Muzaffarnagar. Most of those who fled their homes fearing for their lives were Muslims. They sought refuge in makeshift camps, 39 of which are spread across Muzaffarnagar and a few in the neighboring Shamli district.
Multiple narratives have emerged about the origins of the riots, but the common thread is three killings in Kawal village of Muzaffarnagar district on Aug. 27. One account states that two Jat men killed a Muslim man who allegedly stalked their female relative. The slain man’s family retaliated by killing two Jat men. Another version maintains that the killings followed a dispute that erupted when the motorbikes of a Jat man and a Muslim man collided.
Tensions rose in the area after the three deaths. On the morning of Sept. 7, thousands of Jat farmers returned from a council meeting held near Kawal village, which was attended by local politicians and community leaders, and violent clashes between the two communities followed.
Noor Saleem Rana, a legislator of the Bahujan Samaj Party, and Sangeet Singh Som and Suresh Rana, two legislators of the Bharatiya Janata Party, were arrested for allegedly making inflammatory speeches. Uttar Pradesh police officials said that they are still investigating the exact sequence of events that led to the rioting. The police and the Indian army were able to control the violence after a few days.
The social stigma attached to rape, especially in rural India, has kept the victims and their families from reporting sexual violence during the riots. In a house near the Kandhla camp, a mother of five girls spoke about it in hushed tones, insisting that her identity be protected.
The woman from Lisarh village, who wore a salwar kameez, covered her head and most of her face with her dupatta, a traditional scarf, except her dark, kohl-lined and moist eyes.
On Sept. 7 around 10 p.m., a group of 10 to 12 armed men raided her house. She was inside with her children when the armed men held a gun to her husband’s chest as he was lying on a string cot in the courtyard.
The attackers entered the house and dragged the women by their hair. “I started crying,” she said. The family ran outside the house, but two of her daughters, aged 17 and 18, went missing for hours. A community member found them on a village street.
“My daughters had a fever for several days. They told me what had been done to them,” she said in a withered voice. “They were undressed and beaten on the chest repeatedly. They raped my daughters.
“I had no money to take them to a doctor,” she said.
She broke down as she mentioned that both the daughters had been engaged. One of the fiancés broke the engagement after he heard the girl had been raped. She feared that her other daughter could also meet the same fate.
“How will my daughters get married now?” she said.
Her husband, a mason, had suffered a heart attack recently, and ever since the family has had no steady source of income. Over the years, the mother had collected jewelry for her daughters’ marriage, which was left behind in the house when they fled. And the attackers burned their house.
“I had kept 15-16 things for each of my daughters,” she said. “Gold earrings, silver bangles, toe-rings, anklets, locket, necklace,” she counted as she gestured with her hands where each piece of jewelry is worn.
“I can’t afford to give them anything now,” she said. “I will have to beg.”
Victims of the violence said repeated phone calls for help from the local police station in Fugana, which is only a short distance away, went unanswered. Yet in the mayhem, tales of humanity and courage emerged. Nafisa, 50, another woman from Lisarh was in her house with her husband, her brother-in-law and his wife on the night of Sept. 7. The younger members of their family had left earlier.
“I felt the young women were under threat, but there was no reason for me to worry,” said Ms. Nafisa, who uses only one name.

At night they heard announcements on loudspeakers, which she alleges were made at the behest of Ajeet Singh, the village chief and another man who is a leader of a khap panchayat, an unelected, all-male council that dominates many rural regions of the state.
“Hindus get together and kill them,” Ms. Nafisa recalled a voice saying on a loudspeaker. “I held my slippers in one hand, kept my mobile phone on silent mode and we ran toward the sugar cane fields near my house,” she said.
One of her Jat neighbors, known as “Babloo,” who owned a dairy and supplied milk to some houses in the village, came to their rescue. He took Ms. Nafisa and her family in his car and drove them to safety to a refugee camp. Babloo, according to her, had saved about 150 Muslims of his village, ferrying them in his car. “Had it not been for Babloo, I would have been dead,” she said.
The village of Lisarh is ringed by canebrakes, poplars and lush green vegetation. Spacious houses, painted in bright colors and fitted with massive metal gates, decorated the meandering lane leading to the village. Wooden carts lay in several courtyards, and buffaloes filled their animal sheds. These were houses mostly owned by Jats, and none of those bore any signs of arson.
Ajeet Singh, 32, who has been the village chief for three years, sat on a cane chair in the shade of a neem tree in the roomy courtyard of his house, which had peach walls. A group of village elders smoked bidis on two string cots.
Mr. Singh denied any involvement in arson, vandalism, killings or rape reported from his village.
“I have heard newspapers are reporting that I am being accused,” said Mr. Singh, a tall man, who wore a white kurta pajama and a pair of black slippers. “But I don’t know what the charges are,” he said.
“No one was murdered in our village,” he said. “No one misbehaved with the women of our village. It must have happened in other villages.”
About 150 Muslim families lived in Lisarh, according to Mr. Singh. “Some left on the seventh, some later,” he said, while fiddling with his mobile phone.
He said he sheltered several Muslims in his house and made calls to the police and the army to stop the violence. He also contended that the Muslims left Lisarh after a rumor spread that the Jats returning from the Sept. 7 grand village council had killed some Muslims on their way back. “I did not attend that meeting,” he said. “I don’t know what happened there.”
Mr. Singh added that a mob had descended upon Lisarh in farm tractors and was responsible for the looting and arson. “I don’t know who these people were,” he said. “Some of them must have been Jats from our village, but I don’t know them.”
However, he suggested that some Muslims burned their own power looms and others torched their own houses to get compensation from the Uttar Pradesh government.
A few minutes’ walk from Mr. Singh’s house is a row of village shops. The only store that had been burned belonged to a Muslim vegetable vendor. A little ahead stood a house with charred doors and windows. The ceilings in most of its rooms had crumbled. Stray dogs foraged through a pile of clothes on the floor in a room. Fire had singed the steel bowls on a metal rack to pitch black.
A plaque by the burned facade bore a Muslim name: Yaseen Mohammed. Police officials said that 200 houses had been burned in Muzaffarnagar district.
Two weeks after the violence began, Yasin, 39, a Muslim man, who practiced Ayurvedic medicine in Lisarh, returned home from a refugee camp to look for some important documents. A group of people visiting from Delhi accompanied him. His house had been burned, but he managed to salvage some documents beneath a box.
Mr. Yasin, who uses only one name, recalled that some of his neighbors acknowledged him. “Others did not bother,” he said. He returned to the refugee camp.",30 Sep 2013,2013-09-30 14:23:47,india.blogs.nytimes

Priyanka Gandhi kicks off India campaign with massive roadshow,Priyanka Gandhi kicks off India campaign with massive roadshow,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47195157,en,"Image caption Priyanka Gandhi arrived in Lucknow to cheering supporters
Thousands of Indians thronged the streets to greet Priyanka Gandhi as she made her first public appearance after formally joining politics last month.
She arrived with her brother, main opposition Congress party president Rahul Gandhi, in the northern city of Lucknow to cheering supporters.
Analysts say she will infuse fresh energy into the Congress campaign ahead of general elections due this summer.
She has been likened to former PM Indira Gandhi, her grandmother.
The BBC's Geeta Pandey, who is at the roadshow in Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh state, said slogans of ""long live Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi"" greeted the two politicians. Tens of thousands of people have come out on to the streets to cheer them on.
They were accompanied by Jyotiraditya Scindia, the general secretary for Uttar Pradesh West, and were surrounded by special security forces.

Many Indians, including those at the Lucknow event, are excited about what her entry into politics will mean for Congress.
""The party workers and supporters are charged up. They are talking about the party winning the elections and ousting Mr Modi to form the next government,"" our correspondent added.
Ms Gandhi has always been considered the more popular of the Gandhi siblings, with many blaming the ""lacklustre leadership"" of her brother for a string of Congress state election defeats between 2014 and 2018.

Although she has campaigned extensively for her brother and mother, Sonia Gandhi, in earlier elections, Priyanka had refused a formal political role for herself.
But she was appointed the party general secretary for the eastern part of the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh on 23 January.
The party has gained some ground in recent state elections and Mr Gandhi's stock has risen, but Congress still faces a tough challenge to beat the BJP and regain power.",11 Feb 2019,2019-02-11 10:43:56,bbc

Fadnavis spoke to Hazare over the phone urging him to give up his fast, though the 81-year-old crusader was adamant on going ahead. Hazare also threatened to return his Padma Vibhushan award if the government does not consider his demands about the appointment of Lokpal, strengthening Lokayukta and higher rates for farmers’ produce.
Girish Mahajan, a minister in Fadnavis government, who visited Ralegan Siddhi, the native place of Hazare, said the chief minister has accepted Hazare’s demand about constituting a joint committee to make amendments in 1971 Lokayukta Act, which Hazare wants to strengthen.
Mahajan held closed-door talks with Hazare for an hour and urged him to break his fast claiming that most of the demands by the crusader are either fulfilled or under consideration.
“Appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta are two key demands of Hazare. Today, even the chief minister spoke to Hazare and accepted his demand of a Lokayukta,” said Mahajan after the meeting. The minister said he will once against visit Ralegan Siddhi on Monday, where Hazare has undertaken the fast.
Meanwhile, Hazare’s weight went down by four kilograms while his blood pressure reported rise throughout the day, according to doctors treating him.
Congress member and opposition leader in state assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil also visited Anna Hazare at Ralegan Siddhi and extended his support to the strike. Vikhe Patil said, “Last time, BJP got benefits from Anna’s strike but the saffron party has forgotten the crusader today.”
Earlier in March 2018, Hazare ended his fast at Delhi’s Ramlila ground on the seventh day of the strike after the government assured the crusader that his demands will be considered by the Centre. Hazare has undertaken 12 indefinite strikes calling it a part of his crusade against corruption.
Legal notice against NCP leader
Social activist Anna Hazare on Sunday served a legal notice to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) spokesperson Nawab Malik, who accused Anna Hazare of taking money from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for sitting on fast. Earlier last week, Malik had said Hazare takes money from advocates and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Responding to Malik’s allegations, Hazare said former should prove his remarks with evidence.
“If a senior leader of some political party (Nawab Malik) says that I have taken money from someone to sit on a hunger strike, then he should explain from where I took the money. I have asked my workers to file a defamation suit against him,” said Hazare.
In the notice sent by Hazare’s counsel advocate Milind Pawar, the NCP spokesperson has been asked to tender an apology, failing which a police case will be filed against him.
After Malik’s remarks, senior NCP leader and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar expressed regret about the accusations though Hazare refused to budge.

18:06 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee attends rally after 3 years: Ailing former West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Sunday attended a Left Front rally at Brigade Parade Ground, making a public appearance after a gap of almost three years.
Left Front chairman Biman Bose announced Bhattacharjee's presence in the rally but said that he would hear the proceedings of the public meeting from inside his car due to ill health.
Bhattacharjee left the venue after some time, but his wife Mira Bhattacharjee stayed back.
The veteran Communist Party of India-Marxist leader, who was at the helm of the Left Front government in the state from 2000 to 2011, is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been confined to his home for several months.

17:36 Govt's move over excess land in Ayodhya 'historic': Shah: Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah on Sunday described as 'historic' the Modi government's move to return the excess land around the disputed site in Ayodhya to their owners, including the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, and asked opposition parties not to put obstacles in the Ram temple issue's resolution.
Asked about the Ram temple issue at an event in New Delhi, he told reporters that his party wants a grand temple of Lord Ram to be built at the very site, where he is believed to have born, in Ayodhya at the earliest and dared opposition parties to make their stand clear on the issue.
He said the central government's plea in the Supreme Court to return the land is 'historic'.
It is believed that the return of the land -- if allowed by the court -- is likely to result in the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, which is dedicated to the construction of the temple, starting work on building it, giving a political boost to the BJP ahead of the parliamentary election as it has long championed the cause.
Opposition parties should not put obstacles, Shah added, an apparent reference to the matter pending before the apex court.
The BJP has often accused the Congress of using various ploys to delay the judicial resolution.
Asked if he believed that the input subsidy for farmers announced by the government is better than farm loan waiver, he answered in the affirmative.
The government has announced an annual cash transfer of Rs 6,000 to farmers, a move which will benefit 13-15 crore peasants.
Shah said this scheme will help all farmers every year while a loan waiver programme helps those who took money from banks and does it only once. Almost 60 per cent of farmers do not take loan, he added.
To a question about whether the BJP will go for holding assembly elections in states like Haryana and Maharashtra along with the parliamentary election, he said it is for the two state governments to decide. -- PTI
16:42 Shiv Sena extends support to Anna Hazare: Shiv Sena on Sunday extended support to veteran social activist Anna Hazare, who is on the fourth day of indefinite hunger strike at his village Ralegan-Siddhi, demanding for setting up of a Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in states.
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government at the Centre to fulfil the demands of the 81-year-old crusading activist.
""If the government will not listen to Anna, we will not leave any stones unturned to help him,"" the Shiv Sena chief told reporters in Mumbai.
He also reminded the Centre about activists who had died pushing social justice agendas in the past.
""Professor Agrawal died in Haridwar while fasting for clean Ganga and government didn't listen to him. It is the fifth day of Anna's fast and the government is not paying any heed to his demands,"" Thackeray said.
Under the banner of 'Jan Andolan Satyagraha', the social activist Hazare launched his indefinite hunger strike on January 30 to demand the setting up of a Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in states as the Narendra Modi government 'had failed' to set up the anti-corruption bodies. -- ANI

Later, the party leaders apologised to journalists protesting at the venue, he said, adding that BJP's state president would look into the incident. -- PTI

I will sent the guidelines to the state governments today only asking them to give the list and Aadhaar number of the beneficiaries so that the first installment would reach the farmers at earliest,"" said Modi. -- ANI
11:26 People will hold PM responsible if anything happens to me: Anna: Anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare, who is on the fourth day of indefinite hunger strike, said people will hold Prime Minister Narendra Modi responsible if anything were to happen to him.
Speaking to ANI, 81-year-old Hazare said, ""People will remember me as a person who tackled situations and not as somebody who added fuel to the fire. If something happened to me, people will hold prime minister responsible.""
Under the banner of 'Jan Andolan Satyagraha', the social activist launched his indefinite hunger strike on January 30 at his village Ralegan-Siddhi to demand the setting up of a Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in states as the Narendra Modi government 'had failed' to set up the anti-corruption bodies.
""Through Lokpal, even the Prime Minister can be investigated if people will give any evidence against him... Similarly, in Lokayukta a Chief Minister and all ministers and MLAs under him can be investigated if somebody gives any evidence against them.
""That's why they don't want it. No party wants it. Lokpal was passed in the Parliament in 2013, but the government is yet to appoint it,"" Hazare had said earlier. -- ANI
10:42 Shukla first officer from MP cadre to be appointed CBI chief: New CBI Director Rishi Kumar Shukla is the first officer from the Madhya Pradesh cadre to be appointed to the coveted post, officials said. Fifty-eight-year-old Shukla, a 1983-batch IPS officer who had served as the Madhya Pradesh Police chief for nearly two-and-a-half years, was on Saturday appointed the chief of the Central Bureau of Investigation, established in its current form in 1963. The founder-director of the agency, D P Kohli, an IPS of Uttar Pradesh cadre, had served as Inspector General of Police of Madhya Bharat, which later emerged as Madhya Pradesh after being merged with Vidhya Pradesh and Bhopal states.
Shukla is known for ensuring quick investigations into cases of rape in the state during his tenure as the police chief, leading to a substantial decrease in such a heinous crime. A post-graduate in Philosophy and a native of Gwalior, Shukla ensured that charge sheets in criminal cases were filed at the earliest to ensure timely start of trial so that delay in delivery of justice could be minimised, they said. Although he has not served in the CBI, he was in the Intelligence Bureau where he handled several sensitive matters, they said. After passing out from the National Police Academy, Shukla served in Raipur, Damoh, Shivpuri and Mandsaur districts in different capacities, before taking over as DGP. He was recently transferred from the post of DGP to the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation in Bhopal as chairman. He underwent training in the USA for crisis management and hostage negotiations, besides another stint of training in London, they said. Shukla was appointed the CBI Director for a fixed tenure of two years. Shukla takes charge of the country's premier investigation agency at a time it has been grappled with controversies.

10:24 Greenpeace India shuts 2 offices, cuts staff after donations row: Environmental group Greenpeace said it had been forced to shut two of its regional offices in India and had asked many staff to leave due to a block on its bank account after accusations of illegal donations.
Prime Minister Narendra Modis government has tightened scrutiny of non-profit groups over the past four years. It says they often act against Indias interests and has revoked licences for thousands of foreign-funded groups.
Known for its campaigns against Indias coal-fired power plants, Greenpeace has been barred from receiving foreign donations since 2015. Indias financial crime investigating agency froze the groups main bank account on October 5.
On Saturday, the group said 40 of its 60 India staff positions had been made redundant. Two of its regional offices -- in the capital city of New Delhi and Patna -- have been shut, it said in a statement.
Greenpeace staff across New Delhi and Patna, as well as in Bengaluru, were committed to work as volunteers, the group said.
The government can only freeze our accounts and shut our offices but Greenpeace is an idea that can never be extinguished, it said.
Since Modi took office in 2014, India has cancelled the registrations of nearly 15,000 non-governmental groups under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act.

09:34 'Heard loud bang in dark, fell from berth': Passenger of derailed train: Passengers in the Delhi-bound Seemanchal Express whose eleven coaches derailed in Bihar this morning say they heard a loud bang, as the bogies jumped from the tracks, before they were thrown off their berths violently. Many of the passengers were sleeping when the coaches derailed minutes before 4 am in Bihar's Vaishali district, 30 km from Patna. Six people were killed and 24 were injured.
""I heard a loud bang and fell on the floor of the coach. It was very dark, I couldn't see anything, felt broken glass everywhere,"" a passenger who survived the train accident told NDTV. ""I lifted my father on my shoulders and made him crawl out of the broken window,"" said the passenger who was going to Prayagraj with his family.
Officials said the coaches separated from the engine before they derailed; three of the coaches overturned completely. Personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had to climb on them and break the hardened glass of the AC coaches and cut through the iron grills of the sleeper coaches to reach trapped passengers.
The injured passengers have been admitted to a nearby hospital.
The office of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said the ministry is in touch with the Railway Board members and the authorities of the East Central Railway to find out what led the coaches to derail. The train was reportedly not running in full speed when the accident happened.
Goyal and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar gave their condolences over the deaths and wished speedy recovery to those injured.
All passenger trains on this line have been cancelled.
08:43 Carved stone pillar at UNESCO world heritage site damaged: A carved stone pillar at the UNESCO world heritage site at Hampi in Karnataka was allegedly damaged by miscreants and a video of it has gone viral. Following the incident, state Water Resources Minister D K Shivakumar said stringent action would be taken against those responsible. The clip shows three men pushing the artistically carved stone pillar to the ground, following which it breaks and the trio rejoice. Other damaged pillars are also shown lying around, but it was not immediately clear whether the men had damaged it. In a statement, Shivakumar, also the district in-charge Minister of Ballari under which Hampi falls, said he has directed police to trace the culprits and initiate action. ""We will not tolerate any such act of causing damage to historical sites,"" he said. Police said they were verifying the authenticity of the video and have begun investigations. Locals staged a protest, demanding that adequate security be provided to the monuments. Recently, the erstwhile capital of Vijayanagar empire -- Hampi -- known for its rich architecture, was listed second on the New York Times list of 52 must-go sites in the world.

Patiala, February 28
Two contractual nurses jumped from the roof of Government Rajindra Hospital this evening, sustaining serious injuries. They had been protesting atop the building for the past 23 days. Sources said one of them was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
They added that Majnu, a Class IV employee, also fractured his leg as one of the nurses fell on him. The police and officials from the district administration reached the spot to take stock of the situation.
The women have been identified as Karamjit Kaur Aulakh (37), president, Punjab Contractual and Ancillary Staff Union, and Baljit Kaur Khalsa (35). Karamjit had jumped into the Bhakhra canal over the same issue in 2016.
They had climbed atop the hospital building on February 7, demanding the regularisation of their services.
While the extent of the injuries is yet to be confirmed, Jasmeet Kaur, one of the contractual nurses, said their condition was serious. She said, “We were assured of a meeting with the Chief Minister in Chandigarh today. Instead, our six representatives met Health and Family Welfare Minister Brahm Mohindra. The meeting remained inconclusive as the minister gave only verbal assurances.”
Sukhpal Singh Khaira, leader of the Punjab Ekta Party, condemned the state government over the issue. He said, “The government has turned a blind eye towards the legitimate demands of the nurses, forcing them to jump from the roof of the hospital. The Chief Minister has failed to prevent such an incident in his hometown.”
Kumar Amit, Deputy Commissioner (DC), and Mandeep Singh Sidhu, SSP, reached the spot. The DC said, “The administration had fixed a net and spread mattresses to prevent any injury to them in case they jumped from the roof. We had requested them to get the matter resolved through talks, but they remained steadfast. Doctors are looking after them.”",20 Mar 2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

In Faridkot, farmers from several villages of Sadiq block, who own less than 5 acres of land, said they were shocked not to see their names in the lists posted by the administration in their villages for social audit.
Farmers of Ramiana village of Jaitu alleged favouritism after the names of co-operative society secretary Pirthipal Singh and his nephew were included in the loan waiver list. They staged a protest and locked the society office.
Jaitu SDM Mandeep Kaur said the list has been put on hold. She directed the naib tehsildar to visit the village to check the objections.
They said the officials who prepared the list were hand in glove with big farmers whose names were included in the loan waiver list. They said some big farmers, who own land at more than one place, are getting loan waiver by hiding their land records in connivance with the officials.
The names of nine small farmers from Rupainwala village were not in the list. Faridkot sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Gurjit Singh said the government has issued guidelines to make people aware that loan of the remaining farmers will be waived off in the next phase.
In Barnala, the farmers staged a dharna in the district administrative complex, saying while names of those owning over 5 acres were included, small and marginal farmers were left out. Deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said, “We will recheck the claims of farmers and if any patwari is found to have deliberately included names of ineligible beneficiaries we shall charge-sheet them.”
In Bathinda, farmers under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU Ekta Ugrahan) staged a protest at the agriculture cooperative society office.
A delegation of farmers from Nathpura and Burj Dalla villages met deputy commissioner Diprava Lakra alleging that eligible farmers have been knocked out of the list.

With chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh going to launch the debt-waiver scheme in Mansa by distributing certificates to eligible farmers on Monday, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) is planning to hold a protest to highlight the anomalies in the list of beneficiaries prepared by the district administration.
The union members have also decided to show black flags to the CM during his visit to Mansa.
The union’s district president Ram Singh Bhaini Bagha said that the CM has gone back on his poll promise of full debt waiver to farmers.

Hoshiarpur, February 27
Members of an NGO, Safal Bharat Guru Prampara, under the banner of the Save Water-Save Punjab Struggle Committee on Wednesday sat on a dharna against a Coca-Cola factory set up on Una Road here.
The NGO members said they continue their dharna till the factory was closed. They also threatened to take their protest to other parts of the state to save the water of Punjab.
NGO member Veer Pratap Rana said due to political and personal interests, politicians were not seen to be affected by factories and problems caused by them.
He said, “The government machinery is a puppet in the hands of politicians. On the one hand the Chief Minister himself is expressing concern over the possibility of a desert-like situation in Punjab in the next 20 years while on the other, factories are being setup by Coca-Cola, which is nothing more than an open invitation to a disastrous situation. These kind of factories are a serious threat to the already depleting underground water table in the state.” The protestors said, “Instead of a soft drink unit, if a making-juice unit is setup here, we will support the government and administration.”",28 Feb 2019,2019-02-28 08:20:00,tribuneindia

Sukhpal Khaira inherited politics. His father Sukhjinder Singh was an Akali leader and became Education Minister but died a Congressman. Khaira started his political career as a panchayat member from Ramgarh village in Kapurthala in 1992, but rose to fame when he defeated Akali giant Bibi Jagir Kaur from Bholath in the 2007 Assembly elections. In 2017, he was elected as an AAP candidate. In an interview with The Tribune reporter Vishav Bharti, he says that he formed Punjab Ekta Party (PEP) last year with an aim to give the voters a ‘genuine regional’ party. Excerpts:
You are contesting from Bathinda. By dividing anti-Akali votes, will it not help Harsimrat Kaur Badal against whom you say is the main battle?
It is a misconception being propagated by my opponents like Bhagwant Mann. Why did he go to Jalalabad himself? To ensure Sukhbir Badal’s victory? I feel that Punjab’s politics is being controlled by two big families — Badal family and Captain Amarinder’s family. And both these families need to be challenged. That’s what I want to do by contesting from Bathinda. It is a big decision of my life. It can finish my career also. I may win or lose, but Punjab must get rid of the Badal family.
The question doesn’t even arise. Instead of going to the dera, I will go for issue-based politics which is going to be decisive in this poll.
It is a cock and bull story. Both Badal and Amarinder Singh are on the same page when it comes to hating Sukhpal Khaira.
The common perception is that the contest is going to be between the Akalis and Congress? Will your alliance not play spoilsport?
You will see the reality once the campaign builds up. It is an argument being fuelled by those who want only Badal and Captain families to rule the state. Just before the election in Pakistan, similar views were expressed that only Sharif and Bhutto families can rule Pakistan. You can see today that Imran Khan stands tall there. Punjab needs a third alternative and that is what we are trying to give.
What is the future of PEP?
After the crushing defeat of Shiromani Akali Dal, there is a huge vacuum for a genuine regional political party in Punjab. SAD got 26 per cent votes in 2014 and that was before the sacrilege incidents. It will lose more votes in this election. There is strong anti-incumbency against the Congress. We will get a major share from their votes as well. So, we are hoping that this election will be a beginning for us.",20 Mar 2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

Tribune News Service
Ludhiana, February 28
After the body of a 22-year-old youth, Amit Goyal, was recovered from the railway tracks near Sherpur, his family and relatives blocked traffic on the Jagraon bridge demanding registration of a murder case. They alleged that the Government Railway Police (GRP) conducted the post-mortem examination of the deceased without keeping the family in the loop.
The protest lasted for over an hour. The agitation was called off after the police assured the protesters that they would investigate the role of a suspect whose name was mentioned by the Amit’s family.
Sonu Goyal, brother of the deceased, said last night, his brother, along with his mother, had gone to attend a religious function at their relative’s house in Jamalpur. Leaving his mother at the function, his brother left towards Sherpur along with his friend on a scooter. They stopped the scooter on the railway tracks.
“My brother asked his friend to take the scooter and his mobile phone and hand over those to his mother as he had to go somewhere to collect payment. As my brother’s friend was about to hand over the mobile phone and the scooter keys to my mother, a message was received on my brother’s phone from an unknown number which states that he is going to die. We swung into action and started tracing my brother. We were shocked to find his body lying on the railway tracks,” said the deceased’s brother.
Yesterday, the family told the GRP that Amit did not die in a railway accident rather he was killed by a man with whose daughter he (deceased) had a love affair. They said they had also requested the police to get post-mortem conducted by a board of doctors. “However, this morning, we came to know that the police initiated the inquest proceedings under Section 174, CrPC, and they also conducted the autopsy without informing us,” alleged Amit’s brother.
Sources said the deceased had sent the SMS from an unknown person’s mobile phone and the police had traced that person for questioning.

At least 150 people gathered at Surajkund in Faridabad at 9 am on Sunday to voice their criticism of the PLPA amendment, which will open up at least 25,000 acres of PLPA-notified Aravalli land in Faridabad and Gurugram, as well as other large land parcels in Rewari, Nuh and Mahendragarh for real estate development. In total, this amounts to 60,000 acres of Aravalli or non-Aravalli PLPA land.
The site of the protest was just a few kilometres from Kant Enclave, which the apex court ruled, in September last year, to have been built on a PLPA-notified forest land in collusion with the state of Haryana. The Court also called for a demolition of the colony.
On March 1, in a hearing related to the Kant Enclave judgment, the Supreme Court stated, “In order to get rid of this order, the state of Haryana has made certain amendments in Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, by virtue of that they are permitting construction in the forest area and PLPA region also [sic].” It also warned the state government to not enact the legislation without the permission of the Court.
Jeetendra Bhadana, who runs a voluntary group called Save Aravalli, led the protest. Bhadana said that the state government should be careful to proceed with their proposal in view of the contempt of Supreme Court order.
Bhandana said that Haryana has had a poor track record of implementing past legal orders on forests, “which is why the continued citizen action is required to make sure the state takes the Supreme Court’s directions seriously this time.”
Many citizens raised the slogan of ‘No Aravalli, No Vote’, implying that they would not vote to re-elect the present government if the PLPA amendment bill isn’t rescinded.
Bhadana also called for the re-notification of lapsed PLPA protections in more than 35 villages of Gurugram and Faridabad, which the government has been reluctant to do. The apex court is set to hear the case again on March 8.

Chandrababu Naidu launched its first phase on September 11. But, water is yet to reach the crop fields in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram district owing to the inordinate delay in the commencement of the works of its distributory channels.
Though the officials cite land acquisition as the major obstacles for the works to take off, fingers are being pointed to the poor coordination between Irrigation and revenue officials, who have resorted to blame game.
The project envisages catering to the irrigation needs of ayacut in 1.24 lakh acres in 10 mandals of Vizianagaram district and seven in Srikakulam and a 117-km long canal has been planned take the waters to the backward regions in both the district to stabilise cultivation there.
The Chief Minister after dedicating the project instructed the officials to complete the distributory channel works at the earliest, mentioning that around Rs. 49 crore had been released for the land acquisition.
According to sources, officials did not have coordination at the ground level, leading to delay in acquisition of land for the distributory network. Irrigation officials say that it is not possible to provide water until acquisition of 900 acres in Srikakulam district and 200 acres land in Vizianagaram for distributory network.
Farmers of Ranasthalam mandal are reportedly demanding compensation up to Rs. 20 lakh per acre for their land abutting the NH16. It has become a major hindrance for land acquisition since the government is offering only up to Rs. 5 lakh per acre.
“We have approached revenue officials many a time, but failed to get a concrete assurance from them. We cannot dig the land until it is handed over to us,” said a senior irrigation official. On the other hand, revenue officials point fingers at their irrigation counterparts, alleging that the latter have failed to take action against the contractors who have not to complete their tasks and this is what is delaying the project.
The government started the project works in 2003 at an estimated cost of Rs. 450 crore which escalated to Rs. 775 crore by 2012 owing to the delay. A fund of Rs. 550 crore has been spent so far on the construction of Thotapalli reservoir and its main canal on a starch of 117 km.
When contacted, Srikakulam Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham said that the administration had sought the cooperation of farmers too for creation of distributor canals.
Meanwhile former MLC Gorle Haribabu Naidu said: “Water has not yet reached many villages in Ranasthalam mandal. The officials should take prior permissions from R &B, Railways and other departments to complete the land acquisition process.”

They said the “unusual practice” of transferring tahsildars to new areas would seriously affect poll-preparations and the official machinery’s functioning during the elections and counting of votes. Hence, the transfers should be revoked. They submitted a petition in this regard in the Collector’s office.",28 Feb 2019,2019-02-28 19:13:33,thehindu

Ludhiana, April 20
Infuriated over the poor condition of roads, residents of Daljeet Nagar and New Aggar Nagar along with the women members of Residents’ Welfare Society staged a protest outside the office of ward number 74 councillor. The women demanded early construction of roads. They said residents were suffering due the poor condition of roads.
They blamed ward councillor Pankaj Sharma for failing to get the roads constructed. They claimed that the councillor had promised them before MC elections that development would be assured in their area.
The welfare society members claimed the roads are not being constructed for past two years. However, the gravels were laid on the roads in the past but construction work is still pending, they said.
On the other hand, Ward Councillor Pankaj Sharma (Kaka) said, “The work is under PIDB and these works were earlier stalled. According to new guidelines of the government, the contractors were asked to get their works done and get payments. However, the contractor concerned is not resuming work in these areas.”
“There is no role of councillor in PIDB works that are being looked after by the officials concerned, while work files were cleared at Chandigarh level. However, I had assured the residents that I am making efforts to get the roads constructed at the earliest. I don’t know what was the conspiracy behind today’s protest. The fact is that around 32 km roads have been constructed in the past one month,” he said.",21 Apr 2019,2019-04-21 07:37:00,tribuneindia
Constant police presence creates fear in villagers,Constant police presence creates fear in villagers,https://www.deccanherald.com/specials/sunday-spotlight/constant-police-presence-creates-fear-in-thoothukudi-715123.html,,"Arul attended the phone call after a long ring and spoke in a muffled voice. “You can’t come to my village as there is police everywhere. There are barricades and the police don’t even allow us to live in peace,” the man in his twenties told this DH correspondent who wanted to visit A Kumarettiyapuram, the first village to erupt in protest against Sterlite Copper’s expansion plans.
And when this correspondent visited the village an hour later, he could see how true Arul’s words were — policemen in groups were sitting next to almost every shop in the tiny village which people feel is more of a hindrance for them than a help.
“They are a nuisance. They are here round the clock peeping into what we do, whom we talk and where we go. You stand here and talk to me for five minutes, one of the men in khaki would come this way pretending to take a stroll along the road,” Vellathai told DH.

She continued: “What is our crime? Opposing Sterlite Copper plant and its expansion plans as it was wrecking our lives? Is opposing a factory such big a crime that we need to be put under surveillance? Nothing can change our mind from opposing the plant. We will not budge from our stand.”
Asked about a few residents of their village changing their stand and supporting the plant, Arul alleged that they were being influenced by “external factors.” “How can they change their mind in just a few months’ time? They were with us and participated in the protests. But have now jumped to the other side of the fence,” Arul said. A majority of those residing in South Veerapandiapuram, the village next to A Kumarettiyapuram, are now in favour of re-opening the Sterlite plant.
“Yes. They are supporting the other side. Anyway, they are being influenced by contractors and lorry owners who want the plant to be opened to further their business,” another woman,
Vadivu, said.
Arul spent nearly a month in Palayamkottai Central Jail in the nearby Tirunelveli district following his arrest for his “role” in the May 22 anti-Sterlite protests that ended in bloodshed. A majority of the residents of this village are still vociferous in their opposition to the reopening of the plant and its expansion plans. The villagers began their protest in February by observing a fast and soon it was lapped by organisations that were against the factory alleging that it was responsible for much of Thoothukudi’s pollution woes – more than 20,000 people marched in the port town on March 24 and the 100th day of their protest observed on May 22 ended in mayhem.
Impact on health
Their allegation against the company is that it was polluting the groundwater and the smoke emanating from the plant was causing health problems.
Most of the villagers in A Kumarettiyapuram who spoke to DH said they were living in a state of “fear psychosis” due to police presence. “We are being constantly monitored by the police and our own villagers who are against our stand. We live in a perpetual sense of fear though eight months have passed since the bloody protests. Why can’t they allow us to lead a peaceful life?” Sundari asked.
But as you cross this village and enter South Veerapandiapuram, the pro-Sterlite voices get stronger. “I have myself submitted a petition to the district collector demanding that Sterlite Copper be opened. We need jobs,” Muthu, a resident of South Veerapandiapuram, said.
On the road leading to these villages from the Sterlite plant, Maniganesh said he was opposed to the plant, but needs a job to make both ends meet. “I feel the plant should not be opened, but a way should be found to address the employment needs of the people. We are able to breathe fresh air after a very long time,” Maniganesh said.
Samugalakshmi, a daily wage labourer in A Kumarettiyapuram, spoke as she sat cross-legged overlooking a dry water body. “We have been robbed of our water by the industries that are located in Thoothukudi,” she rued.
Sources in the district administration and police, however, deny the allegations that the men in khaki still look out for men who had allegedly indulged in violence.",27 Jan 2019,2019-01-27 00:00:00,deccanherald

Messrs Keshav Agarwal, the new firm operating the toll plaza in Surathkal since November 2018, had announced collection of toll from local vehicles from Friday.
The firm had said that it will incur a loss of ₹ 3 lakh per day if it did not collect toll from local vehicles.
Protests were held on Thursday near the Surathkal toll plaza and near the office of the Deputy Commissioner against the decision of the agency.
Convenor of Nagarika Horata Samiti, Surathkal, Muneer Katipalla, said that residents are firm on their demand for scrapping the toll plaza at Surathkal. The NHAI had decided to merge the toll plaza with the one in Hejamady and this has not been acted upon till date. “Till completion of this process, we do not want toll to be collected from local vehicles,” he said in his speech at the protest in Surathkal.
Chief Executive Officer of Panambur Beach Toursim Project Yatish Baikampady, president of Kanara Small Scale Industries Association Gaurav Hegde and others made the same demand during their protest near the office of the Deputy Commissioner.
After a meeting of Vaibhav Dange, private secretary to the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, with NHAI and other officials, Mr. Kateel told reporters here on Thurday that the Union government will take a decision in a month on closing down the toll gate at Surathkal.
“Till such time, no toll should be collected from local vehicles,” he said.
Regional Officer of NHAI, Bengaluru, R.K. Suryawanshi, said that there are complications in merging the NHAI toll plaza in Surathkal with the one in Hejmady as the two projects have been taken up by different companies.
“In the meeting on Thursday it was proposed to merge the Surathkal toll plaza with the NHAI toll plaza in Brahmarakudlu (near B.C. Road),” he added. Mr. Suryawanshi said that accordingly a proposal will be placed by the NHAI before the Union government, which will then take a decision.",01 Mar 2019,2019-03-01 00:55:30,thehindu

BENGALURU: Upset over change of shift timings, a 33-year-old BMTC bus conductor tried to kill herself by consuming poison at Sumanahalli BMTC Depot (no. 31) on Thursday.Following the incident, over 100 drivers and conductors staged a protest demanding suspension of the depot manager. Around 80 trips were also cancelled.
Jyothi, the conductor, is undergoing treatment at a hospital and her condition is said to be stable. She has been working as a BMTC conductor for the last 14 years at Sumanahalli depot for last six years. She was deputed in the first shift (6am to 1pm) all these years. It is said that the depot manager, Prashanth, had changed her shift from 8am to 8 pm from Thursday, accusing her “of not bringing revenue.”
“Jyothi had come to work for the first shift even on Thursday but the manager did not assign her duty and asked her to report for the general shift. Jyothi told him that she had a three-year-old child and requested him not to change her shift timings. However, the manager did not pay heed. After waiting for a few hours, Jyothi consumed poison in the depot around 1.30 pm. The depot staff rushed her to a nearby hospital. Other drivers and conductors boycotted work and staged a protest demanding suspension of the manager,” a conductor said. Senior BMTC officials rushed to the depot and tried to convince the agitators.
But the protesters complained that the manager was harassing them for not bringing revenue by not granting leaves and changing shifts frequently. Later, senior officials promised the leaders of the workers’ union of prompt action against the manager. Only after that did the agitators call off the protest and returned to work at 9 pm.",09 Jan 2019,2019-01-09 00:00:00,newindianexpress

Addressing the protestors, Balakrishna Shetty, labour leader, said that the amendments brought in by the Modi government to 44 labour laws were all in favour of owners. These amendments would hit the welfare of the construction workers.
The new measures would lead to the Construction Workers Act 1996 being replaced.
The role of the proposed “Advisory Board” would be limited to advising and not taking decisions as was hitherto the case.
While both organised and unorganised workers had to register their names with the new State Welfare Board, this registration was not compulsory.

Tahsildars protest mass transfer out of district,Tahsildars protest mass transfer out of district,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tahsildars-protest-mass-transfer-out-of-district/article26402312.ece,en,"The Tahsildars in Madurai district on Thursday boycotted work and staged a demonstration here in protest against their mass transfer to other districts.
Ten out of 11 Tahsildars were transferred in the district.
The demonstration, supported by Tamil Nadu Revenue Officers’ Association (TNROA), was held at the Collectorate.
Official sources said Tahsildars of 270 of 296 taluks in the State were transferred in view of coming parliamentary elections after a video-conferencing of all Collectors with the Commissioner of Revenue Administration K. Satyagopal on Wednesday.
Terming such mass transfers outside their districts as ‘unprecedented’ and ‘unwarranted,’ the protesters said it would considerably affect election work.
The transfer was done as per the instructions of the Election Commission of India (ECI) that officials in the rank of Assistant Returning Officers (AROs), Assistant Election Registration Officers (AEROs), and Nodal Officers, who were generally Tahsildars, should not be posted in the home district or places where they had served for more than three years.
However, officials pointed out that such transfers of revenue officials were always done within the district but to other Taluks or Tahsildar-level posts. “That is how it happened in the 2014 parliamentary elections. We will not be posted in the same constituency,” said M.P. Murugaiyan, one of the State secretaries of TNROA.
Arguing that revenue officials, particularly Tahsildars, were involved in a variety of election-related work apart from being AROs and AEROs and were crucial in ensuring smooth conduct of elections. Transferring them outside the district would take a toll on election work.
“The newcomers will lack local knowledge, which is crucial for election work, particularly in identifying vulnerable areas and ensuring law and order,” he pointed out.
A senior official from the district administration said all transferred Tahsildars had been asked to report at their new Taluks forthwith. Of the 10 Tahsildars transferred from Madurai district, five were shifted to Theni, three to Dindigul and two to Virudhunagar.
Sources privy to the video conferencing on Wednesday said a number of Collectors expressed concern over the transfer.
The senior official said a formal request had been made to ECI from the Revenue department to retain the Tahsildars within the district while ensuring that they would not serve in their native constituency.
Meanwhile, the Tahsildars, who boycotted work on Friday, said they would not report for duty at the transferred locations. “If the orders are not revoked within this week, we will begin sit-in protests from Monday,” Mr. Murugaiyan said.",01 Mar 2019,2019-03-01 08:28:55,thehindu

The song dates to the 1998 student-led movement against former dictator Suharto.
Robet sang it on Feb. 28 at a Jakarta protest against unresolved cases of rights abuses and plans to give jobless generals roles in the civilian bureaucracy.
National Police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo said Thursday that Robet is being investigated for hate speech and faces up to two years in prison if convicted.

Diniya from Alappuzha is one of the sacked KSRTC workers who have been protesting in front of the Secretariat seeking their reinstatement. Their two-month agitation appeared to have come to an abrupt end when the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation pulled down all makeshift protest pandals that encroached on the footpath adjoining the Secretariat.
The midnight operation of the civic body was claimed to be in view of the Attukal Pongala on Wednesday when numerous devotees are expected to occupy the footpaths to offer Pongala.
Ms. Diniya took fellow agitators and police officers by surprise when she climbed a tree in the vicinity, tied a shawl around her neck, and threatened to commit suicide by hanging herself from a branch. She was soon brought down by the Kerala Fire and Rescue Services personnel and rushed to the General Hospital.
In dire straits
She later said that she had boarded a bus from Alappuzha last night with the intention of ending her life with her family, having no other go. Ms. Diniya, who has two children, lost her husband around six months ago, her former colleagues said.
Following the incident, the agitators laid siege to one side of the MG Road, throwing traffic off gear. Although they dispersed after a short while, they said the agitation would continue until the State government met their demand.
As many as 3,861 empanelled conductors were removed from service by the public utility two months ago on the basis of a Kerala High Court order.

“Due to the wrong policies of the Central government, the labourers are forced to suffer a lot. The MGNREGA budget has been reduced. Besides, labourers have not got their pending wages for the past five months,” he said.
Kulwant Singh Hunjan of the organisation said the Punjab Government must allot plots and provide grant of Rs 3 lakh each for construction of house to homeless people.",20 Feb 2019,2019-02-20 00:00:00,tribuneindia

They were protesting against the four-year undergraduate programme that is being introduced by the university.Around 150 members of various teacher and student organisations protested at 12 Janpath as police barricaded the route to Sonia's residence at 10 Janpath where they had earlier decided to stage the protest. The protesters, comprising of members from AISF, AISA, SFI, Campus Front of India and DUTA, demanded the resignation of DU Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh, saying the shift to the four-year pattern was ""hurriedly implemented"".They also alleged that the four-year programme was against the interest of students coming from weaker section, especially those belonging to SC, ST and OBC. The protest near Sonia's residence comes after several delegations of teachers and students have raised the isssuewith Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and HRD minister Pallam Raju. ""We have met HRD minister Pallam Raju and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but did not get any favourable response from them. Now we are at the doorsteps of Sonia Gandhi,"" said Udit Raj, chairman, All India Confederation of SC/ST Organisations.Raj said, ""if Sonia too does not take any step to scrap the four year programme then we will stage an even bigger protest which can also turn violent."" The Dalit activist said students coming from weaker sections, especially those belonging to SC, ST and OBC would, face difficulties pursuing the new programme as they would not be able to meet the expenditure of an additional year. ""The four-year course will only mean that the students from the socially and economically backward classes will get marginalised. They are trying to make education elitist. Only the elite will be able to do this four-year course,"" he said.""Dinesh Singh is behaving as an autocrat and has entered into the domain of HRD ministry. Their are 600 universities in India and if every university came up with their owneducational policy then what will be the result,"" Raj alleged. Teachers from the university added that the stress on English and Mathematics in the foundation course will discourage students.They also claimed that the new structure is being adopted on the lines of American higher education system to make way for foreign universities in India. Although the protesting teachers and students were not allowed to stage their demonstration on 10 Janpath, a delegation of five members submitted a memorandum at the reception of Gandhi's residence.The new four-year undergraduate programme, to be introduced from this year's academic session, has been in controversy ever since a section of teachers and students objected to its ""hurried implantation"".

The island of Phuket, with its dramatic east and west coast clifftops, means there is an abundance of ocean-facing rooftop bars and restaurants where you can enjoy a perfectly chilled beverage while taking in the beautiful scenery.

Here is, in no particular order, our Phuket Top Ten Sunset Bars on the island of Phuket….
1 Rang Hill Restaurants
Rang Hill is a popular hangout for locals especially and located on the north side of Phuket Town. It has stunning views over island. There are a number of restaurants and bars located on the hill offering local dishes and their most famous specialty is ice coffees. The most popular at Khao Rang Breeze Restaurant and Tunk Ka.
They call it a hill, but it’s actually only 150 metres high which is not so tall at all, however the views are amazing even at the low height. There’s also an excellent viewpoint to catch your postcard view of Phuket Town and the south of the island beyond.

Court rejects challenge to Batang Toru dam,Court rejects challenge to Batang Toru dam,https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/03/04/court-rejects-challenge-to-batang-toru-dam.html,en,"The Medan State Administrative Court in North Sumatra has rejected a lawsuit filed by environmental group the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) against North Sumatra administration’s decision to issue permits for a hydropower project in the Batang Toru ecosystem.
Environmentalists and activists have urged that the project, which is costing Rp 22 trillion (US$1.5 billion), be scrapped because of its potential impact on the environment, especially on the critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans that live in and around the ecosystem.
The judges said the issuance of the permit, as well as a revised environmental impact analysis (amdal) document for the project, had passed the proper legal procedures and were in line with existing regulations.
“The judges reject every part of the plaintiff’s lawsuit,” presiding judge Jimmy C. Pardede said, reading the ruling during Monday’s hearing.
In the lawsuit, Walhi argued that the permit issuance was problematic given the lack of discussion and participation from locals, as well as potential ecological problems caused by the hydropower dam. The location of the site is also prone to earthquakes, the group argued.
During previous hearings, local residents testified in the courtroom that the company had never informed them about the project.
Judge Selvie Ruthyaroodh, however, said during Monday’s hearing that the bench regarded such testimonies as irrelevant to the case, because the residents lived in Batang Toru district rather than Marancar district, where the dam would be constructed.
Walhi lawyer Padian Adi Siregar lamented the judges’ ruling. The residents who testified, he said, would also be affected by the project, as they lived downstream of the river used by the Batang Toru hydropower plant.
The court also rejected expert testimony submitted by the plaintiff that the location of the project is on an active tectonic fault. The judges argued there were no restrictions on building a structure in the area.
Selvie added that the bench believed there had been sufficient studies on the project’s effects on animals living around the dam, including the Tapanuli orangutan, and it was satisfied mitigation measures were in place.
Walhi, however, questioned this assertion as the company had not provided such studies as evidence during the hearings.
The Tapanuli orangutans, whose frizzier coats differentiate them from their Bornean and Sumatran counterparts, are threatened by poaching and illegal logging. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has included the species on its red list, classing it ""critically endangered"" as scientists have only recorded 800 of the species living in nature.
“We will file an appeal and take any other remaining legal measures available,” Walhi’s North Sumatra office director, Dana Prima Tarigan, said. He added that the verdict did not reflect justice or fairness for the environment.
Apart from the lawsuit, Walhi was also involved in a protest on March 1 with an international network of activists against Bank of China, one of several international banks funding the project. The environmental group demanded the bank take concrete action by stopping its funding of the project because of its potential threat to the environment.
“Walhi believes this project is not in line with China’s Belt and Road Initiative promoted by President Xi Jinping, as the project won’t provide mutual benefit as promised by the Chinese government,” the group wrote in a statement.
PT NSHE senior executive for external relations, Firman Taufick, lauded the court verdict, saying the company could now focus more on the construction of the power plant. The project, which will produce 510 megawatts of electricity for North Sumatra, has been touted as “environmentally friendly”.
“PT NSHE asks for every element [of society] to support the construction of the power plant as it will provide clean electricity for the province,” Firman said in a press briefing in Medan on Monday. He also asked all experts and academics to work together with the company to draft tangible programs to conserve the Batang Toru ecosystem.",22 Oct 2018,2018-10-22 00:00:00,thejakartapost
Thousands of Muslims gather in Jakarta to pray for Indonesia,Thousands of Muslims gather in Jakarta to pray for Indonesia,https://en.antaranews.com/news/122391/thousands-of-muslims-gather-in-jakarta-to-pray-for-indonesia,,"Thousands of Muslims gather in Jakarta to pray for Indonesia
Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Thousands of Muslim worshipers gathered in the National Monument (Monas) Square here on Thursday evening to seek the mercy of almighty Allah Subhanahu Wata`ala for Indonesia ahead of this year`s general elections.
They came from Jakarta and other cities to attend the event, which was organized by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI)-Jakarta Chapter along with several other Islamic organizations, by highlighting the theme of ""212 Evening of Prayer.""
The Muslim men and women flocked to the Monas Square in Central Jakarta a few hours before the Maghrib prayer was performed in congregation.
With the guidance of ulemas sitting on a stage, the crowd started the event`s agenda by performing compulsory Maghrib (sunset) followed by Isha (evening) prayers in congregation, as well as chanting praises to Allah.
They also recited and sang ""Shalawat"" (religious chants for praising Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) in an endeavor to ""knock the gates of sky."" This religious gathering was also filled with prayer for the safety of Habib Rizieq Shihab.
Shihab is widely known as a respected ulema and the founder of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). He is currently staying in the Holy city of Mecca with his family, and the crowds of attendees prayed for his return to Indonesia.
The gathering was not only attended by ordinary Muslim worshipers but also by many influential figures in the country, including Amien Rais (one of the Reform Movement leaders), Fahri Hamzah, and Fadli Zon (outspoken legislators).
Speaker of the People`s Consultative Assembly (MPR) Zulkifli Hasan, MPR`s former speaker Hidayat Nur Wahid, FPI leader Sobri Lubis, and the daughter of Indonesia`s second president Soeharto, Titiek Soeharto were also seen among the attendees.
In his brief speech, Lubis asked the crowd to pray for the safety of several Muslim figures who remained in prison, including Buni Yani and Ahmad Dhani.
He also criticized what he called an act of injustice in law enforcement, as observed in the Habib Bahar bin Smith case.
Meanwhile, MPR Speaker Zulkifli Hasan underlined the importance of conducting fair, peaceful, and democratic parliamentary and presidential elections for Indonesia`s better future.
In securing the gathering, at least 12 thousand security personnel were deployed. They consisted of those from the Jakarta Metropolitan Police, Indonesian Military, and the Jakarta Provincial Government.

Outcry at refusal to ban toxic chemicals,Outcry at refusal to ban toxic chemicals,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1629930/outcry-at-refusal-to-ban-toxic-chemicals,,"Vegetable samples with pesticide residue are on display at an event held to promote food safety in November 2017. (Bangkok Post file photo)
Consumer groups have vowed to ramp up their campaign to force the national committee on hazardous substances to ban three hazardous farm chemicals immediately, not in another two years.
Comprising 686 civic groups, they have come together under the banner of the Thai Pesticides Alert Network (Thai-PAN). The group also comprises doctors from the Public Health Ministry and state hospitals as well as academics who are calling for a complete ban on paraquat, glyphosate and chlorpyrifos.
The network yesterday released a statement lambasting five agricultural officials, who sit on the 29-member committee, for ignoring warnings from scholars and experts about the dangers of these chemicals, especially paraquat, which continue to harm the lives of farmers, consumers and newborn babies every year.
The criticism is a response to the decision that the national committee made on Thursday rejecting rejecting calls from consumers groups, academics and official agencies, including the Ministry of Public Health, to ban the three pesticides. However, the national committee could only “promise” to put strict control on their uses until they are replaced by alternative methods, which will “hopefully” lead to their complete ban in the next two years.
The majority of committee members who voted against the ban must take responsibility for a resolution that “favours pesticide companies”, the network said in its statement, raising doubts over some members’ vested interests in the companies.
The group urged the public to share the statement and join the campaign.
“We believe in the power of people to bring about change in the future,” the network said. The statement was posted on Thai-PAN’s Facebook page yesterday, prompting people to criticise the vote on social media.
Facebook users called for the release of names of the committee members who voted against the ban.
The network vowed to spearhead the move by asking the Office of the Ombudsman to petition the National Counter Corruption Commission to look for alleged irregularities behind the decision. The network will also take the issue to the Administrative Court.
The ombudsmen, together with state and academic powerhouses like the Public Health Ministry, the National Human Rights Commission and the Medical Council of Thailand, all support a complete ban.
Abour 50 countries have banned paraquat and limited use of glyphosate and chlorpyrifos. China, a major paraquat exporter, has announced it will ban its use and export by 2020.
Thiravat Hemachudha, of Chulalongkorn University’s Faculty of Medicine, said that studies have found paraquat residuals in the bodies of farmers and their family members.
One such study by Pornpimol Kongthip, a researcher at the Faculty of Public Health, Mahidol University several years ago, showed that paraquat can be transferred from mother to foetus in the womb. In her research, 53 toddlers in Amnat Charoen, Kanchanaburi and Nakhon Sawan provinces were found to have paraquat contamination.
But despite the risk, the government does not seriously pay heed to the concerns, Mr Thiravat said.
Public Health Minister Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn said yesterday. “We have to respect the rules they [authorities] set up …, but we’ll do what we’re authorised to do.”
The fierce opposition yesterday prompted Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Grisada Boonrach to send an urgent message to senior officials asking them to “build public confidence” that the ministry is adamant about imposing a ban in with the next two years. The decision by the National Committee on Hazardous Substances not to ban paraquat over the next two years is shameful and shows a lack of responsibility. The committee on Thursday voted 16:5 in favour of continuing to allow the use of the chemical, which is prohibited in 53 countries due to its high toxicity. Five members abstained.
The voting was carried out in secret, but it is understood that those representing the Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry gave a “yes” vote to the popular herbicide.
The decision by the committee, dominated largely by officials from the ministry who are alleged to have connections with farm chemical giants, followed the same lines as previous statements made about the herbicide.
This is another example that shows the committee cares neither about the health of the people nor the environment and just wants to please the agro-giants. Thailand imported about 44,501 tonnes of paraquat last year compared with 31,525 tonnes in 2016.
In April last year, when the terms for the import of paraquat were due to expire, the committee voted for an extension. At that time, the panel insisted it still had “no knowledge how the chemical causes impacts on health and the environment”.
In May, the committee claimed, amid growing concern about the impact of the pesticide, that a ban was not possible as there were no other chemicals in the market that “work as effectively as paraquat”. The Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry pledged to train farmers how to use the herbicide “properly” to minimise any negative impacts on the health of users and consumers.
The mere fact that paraquat use requires special training is worrying. For one thing, it is questionable whether the ministry can give training to all users. It also implies that the chemical is highly hazardous while improper or excessive use of it can adversely affect users’ health.
Although paraquat is only allowed to be used in the growing of six crops, including corn, palm and rubber, it is likely, due to weak law enforcement, that the herbicide is widely used illegally with other crops. Research by Naresuan University found paraquat residue on many vegetables not on the list.
The Agriculture Ministry is at odds with the Health Ministry, which has a clear stance that the herbicide must be banned. In April 2018, a health reform committee under the ministry issued a resolution to ban the import of paraquat and chlorpyrifos by the end of last year and to prohibit all use by Dec 1 this year.
The Public Health Ministry has conducted a number of research studies, which show the impact of the herbicide on people’s health. More importantly, it found that paraquat residues had entered the food chain. These results were submitted to the National Committee on Hazardous Substances.
But the pro-paraquat officials refused to listen. They insist the ban will cause problems for many farmers who depend on it. Over the past few months, groups of farmers have come out to petition against the ban.
Corn farmers, in particular, object to a ban, which they claim will lower their yields. They also insist the herbicide has reduced their labour costs, which means lower production costs overall.
One corn farmer dismissed concerns over the chemical, saying: “Exported corn has never been returned because of the herbicide.”
But they, the farmers and the officials should know that nature has its limits and the environmental clock is ticking. If we wait until the produce is returned it will be too late, and the damage will be too great to control.",16 Feb 2019,2019-02-16 00:00:00,bangkokpost

Small groups of pro- and anti-military activists gathered in front of army headquarters on Wednesday, expressing opinions on the army chief's predilection for an anti-communist song from the mid-1970s.
Activists and police also engaged in a brief song battle.
The two groups showed up about the same time on Ratchadamnoen Avenue. Police quickly separated them and let anti-regime activists expressed their views first.
Among them, Prit Chiwarak called on army chief Gen Apirat Kongsompong to stop the playing of the song Nak Phandin (Burden on the Land) over the army's many radio outlets and at army units.
He said that the lyrics accused political opponents of undermining society.
Another anti-regime activist, Ekachai Hongkangwan loudly played the anti-regime song Prathet Ku Mee (What My Country's Got). Seconds later police countered with the national contribution song Khwam Fan An Soong Sood (Greatest Dream), played briefly and loudly on a big portable speaker.
Later a pro-military group from Thon Buri area of Bangkok took its turn. Leading the group, Bancha Panwiwat said the military protected the country and they supported the military.
About 50 police supervised the scene.
Earlier this week, Gen Apirat responded to politicians' election policies promising to cut the defence budget and end compulsory conscription by recommending they listen to the song Nak Phandin -- a right-wing anti-communist song associated with the massacre of students and activists on Oct 6, 1976.
This drew strong criticism, and demands that the army commander-in-chief stay out of politics.

SONGKHLA: The checkpoint between Thailand and Malaysia in Sadao district of this southern border province was temporarily blocked by a group of motorcycle taxi drivers, obstructing the passage of vehicles carrying tourists and cargo.
About 50 motorcycle taxi operators began to block the Thai-Malaysian border checkpoint in Sadao district at 11am to protest against Malaysia's strict inspection of documents on motorcycle taxis taking passengers from the checkpoint to a duty-free shop in Malaysia's Kedah state.
Under a new, stricter measure, drivers of motorcycle taxis from the Thai side of the border are required to carry a passport, instead of a temporary border pass as before.
The blockage halted the movement of vehicles taking tourists and cargo across the border in both directions for nearly one hour.
The protesters agreed to end the blockage after talks with immigration police, military officers and administrative officials.
However, they continued to gather near the checkpoint, calling for officials from both the Thai and Malaysian sides to ease the strict inspections.",17 Feb 2019,2019-02-17 00:00:00,bangkokpost

The Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) staged a statewide rail blockade against the “anti-Assam, anti-Northeast” bill.
Thousands of people, including students, took part in the AASU protest.
Addressing the gathering, AASU’s general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said, “The Supreme Court has been updating the National Register of Citizens to deport the country’s illegal citizens after 32 years since the Assam Accord was signed. The Centre, at the same time, is trying to pass the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019.”
“The bill was passed in the lower House and now the Centre is trying to get it passed in the Upper House, too, by hook or by crook,” he added.
The AASU leader said if the bill is passed, the people of Assam would lose their indigenous culture and identity. “Therefore, we want the bill to be scrapped immediately. We can’t take the additional burden of illegal migrants who came to Assam after March 24, 1971, and have been staying here illegally.”
He appealed to the people of Assam to vote against the BJP in the general elections. The AASU leader alleged that the BJP has lost the trust of the state’s indigenous population. He added that the Centre is trying to belittle the sacrifice of the Assam Movement’s martyrs by trying to get the bill passed.
Lurinjyoti threatened to intensify their protests until the bill is scrapped. Train services were disrupted for an hour across the state owing to the rail blockade.
At least 10 trains under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) in Assam were either detained or halted at several stations for around 20 minutes to an hour. No train was cancelled.
Vice-president of the AJYCP’s Guwahati unit Sanjib Bora said, “Our agitation against the bill will continue. We will compel the BJP government to scrap the bill.” Police detained several protesters across the city during the blockade.
NFR chief public relations officer Pranab Jyoti Sharma said, “Services were restored after the blockade was lifted.

Congress walks out of Himachal Assembly over highways,Congress walks out of Himachal Assembly over highways,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/congress-walks-out-of-himachal-assembly-over-highways/725469.html,,"Shimla, February 7
The opposition Congress on Thursday staged a walkout from the Himachal Pradesh Assembly, saying that the state's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had failed to get Rs 65,000 crore for 70 national highways sanctioned from the Centre.
After the walkout, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur blamed the previous Congress government for deliberately stalling the process for the highways for more than one year before the 2017 Assembly polls.
""The (state) Congress didn't want to give advantage to the BJP for giving in-principle approval to 70 national highways,"" he said.
Thakur said the Congress government had started the process for just eight detailed project reports (DPRs) of the highways in over one year, whereas ""our government has started the process of outsourcing for 50 DPRs"".
""It takes time for notification of the highways after in-principle approval as there are so many procedures involved,"" the Chief Minister added.
Describing the move as unfortunate, the Chief Minister said the Congress was looking for an opportunity to stage a walkout.
""The Congress wants to make a hue and cry in the run up to the Lok Sabha polls. Development is a collective programme and nobody should create hurdles in the development,"" he said.
Raising the question earlier, Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said the government had been making tall claims on the issue, but there was nothing on ground. IANS",07 Feb 2019,2019-02-07 16:11:00,tribuneindia
5 held after calling for PM to quit,5 held after calling for PM to quit,https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1622498/5-held-after-calling-for-pm-to-quit,,"Police have arrested five people who showed up at Government House to call for the prime minister's resignation.
Thanawat Wongchai, a former president of the Chulalongkorn University Student Council, Parit Chiwarak, a political science student at Thammasat University and three other pro-democracy activists tried to submit an open letter to Gen Prayut yesterday.
The letter urged him to resign as prime minister and chief of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) now that the pro-regime Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) has formally asked him to be its prime ministerial candidate in the March 24 general election.
The activists were responding to Gen Prayut's challenge for anyone to dare oust him in an emotional briefing on Friday in which he defended his decision to hold on to both positions. He later apologised for his outburst.
The activists were greeted at Gate 4 by Pol Col Somyot Udomraksasap, superintendent of Dusit police station, who explained to them that a radius of 50 metres around Government House was off-limits to demonstrators under the public assembly law.
Since Mr Parit posted a message online asking people to join him and did not inform police of the activity 24 hours in advance, he might be breaking the law, Pol Col Somyot told the group.
Mr Tanawat and Mr Parit moved to Gate 3 and read the letter, which called Gen Prayut's behaviour a risk to a free and fair election and urged him to resign as prime minister and NCPO chief as soon as he agrees to become the Palang Pracharath prime ministerial candidate.
Each party can name up to three prime ministerial candidates and all names must be submitted by Feb 8. Palang Pracharath has already named two other contenders: Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak and Uttama Savanayana, the party leader and former industry minister.
Mr Parit then hung dried chillies, salt and garlic on the fence of Government House, saying they were gifts to remind Gen Prayut that he should quit. Historically, the three ingredients were burned during rituals to curse someone.
Police then took the five to the Dusit station, where they were charged with violating Section 10 of the 2015 Public Assembly Act, punishable by a fine of up to 10,000 baht.
Pressure has mounted for the premier to resign after it became clear he would consider PPRP's offer.
On Friday, Gen Prayut claimed that ever since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, there has been no law requiring a prime minister to resign ahead of an election and none has ever done so.
Additionally, he expressed concern about who would be in charge of the preparations for the coronation of His Majesty the King in early May.
Critics say Gen Prayut should resign because he retains absolute power under Section 44 of the interim constitution over everyone, including the Election Commission.
More importantly, as the NCPO chief, he will have a major say in the appointment of all 250 senators after the election takes place. The senators, in turn, will vote to choose the prime minister along with the 500 MPs, which is seen as a blatant conflict of interest.",03 Feb 2019,2019-02-03 04:00:00,bangkokpost

The constant denial of rights compelled the employees to resort to strike in order to press for immediate action for resolution of their issues, they said adding, “Unlike employees of other departments, the field employees of Election Department sacrifice their social as well as personal lives for upholding the reputation and sanctity of the democratic processes and the Election Department but when it comes of their rights, they are constantly ignored”.
Meanwhile, the protest of field employees of Election Department was also held at Press Colony Srinagar. The protesting employees said that billions of rupees are being spent on conduct of polls or even huge salaries are paid to the deputed employees for performing one day of poll duties but on the contrary the rights of the employees of the election department are grossly violated.
They said, “Employees of the department are not paid adequate salaries and there are visible discrepancies in the salaries in comparison with the salaries of employees of election department in other states. There is no carrier advancement policy or scope of future growth to the employees in the department. The employees get stuck to their single designation for decades together”.
“The employees have been persistently pleading for resolution of issues from decades, but all the time false promises and assurance are given by the concerned authorities and with the result the employees continuously get persecuted and none of our issues are resolved,” they said and appealed Governor SP Malik to make necessary intervention for addressing the vital issues of the employees.
If all our reasonable demands are not fulfilled timely then the employees will resort to more intensive strike program from February 12, they added.",31 Jan 2019,2019-01-31 21:38:44,dailyexcelsior

The protesters were opposing the 13-point roster, which many professors claim will drastically reduce positions reserved for scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST) and other backward classes (OBC). “Under the new system, every fourth post will be reserved for OBC, every seventh for SC and 14th for ST. This means smaller departments will have effectively no reservation,” said Saikat Ghosh, an assistant professor in Delhi University (DU).
The new system, which treats each department as the unit for reservation, was ordered by Allahabad high court in 2017. The Centre filed a petition in the Supreme Court, which upheld the HC judgment last week.
On Thursday, SC/ST/OBC groups held protests in MP, Haryana, UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Kerala. “The presence of these teachers gave us confidence. Now, we will be excluded structurally,” said Komal Rajak, a PhD student.
Leaders from the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Janata Da, Aam Aadmi Party , Left parties and the Bhim Army, backed the protests. “The government is an anti-Dalit party,” said RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.
Experts said Thursday’s protests could be the making of second wave of Dalit anger because it hit three key concerns: Reservation, education and government jobs. The first wave was seen following the dilution of the SC/ST Act in April, which forced the government to undo the changes. “The Constitution is like a mother to Dalits, and education is an emotive issue because of the importance given by Ambedkar,” said Sheoraj Singh, a DU professor.
Activist Ashok Bharti warned Dalit groups will call for a bigger strike if the system was not rolled back. “The government is giving more representation to upper castes through 10% quota but failing SC/ST/OBC.”
For the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the challenge is to retain Dalit and OBC votes in the face of disappointment and a concerted campaign around reservation, said Sumeet Mhaskar, an associate professor at Jindal University. “The roster issue will add to the campaign against the BJP. The opposition will take it up in a big way because it is about government jobs and hurts OBCs as well,” he said.
The BJP has not commented but last year, HRD minister Prakash Javadekar told Parliament the government was committed to SC/ST/OBC reservations.

BENGALURU: They endured blisters on their feet and intense sunburn, but just wouldn’t give up. Over 4,000 women walked for 200km to push for a ban on liquor . On Wednesday, they ended their 11-day journey which started on January 19 from Chitradurga to Bengaluru. As they marched to Vidhana Soudha, over 200 cops stopped them at Malleswaram Grounds. Later, they were diverted to Freedom Park where they held a dharna.Though the women wanted to meet chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, he handled the situation through bureaucrats. Late Wednesday night, he said it takes time for the government to look into the demand for total prohibition. “During my last tenure as CM I had banned arrack and lottery. We cannot take a decision without consulting our alliance partner. Also, the opportunities for resource mobilisation have been limited under the GST regime. This calls for a high-level discussion. The government cannot take an immediate decision. We need time to deliberate the pros and cons,” he added.Earlier in the day, he met a delegation of protesters led by theatre activist Prasanna Heggodu and told them he’d look into the matter. Not satisfied with his assurance, protesters decided to stage a night-long dharna near Freedom Park. “The CM did not heed to our demands. We’re not moving out until he meets us,” said activist Vidhya Patil.Under the banner of Madya Nisheda Andolana, hundreds of women have been demanding prohition for the past few months. On Wednesday, many prominent persons of the city and social activists extended their support. They included anti-graft activist Ravi Krishna Reddy and theatrepersons Arundathi Nag and Prasanna.""We need to salute these women. One can feel their pain. I remember my domestic help complaining about her relatives in Bihar, but the same problem is here too,” said Arundathi Nag said.“A lot of youngesters are falling prey to liquor these days. In cities, there’s awarness about the problem but it’s less in villages,” said Prasanna.Many protesters said they’re fed up of being beaten by their drunk husbands. They sang songs, played drums and shouted slogans. At Freedom Park, women blocked roads and this resulted in traffic jams all around Majestic area.“We chose January 30 for this protest because it’s Martyrs Day, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Our aim is to remind the government that Mahatma’s wish was to see a liquor-free society. It's sad the government considers liquor a source of income, not a social evil,” said activist Papamma.The protesters are from Chitradurga, Raichur, Tumakuru, Kolar and a few other districts.Ratna Madesh, 25, a homemaker from Hiriyur of Chitradurga, never thought she had the courage to march 200km. At Freedom Park on Wednesday, she told TOI that her drunk husband had made her an activist.“I’ve been married for 10 years and my husband started drinking about nine years ago. Whenever he’s drunk, he blames me for not having children and beats me. I got fed up and left home to join the march,” she added.Shakkamma, a resident of Raichur, was married to her uncle Maltesh Goud who is 20 years older. “I was 21 years old. The marriage deal was that Maltesh would pay off our family loans. Marriage became very ugly as my husband drinks a lot. When I told my husband about the march, he threatened to kill me. But women in my neighborhood supported me and I escaped from my home to join the march,” she added.Gangamma Patil, a homemaker from Raichur, said men in cities are kinder to their partners when compared to those in rural areas. “Drunk rural men act like hooligans,” she added.During the march, Renukamma, 55, died when a speeding motorbike rider knocked her down near Kuluvanhalli, Nelamangala on January 27. She was from a village in Lingasugur taluk, Raichur.“After losing our comrade, we became more determined. Police did not provide safety measures and we lost her. We’re ready to face the wrath of the government,” Kaveramma, a farmer and Renukamma’s friend said.Asked why the women marched barefoot for such a long distance, Parvathamma Mundgoud, 35, from Hiriyur who works at a chilli processing factory, said many were uncomfortable walking with slippers. “Due to the hot road and sweat, we got blisters on our feet. The slippers would get stuck when those behind stepped on them. We decided to walk barefoot.”The women had to cope with the mercury dipping below 19 degree celsius at some places. We slept on plastic sheets and had small blankets to cover ourselves,” said activist Vidhya Patil.The women walked around 20km every day and took reaks near playgrounds, government schools and marriage halls. Some gram panchayats offered food and help.“We want to protect our families. We face discrimination and harassment at the work place and the men of our families don’t do anything about it,” said Shakkamma Goud, a weaver from Raichur.Many college girls and young professionals near Freedom Park were not only curious about the protest but also joined in. Engineering student Nimitha Mathda said: “I know many people who lost family members to liquor. This protest should be an awakening.”",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 12:05:16,timesofindia.indiatimes

Such incidents are not tolerable,” the memorandum submitted to the collector said, adding that the minority community has made its contribution to society and would continue to do so. The community’s safety has to be ensured, protesters said.Around 20 members the Yuva Sena, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena which is part of the ruling coalition in the state, stormed the Holy Cross Convent High School at Kasaba Bawada and ransacked the office of the school principal after parents were asked for an additional Rs 7,000 for each student in the junior kindergarten.There are 134 students in the school’s junior kindergarten.

Madya Nishedha Andolana is fighting for a liquor ban in Karnataka,Madya Nishedha Andolana is fighting for a liquor ban in Karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/society/battle-against-the-bottle-women-keep-up-their-fight-for-liquor-ban-in-karnataka/article26212718.ece,en,"On Gandhi’s death anniversary last month, January 30, a sea of women — around 3,000 — poured into Bengaluru at the end of a 12-day march. There were 15-year-olds, there were 60-year-olds, there were middle-aged women. They came from far and near, and they came with one aim: to seek a ban on the manufacture and sale of liquor in Karnataka. Alcohol, they said, had ruined their sons, husbands, brothers, homes, dented their earnings, and eaten into the money meant for food and education.
Armed with a cloth bundles, unmindful of the blisters that had burst on their feet, they had marched from Chitradurga and crossed many highways before reaching Bengaluru.
Long days’ journey
The women had left their homes with a plate, a glass and some clothes. Sapnadeepa, 24, from Bidar, who was among those who had started out from Chitradurga, said they had covered 15 to 20 km each day; they had camped wherever they stopped for nightfall. “We stayed in mutts, panchayat offices, and government schools. People along the way were more than generous. Some arranged food, some others medicines and sanitary napkins. They gave us waterbottles, chappals, bedsheets, sweaters, even saris,” she said.
Sapnadeepa’s 28-year-old cousin was an alcoholic who fell ill and died in 2017. “I won’t be wrong in saying there is one wine shop for each house in our village,” she said.

Unfortunately, the marchers — all members of the Madya Nishedha Andolana (movement for liquor ban) — could not meet Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and had to return empty-handed and with no assurances from the government. Their fight, however, is far from over, they say, now back home.
Bhagyamma, 30, from Davangere district, described how her father continues to battle addiction. “My father drinks his earnings away. We are four siblings; we got a bit of education with great difficulty. My mother continues to toil to repay the loans. My father ended up selling the land we owned because of his addiction. Alcohol addiction is like a virus and it has to stop. It is sad the government gave us no response, but we will not give up our fight,” she said. Similar agitations have been held by women in other States, such as Odisha and Tamil Nadu, where women and children have echoed similar concerns.
Root of distress
A 2017 report, ‘Farmer suicides — An all India study’, commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, mentions drug abuse/ alcoholic addiction as one among the “prominent causes” for farmer suicide (4.4%). The other causes are bankruptcy or indebtedness (20.6%), family problems (20.1%), farming-related issues (17.2%), and illness (13.2%).
However, many of the other causes of suicide, such as indebtedness or illness, can be connected to alcohol addiction and drug abuse. “Without exception, the victim households of all the States were honest enough to accept that victims were alcohol addicts. Therefore, rehabilitation centres for drug abuse and alcohol addiction should be established,” the report suggests.
Bihar, the dry crusader
What impact has prohibition had on States where it has been implemented? Shaibal Gupta from the think-tank Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) says that studies conducted in Bihar after prohibition concluded in

favour of it. The report by ADRI and Development Management Institute (DMI), commissioned by the Bihar government in 2018, shows a massive rise in sale of expensive saris and honey, among others, in post-ban Bihar. The studies also say that 19% of households acquired new assets from the money they would have earlier used to buy alcohol.
Women, together
The report, ‘Impact of Prohibition on Economy, Society and Family Life in Bihar,’ notes, “With adoption of Prohibition Act, 2016, Bihar has become a ‘dry crusader’. The ban in Bihar is backed by social and economic factors, and thus enjoys full support from all sections of the population, particularly the women who run the households.”
Abhay Kumar, State co-ordinator, Grameena Kooli Karmikara Sanghatane, a rural labourers’ organisation that’s spearheading the liquor ban movement in Karnataka, said that the recent padayatra was the fourth attempt in recent times in the State. “The intention was to pressurise the government and highlight the fact that women in every taluk in the State have problems. United, we could manage to do it and a big support group has been formed now. All major political parties have been told about the problem. If none of them reacts, lakhs of women will either exercise NOTA or not vote in the coming elections. Let’s see if the liquor barons in the parties are the bigger pressure group or democracy,” he said.
The problem is not specific to region or socio-economic status. According to Kumar, “You can go to any village or city. As we were passing through Tumakuru and Bengaluru, women in slums came out to ask what the padayatra was about, and started telling their own stories of how houses have been destroyed because of alcoholism. We are not asking anything new. Prohibition is stated in Article 47 of the Indian Constitution. What has been done all these years?”
The women’s frustration is tangible. But can prohibition work? Governments have usually been unable to fully control sales or consumption of alcohol even after a ban, with people crossing over to neighbouring States or drinking spurious liquor or feeding off a booming underground market as in Gujarat. Are there other ways to control alcoholism? It’s a question that doesn’t have easy answers.

The list of demands includes dropping of the new pension scheme.
The JACTTO-GEO said 90% of the 12 lakh staff participated in the strike across Tamil Nadu.
Teachers and government staff protested inside the Chennai Corporation campus. They maintained that getting the strike to a close was in the hands of the Chief Minister and ministers D. Jayakumar and Sengottaiyan. Similar protests were also seen in front of Zonal offices in Tambaram and Madhavaram.
Central region
Thousands of striking government employees and teachers were arrested across the Central region on Wednesday after they resorted to road roko agitations in support of their charter of demands in eight places in the districts. This reflected in elementary schools being closed in some parts of the region.
The participation of government employees was about 30% to 40% in Tiruchi district, claimed J. Valavan Arasu, Tiruchi district secretary, Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association. About 70%-75% of teachers continued their strike in Tiruchi district with many elementary schools remaining closed on Wednesday too, said S. Neelakandan, one of the district coordinators of JACTTO-GEO. Over 2,400 striking employees and teachers were arrested in Thanjavur district. Arrests of protesters were also made in Pudukottai, Perambalur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Ariyalur districts.
In southern Tamil Nadu, over 21,000 government employees and teachers, owing allegiance to JACTTO-GEO, were detained for participating in road roko on the second day of the indefinite strike. In all the nine districts, more women were seen in the agitation venues. JACTTO-GEO office-bearers in some districts claimed that response to the strike call had improved.
Work in some of the departments remained affected while primary and elementary schools were kept open as per instructions of the Chief Educational Officer. All the arrested employees and teachers were kept in private halls.
In Thoothukudi, DMK Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi met the agitating staff in a private hall, where they had been kept after arrest, and assured that her party, if voted to power, would concede all their demands.
In Coimbatore district, nearly 2,500 State government employees and teachers participated in road roko agitations held at nine places on Wednesday. Functioning of government offices in Erode, Salem, and Namakkal districts were affected. However, functioning of schools was not affected.
As many as 7,729 members of JACTTO-GEO were removed after they staged road roko at various places in these three districts.",24 Jan 2019,2019-01-24 01:15:50,thehindu

MUMBAI: More than a dozen assistant municipal commissioners boycott their work for a couple of hours on Monday and gathered at Worli’s G south ward office to protest against a showdown between some civic officials and MNS workers on Saturday.MNS workers had clashed with assistant municipal commissioners on Saturday when they went to the Worli ward office to complain against the licence department’s staff for not taking action against hawkers in Prabhadevi. The MNS workers claimed that the hawkers’ encroachment in the area had increased. They also said that while officials from the licence department claimed that action had been taken, none of the hawkers could produce fine receipts. On Saturday, when the MNS workers went to complain, an argument started between them and the ward office’s staff. Eventually, a police complaint had to be lodged.On Monday, around 16 assistant municipal commissioners reached the Worli ward office and said that they were extending their support towards the G-south ward officer, who was allegedly threatened by MNS workers on Saturday. The ward officers came despite it being a Monday, a day when they are expected to hold meetings to hear public grievances.“Such environment was not safe for any officer to work,” said one of the ward officers.Assistant municipal commissioner Devendra Kumar Jain said that MNS workers had also threatened civic employees constructing a public toilet at Prabhadevi railway station. “We have followed the due course of law and complained to the police,” said Jain.However, Sandeep Deshpande, MNS general secretary, said that ward officers need to first start working and then boycott work. “We have been complaining for long about hawkers encroaching several areas of Prabhadevi and that is why we were forced to approach the ward officer. We neither physically abused him nor threatened him,” he said.Deshpande held an online chat with citizens on Monday to give out details of Saturday’s incident and asked people to post pictures of unauthorised hawkers so that BMC officers are made aware of them. “The number of illegal hawkers is only increasing in Mumbai, and little is being done to stop that. It’s time that the same is brought to larger public notice through social media,” he said.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 04:44:28,timesofindia.indiatimes

KOLHAPUR: Around 20 members of the youth wing of Shiv Sena stormed the Holy Cross Convent High School at Kasaba Bawada and ransacked the office of the school principal, after parents were asked for an additional Rs 7,000 for each student in the junior kindergarten.There are 134 students in the school’s junior kindergarten. The school has lodged a complaint at Shahupuri police station.Police officers said a group of about 20 young men from Yuva Sena stormed the principal’s office and questioned the demand for a building fund from parents of tiny tots. The matter was debated for 15 minutes, and the principal then had to leave her office to lead the school prayers. Sena youth then vandalised the office.The Sena youth had met the principal two weeks ago, seeking that this burden not be placed on parents. Staff and parents gathered at the school soon after the attack and met Superintendent of Police Abhinav Deshmukh.They demanded prompt action against the accused. Deshmukh told school staff that they ought to have approached police when the youth first visited the school.A police officer at Shahupuri police station said, “We booked around 25 youth under several sections of IPC including 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and several others. We have not yet arrested anyone. Action will proceed in accordance with law.”Principal Bharati Pathare said, “We discussed the fee matter with the men. They told us that parents have complaints. We asked them to hand over complaints of parents to us. They refused to do that, and continued a conversation for 15 minutes. When I told them that it was time of our morning assembly prayers, they went out of the office. Soon as I left, they went back in and vandalised the office.”The principal said the school had collected Rs 7,000 from parents of each student admitted to junior KG.“Ours is a school that receives no government grants for the primary section. We need funds for the maintenance of the building. Not a single parent has complained to me so far. If a parent is unable to pay, the school makes provision for them. Some parents have also come forward to help parents of those students who are unable to pay fees.”Shiv Sena’s MLA from Kolhapur city Rajesh Kshirsagar said, “The school administration gives admission to students through lottery. The school has good reputation, and everyone wants their child to be admitted there. Through lottery system some poor students also get admission. They manage to pay regular fees but are financially strained to pay additional charges.”He said, “Two weeks ago, some parents complained about this. A delegation of youth met the school administration and requested them to not to take money from poor parents in the name of building fund. The school agreed. On Monday, the parents again complained that the school had made this sum mandatory. That is when members of the youth wing went to question the school administration.”The MLA said the school administration’s attitude enraged the youth. “I condemn the violence, but I support their cause,” he added.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 12:06:13,timesofindia.indiatimes

MADURAI: Thousands of firework industry labourers, who have been remained jobless since early November following the closure of 1,070 firecrackers units in Sivakasi , participated in a ‘Kanji Thotti’ protest staged across Virudhunagar district on Saturday, demanding the state and union government to address their woes.The protest was organised in 38 different places – predominantly in Sivakasi, Sattur and Virudhunagar – on Saturday. During the demonstration, the firework labourers demanded the union government to ensure the immediate reopening of all the factories or else the state government to pay a relief of Rs 10,000 per month to all those labourers who have been affected due to the indefinite closure.It may be noted that right from November 4, when the factories were closed for Diwali , they didn’t resume production due to stringent guidelines from the Supreme Court regarding firecracker manufacturing. Further, the apex court also instructed the factories to manufacture green fireworks.PN Deva, Virudhunagar district general secretary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), claimed that the livelihood of almost 4.8-5 lakh people was totally affected due to the closure of the factories and until the rules and guidelines for manufacturing green crackers were formulated, the cracker units should be allowed to function as it is. “The next hearing in the case is on January 22, when we’ll explain our situation and put forth our demands,” he said.‘Kanji thotti’ protest will be held in 20 other places in the district on Sunday as well.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 12:06:21,timesofindia.indiatimes

AHMEDABAD: After staging protests on streets alleging commercialization of the V S Hospital and shifting its human resources to the newly built Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Hospital, the opposition Congress party on Friday approached Gujarat high court to join in a litigation by hospital’s donor trustees.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the state-of-the art hospital on Thursday. Various Congress leaders registered their protests in different parts of the city against the alleged commercialization.Dinesh Sharma, the leader of the opposition in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), filed a petition in the high court requesting it to permit him to join the petition filed by Brijeshbhai and Rupaben Chinai, who belong to one of two donor families for Chinai Prasuti Gruh and Sheth Vadilal Sarabhai Hospital.The donor trustees have objected to the formation of Medical Education Trust (MET) by AMC, which according to the petitioners, was to divest them from the management of the two hospitals and enable AMC corporators, bureaucrats and politicians to take complete control of the trust. The move to disturb the trustee board took place by placing a member of the ruling party in AMC in place of the representative of the opposition.The petitioners submitted that the proposal was mooted to demolish the old buildings of VS Hospital to pave way for the parking facilities of the newly constructed multi-specialty hospital. The move was to shift the 1,155 beds and all equipment, staff and employees from the two hospitals to the new hospital, which would be run by MET.The petitioners took up the issue of change in formation of the trust board before the charity commissioner, who passed a vague order asking all the concerned parties to amicably solve the issue. The charity commissioner did not pass any order resolving the issue. The petitioners submitted before the HC that the charity commissioner’s order was silent as to how the two hospitals would run with only 120 beds and in absence of staff, equipment and furniture. They have challenged the charity commissioner's order.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 12:06:30,timesofindia.indiatimes

CHENNAI: Engineering graduates from colleges affiliated to Anna University staged a protest in Gunidy here on Friday opposing the new exam regulation introduced last year.The varsity has agreed to look into their demands by forming a committee.Earlier, students , who flunked in their semester exams, were allowed to take up a supplementary exam soon after the exam results are out. Arrear exams were conducted in the same academic year for those who didn't clear supplementary exams.In 2017, Anna University introduced Choice Based Credit System (CBCS), based on the All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) guidelines. Under this, students attend seven core or elective subjects (worth three/four credit points each) along with an employment enhancement course (worth two credit points).The maximum number of credits a student can register in a particular semester can't exceed 36 points.Of the 36 points, nearly 24 credits get consumed by current semester courses and students can get only 12 points for reappearance. This indicated that students can reappear only for maximum of three papers at a time.Also, students, who flunked in their even semesters (held in March/April) can reappear for backlogs only next March/April. The same applies to odd semester exams held in November.Rajesh, one among the hundreds of students who protested on Friday, said they were forced to wait over a year to clear backlogs thereby affecting their career prospects.Responding to it, J Kumar, registrar, Anna University said there was not awareness among students about the curriculum and a committee would be formed to look into their demands.",05 May 2019,2019-05-05 12:40:32,timesofindia.indiatimes

Picture by UB Photos
Xilpi Diwas, observed in Assam on the death anniversary of cultural icon Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, was marked by protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on Thursday.
Artistes, freedom fighters, several organisations and the people recalled Agarwala and sought inspiration from his songs and poems to face the “crisis” appearing before the state because of the bill.
Artistes and freedom fighters burnt copies of the bill in front of Agarwala’s photograph at Rangiya in Kamrup district and vowed to fight against the bill that seeks to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who had fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan because of religious persecution and entered India till December 31, 2014.
The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on January 8 and is likely to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha in the budget session, beginning January 31.
“If the bill is passed, Assam will witness a Tripura-like situation. People of Assam should draw inspiration from the songs of Agarwala, Bishnu Prasad Rabha and Bhupen Hazarika at this moment,” said singer Pankaj Bordoloi at a programme organised at Tezpur in central Assam’s Sonitpur district.
Ethnic people, who were in majority in Tripura, are said to have turned into minorities because of unabated influx from 1947 onwards from erstwhile East Pakistan.
Hundreds protested in Tezpur, responding to a call by singer Zubeen Garg who criticised chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal for not opposing the bill.
Zubeen and his designer wife Garima had met All Assam Students’ Union leaders here on Wednesday and vowed to launch a protest against the bill.
At night, at a cultural programme at Ahatguri in central Assam’s Morigaon district, he was vocal against the BJP government over the bill.
He said he would distribute the remuneration he had received from the BJP for singing songs for its 2016 Assembly election.
Sonowal also faced protests in Darrang district while going to attend a Xilpi Diwas function.
In Upper Assam’s Jorhat district, students of Chutia community and 13 other organisations blocked National Highway 37 at Teok and people organised a 10km human chain at Selenghat in Mariani.
At a Xilpi Diwas programme organised at Jorhat theatre hall, in which former chief minister Tarun Gogoi participated, a protest was staged against the bill.
In Goalpara district in lower Assam, black flags were hoisted ahead of state BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass’s visit to participate in a Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council election meeting.
In Silchar, headquarters of Hailakandi district in Barak Valley, Xilpi Diwas was observed for the first time under the auspices of Asam Sahitya Sabha.

BHOPAL: The junior works manager of Gun Carriage Factory (GCF) Jabalpur office - Sarada Charan Khatua - was hacked to death, autopsy report revealed on Wednesday. He was said to be in possession of some important information related to the Bofors case , said sources.""We would be registering a murder case. Injuries on his head were inflicted with sharp-edged weapons,"" said Jabalpur SP Amit Singh Khatua, who was missing since January 17,in a deserted area of the city on Tuesday evening.""Traitors murdered my brother. He was cooperating with the CBI probe and was going to share some classified documents. My brother was kidnapped and killed by those involved in this scam. They should not be spared,"" Sarada's brother Rajan Khatua told TOI. He too works in GCF.Ranjan said a GCF officer had called his wife asking for email ID and password on behalf of the CBI. ""His number is also switched off,"" he said.Meanwhile, a delegation of GCF employees association met state minister Lakhan Ghangoria and demanded action against police officials accountable for lethargic investigations into the missing person complaint.Khatua had vanished a week after being questioned by CBI in connection with the alleged supply and use of Chinese parts in indigenized Bofors guns . His body was found in a decomposed state at a deserted region near the ordnance factory.A local resident grew suspicious about Khatua’s abandoned scooty on Tuesday and called police, who then found the body. Khatua’s family members allege he was murdered as part of a conspiracy, but police initially believed he committed suicide.Khatua was last seen at 8.54am on January 17 in a footage collected from traffic cams. His wife had filed a missing person complaint that night. In June 2017, CBI had lodged an FIR against a Delhi-based company and ‘unknown’ officers of GCF Jabalpur following a tip-off that China-made parts were masked as ‘made in Germany’ and supplied to GCF for Bofors. GCF officials claim the inquiry is a result of a dispute between foreign partners of the company that got the contract from GCF.As per policy, Chinese products are not used in Indian defence products.The CBI FIR alleges that the supplier connived with GCF officials to supply duplicate spare parts (bearings) used in the manufacture of 155mm Dhanush guns — indigenized version of Bofors artillery guns that turned the tide of the 1999 Kargil conflict.Investigators suspect some GCF officials accepted Chinese manufactured ‘wire race roller bearings’ that were embossed ‘CRBmade in Germany’.GCF officials argue the German company is to blame for supplying Chinese parts to India.During investigation, it was found that the Delhi-based company had submitted ‘certificates in origin’, showing that the bearings were purchased from a German company. Those parts had ‘made in Germany’ labels, sources say. When bearings failed quality tests, the company gave clarifications and assured to replace defective parts free of cost.CBI says the German company does not manufacture these parts. Investigators suspect the Delhi-based company got six bearings manufactured by Sino United Industries (Luyang) Ltd Henan, China.

INDORE: Twenty-four hours after three gunmen shot dead businessman Sandeep Agarwal in the busy Vijay Nagar area, police are no closer to identifying the attackers though they have CCTV footage of them, and found the getaway car abandoned in Talawali Chanda, 9km from the scene of crime.The car bore registration numbers that belonged to a woman doctor in Bhopal , according to the Madhya Pradesh transport department website. But the number plate was probably forged, DIG Harinarayanchari Mishra said.The attackers had fled in a white hatchback after firing several shots at Sandeep Agarwal in front of Cross Roads Complex, barely 50m from Vijay Nagar police station.Police have rounded around 30 suspects who are being interrogated at different locations, say sources. Seven teams of police, along with Crime Branch, cyber cops and Special Task Force (STF) have been roped in to crack the crime. Agarwal, who is known to have been involved in various businesses, including owning a local media channel, has had differences with many of his partners, say police. He was also involved in several high profile land deals.“During initial investigation, it came to fore that the victim had 11 criminal cases, including that of operating a betting racket, printing ‘fake’ notes and disputes related to properties, registered against him at various police stations of Indore . The victim used to work as moneylender, too,” SP Avdhesh Goswami said.Investigators believe Agarwal recently entered into a Rs 20 crore deal to buy a local media channel, but it seems to have gone sour, triggering bitterness among partners. Police are yet to ascertain the exact motive behind the murder, but believe that the shooters are ‘outsiders’. “They were not afraid of revealing their identity as they were not covering their faces. They also appeared determined to kill the ‘target’. Two of them maintained a calm demeanour and walked away casually after shooting Agarwal,” Goswami pointed out, adding: “One of the attackers seems to have a leg injury as he was limping .” Police are questioning a known shooter from Ratlam, who walks with a limp. History-sheeters like Manohar Verma and Pintu Thakur are also being grilled.Agarwal’s autopsy done at MY Hospital. “Three bullets were recovered from the body,” forensic experts said, adding that injury marks indicated that some more bullets went through and through. His last rites were performed at Tilak Nagar crematorium, where police took one person into custody for disturbing peace.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 00:19:22,timesofindia.indiatimes

INDORE: Maintenance of Internal Security Act ( MISA ) detainees on Wednesday staged a demonstration at Regal Square against Congress-led state government for stopping their pension.“During Emergency between June 25, 1975 and March 21, 1977, thousands of people were arrested for staging protest against the then government and were put behind bars. Later, these detainees were honoured with status of Loktantra Senani along with benefits of Loktantra Senani Samman Nidhi (pension),” Akhil Bharatiya Loktantra Senani Sangh, Indore secretary Ganesh Agrawal told TOI.He added that most of the MISA detainees are above 70 years of age and need pension for their medicines and maintenance. Stopping their pension will be inappropriate and inhuman. “If state government fails to restart the pension in days to come, the detainees and their family members will launch a series of protest in Bhopal ,” Agrawal said.There are 229 MISA detainees in Indore district . They will have to go through process of physical verification to continue getting pension from the government.The then BJP-led state government had increased pension to MISA detainees from Rs 3,000 in 2008 to Rs 25,000 in 2015. After their death, their wives were ordered to provide half of the pension Rs 12,500.The order issued by GAD deputy secretary Dharnendra Kumar Jain reads that in examination of the accounts, it came to fore that budget allocated for distribution of Loktantra Senani Samman Nidhi to MISA detainees has been exceeding. In this scenario, the department finds it difficult to justify it before Public Accounts Committee.“As per the instructions, physical verification of registered pensioners will be carried out and based on the findings, the authority concerned will decide further course of action. Till then, pension will not be distributed,” SDM Shashwat Sharma told TOI.",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 12:07:08,timesofindia.indiatimes

Vadodara: Based on a representation made by the Vadodara Parents Association (VPA), the district education officer (DEO) of Vadodara has decided to issue notices to private schools who are allegedly harassing students.On Wednesday, VPA’s office-bearers had staged a dharna at the DEO premises demanding action against private unaided schools that are allegedly not following the provisional fees declared by the fee regulatory committee (FRC).According to VPA office-bearers, in gross violation of the Gujarat Self Finance Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017 as well as the interim orders of the Supreme Court, some schools are demanding fees that is much more than the prescribed fees and also threatening the students.VPA in its representation to the DEO said that some private schools are not only demanding fees which is much more than the provisional fees decided by FRC but also threatening students of dire consequences.The students, according to the parents’ body, are being threatened by three city-based schools, which have started levying hefty daily penalties by insisting that parents pay Rs 200 to Rs 250 for first day of delay and subsequently Rs 25 per day.DEO U S Rathod told TOI that the office will issue notices to the private schools against whom it has received complaint from the parents’ body.“FRC is the final authority. But under no circumstances students should be put under any mental trauma. W will issue a notice to the said schools,” he said.“For now, we are seeking clarification from the managements. Based on their replies, we will take further action,” he added.Many parents are still concerned as despite several months, the FRC of Vadodara zone is yet to finalize provisional fees of nearly 15 private schools within the city. Those schools whose provisional fees has been finalised by the FRC, have not bothered to inform the parents .",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 12:07:25,timesofindia.indiatimes

The forum has been agitating to press for a hike in stipends and quicker disbursement of research funds.
The students conducted the protest in support of the forum’s demand for an 80% hike in fellowship.
The forum has been on a strike in Delhi since January 16 to press for the implementation of the key demand.
Unkept promises
According to the Jipmer research scholars, the fellowship amount has been stagnant for almost five years.
Although the Ministry of Human Resource Development had acknowledged these demands and had promised to fulfil them within a certain time-frame, no action had followed, say the scholars.
According to the students, with no hike in stipend since 2014 and inflation growing, research scholars were hard-pressed to fulfil even the basic necessities of their families.

The incident raised tempers among the local residents, who staged a snap protest at the junction, causing a traffic jam for over an hour.
The deceased, Dodda Muniyappa, a resident of Iblur, was working with a private bank in the city. He was crossing the road with others after the traffic police stopped vehicles to allow pedestrians to move. A truck suddenly appeared, knocking down Muniyappa and running over him while other pedestrians jumped to safety, the police said.
The truck driver abandoned the vehicle and fled from the spot as people raised an alarm and tried to pull out Muniyappa, the traffic police said. A few persons rushed Muniyappa to a private hospital nearby, where the doctors declared him as brought dead.
Hundreds of people protested after the accident, blocking the Outer Ring Road and demanding safety of pedestrians. They sought a skywalk at Iblur junction — which has been a long-pending demand of citizens — to prevent such accidents. Hundreds of vehicles were stranded for an hour in and around Iblur junction during the protest.

“I saw my daughter lying in the fields, her clothes torn and nail marks all over her body. Police recorded all this, but is siding with the accused now,” alleged the father of the deceased who reached the farm to rescue her.
The said incident occurred on Saturday evening in a village under Jaitpur police station of Barabanki. According to the girl’s family members, she went to her farm in the evening where three men from a nearby village pulled her to a secluded place and gang-raped her.
At around 5pm, the accused left her bleeding in the field and fled the scene. She was rescued by her parents and other villagers and was rushed to a community health centre.
Officials from the local police station recorded her statement at the health centre before she succumbed to her injuries.
The fact that the girl had several external injuries on her body was corroborated by the post-mortem examination performed by a panel of doctors. The panel found over a dozen cuts on the upper body and neck of the girl concluding that she succumbed to the injuries.
The doctors have collected the swabs from her private organs and sent them to forensic laboratory to confirm rape. The post-mortem examination was recorded on tape for future reference. The girl’s father claimed that police took ₹800 from them to cover the cost of the video recording.
Meanwhile, the local police have charged one Sunil Verma, who lives in the nearby village, under section 304 (attempt to murder). He was arrested and sent to prison on judicial custody.
The family members, on the other hand, allege that the girl in her statement had accused two other relatives of the accused who had not been arrested yet. “She took names of three people but the police have only arrested Sunil. Besides, they have only charged him for attempt to murder even after my daughter has died,” said the victim’s father.
Rebuffing the allegations, the police said that it were not siding with the accused. “We are still investigating the case and looking into the role of others in the incident. More arrests will be made if needed,” said superintendent of police (SP) of Barabanki, Satish Kumar.

Office of Krishna factory near Karad in Satara on fire
Farmers to target Amit Shah visit: Shetti
Download The Times of India News App for Latest City
KOLHAPUR: Unrest among sugarcane growers over delayed and part payment by sugar factories took a violent turn on Saturday with a group of farmers torching the offices of two sugar mills and forcibly closing down four offices.The two mills whose offices were set on fire by unidentified farmers are in Satara and Sangli districts, while the four offices that were ransacked and forcibly shut down are in Kolhapur district . Police have intensified security at sugar mills across the three districts.Police said they have registered offences against unidentified people in all the six cases and are trying to identify the attackers.The incidents took place soon after farmers realised that most of the private and cooperative sugar factories had only deposited 80% of the money they owed them in their bank accounts. They are upset as it’s mandatory for factories to make full payment within 14 days after cane is taken for crushing.The factories deposited the money at the rate of Rs 2,300 per tonne while the fair and remunerative price (FRP) is Rs 2,800 per tonne. Most of the factories in Maharashtra have not made payment to farmers for more than three months now, creating unrest in the sugar belt.Thirty-seven factories in Sangli and Kolhapur districts have been served notices by the office of the sugar commissioner for violation of the Sugarcane Control Act.Delay in payment to sugarcane farmers has become a big issue in western Maharashtra, the sugar bowl of the state. “A group of unidentified men gathered outside the Kranti Sugar Factory in Sangli district and Krishna Sugar Factory near Karad in Satara district around Friday midnight and set afire the gate cane offices,” said the police.According to the police, the offices were heavily damaged by the attackers. In similar incidents, the offices of four sugar factories — Jawahar, Datta, Gurudatta and Kurundwad — in Kolhapur district were damaged and forcibly closed down by angry farmers.The factories expressed their inability to make the payment at one go to the farmers, citing huge difference in manufacturing cost and actual price of sugar in the retail market.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) has warned that it would not accept part payment. It has also demanded an additional Rs 200 FRP per tonne. SSS leader Raju Shetti said his organisation will intensify agitation if the cane farmers’ demands are not met within four days. Speaking after a marathon meeting to discuss the plight of farmers on Saturday night, he said farmers will gather in Kolhapur and seek an explanation from BJP leader Amit Shah on their plight when he arrives in the city on January 24. “If the sugar cane farmers’ payment is not cleared within four days, we will intensify the agitation,” he said.” Shetti criticized the government and sugar factories saying that both have been cheating farmers for more than two months. “Factories had come together to make part payment to the farmers and it was a do-or-die battle for farmers.”",06 May 2019,2019-05-06 12:07:43,timesofindia.indiatimes

Solan, January 12
Trouble again erupted between two rival transport unions in Parwanoo as members of both groups attacked each other leading to registration of cross-FIRs.
While the incident has vitiated the peaceful atmosphere of the town, the police have stationed two reserves to prevent further any untoward incident in the town.
The Additional SP(ASP), Shiv Kumar Sharma, said in the first case, a complaint was registered by Pradeep Kumar, who alleged that when he was climbing the stairs of his in-laws house near a temple in the Sector 2, Parwanoo, four persons attacked him with rods around 10.30 am. Kumar sustained injuries along with two other persons. A case under Sections 451, 323 and 34 of the IPC for house trespass and causing hurt has been registered on his complaint.
In another case, Sukhwinder Singh has alleged that he was attacked with swords when he was in the Sector 3-based office of the local Canter union and miscreants also threatened him by firing four rounds in the air around 1pm on Saturday. Singh is Pramod Sharma’s driver, whose group had gained control of the canter union office in the Sector 3 area of the town, earlier this week.
Since an FIR had been registered by the members of the Hardeep Bawa group over a few days ago, the Saturday’s attack on Pradeep was being seen as its repercussion. With virtually no fear of law, the rival transport groups, spared no effort in not only attacking the Sector 3-based office of the canter union, but went as far as firing in the air, not caring two hoots for the law.
ASP Sharma, who visited Parwanoo after the upheaval, said a team of forensic science experts had taken evidence from the spot and four empty cartridges had also been recovered.
He said the law and order situation was under control.
With the state government failing to take any effective step to chalk out a permanent solution to this brewing feud between the two rival transport unions, the peaceful ambience of the town has been disrupted time and again. Not only have the residents been exposed to unruly clashes, but a sense of insecurity was building among residents due to the inept handling of this dispute.
This was the third occasion when violent clashes had taken place between these transporters.",13 Jan 2019,2019-01-13 08:54:00,tribuneindia
