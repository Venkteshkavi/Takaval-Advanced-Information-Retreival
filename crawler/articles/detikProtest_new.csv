(Hasan Alhabshy / detikcom) Jakarta - The event of the KRI Tjipadi-381 crash by a Vietnamese fishing vessel took place in Natuna waters. Professor of international law at the University of Indonesia, Hikmahanto Juwana, explained the problem: there were overlapping claims at that point. &quot;The incident that occurred in the North Natuna Sea region due to overlapping claims between Indonesia and Vietnam over the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ),&quot; said Hikmahanto in his press statement on Tuesday (04/30/2019). The overlap in question is not a matter of the territorial sea under state sovereignty, but the EEZ limit. ZEE is a high seas, the country concerned has sovereign rights over natural resources in the sea column. Indonesia and Vietnam do not have this EEZ boundary agreement.

Including 4 who died and two had miscarriages. With many exhausted democracy fighters, the Blitar Regency Election Commission regretted that there were still those who considered it fraudulent. Blitar Regency KPU HR Division Ragil Agus Tridarmanto said, it was only limited to recording who had fallen election officials. Due to insurance and medical expenses, there is already a mechanism that regulates it. &quot;We are limited to data collection. For those who die there is indeed money. But for the cost of medical treatment, we are waiting for the decision of the Central KPU first,&quot; Ragil told AFP on Tuesday (04/30/2019).

Even now plano can be photographed and disseminated,&quot; he added. Even to dismiss these allegations, there are rules for two-period KPPS officers. According to Imron, the regulation is not fair.

If those who are experienced cannot be used again for reasons of potential fraud, I think it is unfair. Technology and social media are sophisticated to monitor and supervise all the processes, &quot;said the 46-year-old woman. Imron added that the certification discourse for KPPS officers was actually very good. But it is difficult to realize. The problem is that many educated workers are reluctant to carry out the task of guarding this democratic process. &quot;Many are scholars who are capable, but don&#39;t want to. KPPS certification is also very good. But let alone certification, now many people have said kapok. Don&#39;t want to be KPPS anymore,&quot; he concluded. The moral burden of being a KPPS is the main reason they don&#39;t want to carry out this job again. When working non-stop in vote counting, while the income compensation obtained is not equal, it also becomes the basis for them to become KPPS again.

Still the answer was disappointing, we were not given an entry because we had to bring our own items with the words of 1 person. We ask for my child&#39;s items, my parents who carry it but still are not permitted. That&#39;s our right as 6 people have the right to 7 kg per person that we demand. Instead of helping them to lift my children up, they said they had to take 1 person. There was no solution and their sense of empathy until finally our info was cut off from the PIC that it should not rise. During the debate in the video there was also no one to hear that from the plane there was an announcement that our name was called to enter the plane by Lion Air. And we have been left behind by the plane. Disappointed seeing a child crying we asked for accountability by meeting the Lion manager but not meeting him. They know my weakness is in children.
