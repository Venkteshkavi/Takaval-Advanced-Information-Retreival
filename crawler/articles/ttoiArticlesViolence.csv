After their marriage, the couple shifted toAjmerinRajasthanwhere the woman was working last year.Around a week after their marriage, her husband, who was unemployed, began asking for money from her to fulfil his daily requirements. The man had allegedly taken her debit and credit cards and started spending money on his lavish lifestyle, alleged the complaint, adding that he used to beat her if she ever resisted his spending.As the woman had married against her family’s will, she continued to tolerate tortures of her husband. Moreover, her in-laws also began harassing her for demanding money from her father’s place. Aggrieved with harassment, the complainant returned to her father’s place in August 2018 and also filed an application with Sola High Court police but she later had to strike compromise in the case with her husband as he convinced her that he would take divorce from her and would not harass her.But later, he once again started calling and threatening her due to which she filed the FIR with police."

Jayarajan is an accused in the murder of Shukkur and Manoj. RMPI state secretary N Venu had told media persons that the party is thinking of a meeting of the victims of CPM violence.“We are against the kind of politics pursued by Jayarajan and would like to associate with any campaign against him. But this is not the time for such programmes. We do not wish to be part of a programme to promote Muraleedharan,” an RSS leader inKannursaid.“There are more crucial issues such as the return of the Modi government and the developments after the Sabarimala. Muraleedharan had taken a tough stand against Valsan Thillenkari and K Surendran who were in the forefront of theSabarimalaagitations,” he said.It is learnt that there is also a confusion in the RMPI also in joining hands with the BJP and the RSS. Many believe it will give credence to the CPM’s allegation that there is a secret understanding with the RMPI and the BJP in Vadakara.CPM district secretary P Mohanan said holding of the programme may not be entirely the idea of the RMPI. “The party could be organising the programme at the instance of the UDF,” he said.Mohanan said as many as 93 CPM workers have been murdered by the RSS, the Congress and the IUML in the areas coming under the Vadakara constituency. Jayarajan himself is the victim of the political violence but he is being branded as a murderer, he said."

""The village of Ogossagou is completely devastated.""One village resident, who asked not to be identified, said the attack appeared to be in retaliation for an al Qaeda affiliate's claim of responsibility on Friday for a raid last week that killed 23 soldiers.The group said the raid was payback for violence by Mali's army and militiamen against the Fulani.Jihadist groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have exploited ethnic rivalries in Mali and its neighbours Burkina Faso and Niger to boost recruitment and render vast swaths of territory virtually ungovernable."

Though films are a powerful medium of communication and filmmakers share the onus of portraying violence and social evils responsibly, making the entertainment sector a scapegoat, ignores the root cause for criminal activity, they feel.Former judge of the Madras high court K Chandru says linking crimes to celluloid is a naive approach. ""If a person is caught copying in exams, we say ‘Munna Bhai’ method and if it’s a runaway marriage, ‘Alaipayuthey’ style but these are verbal statements to make sense of a situation, it does not mean these movies are directly responsible. ""Ever since the IPC was created in 1860, various pieces of legislation have been passed to control crime, but it never could put an end to it. A person after watching a movie may get carried away and if he implements the same in real life, it goes to show his character. A bench with suo motu files can’t pass orders that are not relevant to today’s times.""Actor and politician Khushbu feels such observations are a simplistic way of looking at things. She argues that if violent serials and movies can motivate some people to commit immoral or criminal acts, then there’s also a huge section that is inspired by the good deeds shown on screen. For instance ‘Munna Bhai’s ‘jadu ki jhappi’ (magic of a hug) is more remembered than the fraud dealings of the character.""Recently there was an incident of a man stabbing his wife inside the court premises, now which cinema or serial can be blamed for such a heinous act. If it can happen in a protected environment like within the court premises, imagine the scale of brazenness people adopt doing such acts elsewhere. It depends on the upbringing, environment and mindset of a person. Also, as an industry, we have hit out at such things through films and in reality,"" says Khushbu.After the 2014 Nirbhaya incident, the film industry faced a backlash over commodification of women, disregarding the complexities that led to such an act. Misogyny in films is undeniable, but filmmakers are becoming increasingly aware of the need for context and sensitivity while portraying characters.Kutty Padmini, actor and MD of Vaishnave Mediaa Works agrees with the court observation. The veteran actor, who had been producing television serials till a decade ago, stopped it because she did not want to be associated with stories that revolve around negativity.""Stale plots that deal with the murder of daughters-in-law and husbands reek of low values. A few months ago, we witnessed a producer killing his wife, chopping her body into pieces and strewing them in a dump yard. He had confessed to having drawn inspiration from films. It shows that as a responsible medium, we should be cautious of the message we put out,"" says Padmini.Producer and founder-dean of BOFTA G Dhananjayan feels television serials should also keep values in mind. ""Why can’t we go for content that does not glorify adultery or vengeance. A good film does more than entertain or fill seats at the cinema, it has the power to change hearts and minds – and sometimes society at large,"" he says.Spiralling crime in society cannot be simplified and presumed to be because of serials and movies. Cinema may be a contributor, but singling it out is no solution. After all, how many culprits have confessed to emulating a scene from a crime thriller?"

Israel believes the so-called “Accountability” resolution said the Council pronounced judgment against Israel without instituting a commission of inquiry as promised, instead condemned Israel for “disproportionate use of force.”According to the Israel foreign minister, the HRC resolution “absolves Hamas of responsibility”. “The report ignored the publicly stated purpose of the events — to storm and breach Israel’s border — and does not give any consideration to the possibility that a mob which includes Hamas militants would storm and attack the 70000 Israeli civilians living in towns and communities adjacent to the Gaza border.”He added that the UNHRC ignored the fact that eight months of violent riots, weapons, and infiltration attempts by militants were available for documentation, yet only two incidents were felt to be hostile to Israel.The other countries to abstain were UK,Japan, Italy, Denmark, Iceland and Nepal.

These districts were excluded from the left wing extremism list by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) in April last year.In 2018, the state had witnessed minimum Maoist violence when compared to the previous 13 years, thanks to a financial crackdown on top Maoist leaders by theEnforcement Directorate, which attached their movable and immovable properties worth several crores in the state.In August last year, the MHA had declared Aurangabad, Gaya, Jamui and Lakhisarai as 30 left wing extremism-affected districts in the country which record maximum Maoist violence. Aurangabad, Gaya, Jamui and Nawada will go to polls in the first phase on April 11.Chief electoral officer (CEO) H R Srinivasa told TOI over the phone that security forces would remain on full alert even in the districts which are no more considered as Maoist-infested.“We are on high alert. The areas in Jharkhand, which share border with four Maoist-hit constituencies in Bihar, are not going to polls in the first phase. This has to be kept in mind for making security arrangements,” he said.The last two general elections saw large scale Maoist violence in the state. In 2009 LS polls, seven people, including six security personnel, were killed in Maoist violence in the state. In 2014, five security personnel were killed and 16 injured in such attacks.According to data available with officials at the CEO office, a sub-inspector (SI), a magistrate and five constables were killed in Maoist attacks in 2009 general election.

The talks began January 24 in Sudan's capital, Khartoum.The agreement represents rare hope for the impoverished, landlocked nation where interreligious and intercommunal fighting has continued since 2013. Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in a conflict that has sent at least two people to the International Criminal Court.""This is a great day for Central African Republic and all its people,"" said the AU commissioner for peace and security, Smail Chergui.The fighting in Central African Republic has carried the high risk of genocide, the UN has warned. Scores of mosques have been burned. Priests and other religious leaders have been killed. Many Muslims have fled the country.After more than 40 people were killed in a rebel attack on a displaced persons camp in November, both the leader of the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission and the country's prime minister both acknowledged shortcomings in the response. ""I knew that we did not have all the necessary means to protect our people,"" the prime minister said.The fighting began in 2013 when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back. Violence intensified and spread last year after a period of relative peace as armed groups battle over lands rich in gold, diamonds and uranium.In a grim report last year marking five years of the conflict, the UN children's agency said fighters often target civilians rather than each other, attacking health facilities and schools, mosques and churches and camps for displaced people. At least half of the more than 640,000 people displaced are children, it said, and thousands are thought to have joined the armed groups, often under pressure.As the peace talks began, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned of ""catastrophe"" if no agreement was reached, saying repeated cycles of violence in one of the world's poorest nations had ""pushed people(asterisk)s resistance to breaking point.""A majority of Central African Republic's 2.9 million people urgently need humanitarian support, the group said.On Thursday, the UN Security Council voted unanimously to extend an arms embargo on Central African Republic for a year but raised the possibility that it could be lifted earlier as the government has long urged."

""We are still scared.""Myanmar hopes to obtain UNESCO world heritage status for Mrauk U, and the Myanmar Archaeology Association Monday expressed concerns that the ongoing clashes might affect its nomination.It issued an emergency appeal for all sides to demarcate the town as a ""fire-free zone"".The army said they deployed troops to downtown Mrauk U after receiving a tip-off the AA was going to mount an attack.The insurgent group could not be reached for comment.Authorities have vowed to crush the rebellion, which has simmered since the group's formation in 2009.The rebels enjoy widespread support from ethnic Rakhine, who have felt marginalised for decades in one of the country's poorest states.But thousands have been displaced by the spreading violence which is also edging closer to the state capital Sittwe.Much of Rakhine is in a strict lockdown and information is difficult to verify independently."

""After that he'll be able to pay bail and get out on parole. Then, when there's a general amnesty, he'll benefit from it.""That is why specific legislation is needed, women's rights activists argue.They hold periodic sit-ins at parliament to demand passage of the law, noting that it was drafted by civil society, Islamic scholars and jurists and stayed within the bounds of Sharia law.MPs from both the ruling party and the opposition voted down the bill in January 2017.In December 2018, the draft did not even proceed past the parliament's Islamic Orientation Commission, which vets proposed law for its conformity with Sharia.""We rejected this law because it was not aligned with Sharia and our cultural specificities,"" said Zeinabou Taghi, an MP of the opposition Islamist party Tewassoul.The penalties ""appear to interfere with private life,"" she said.She objected to punishing a man for forbidding his wife to wear figure-revealing clothes, or for forbidding his daughter to live on her own with no husband.For her part, opposition MP Nana Mint Cheikhna of the Rally for Democratic Forces (RFD) said she backed the bill, despite reservations about vague text.""Women obviously need protection... in a society where they are considered minors, both in people's minds and in practice,"" she said.In September, HRW had praised the bill as a ""step in the right direction"" but said it ""falls short of international standards in several ways.""The draft bill ""fails to criminalise other forms of sexual assault"" besides rape, it said, adding that it still criminalised consensual extra-marital sex and allowed the law criminalisingabortionto remain on the books."

""The president was clear, he does not want the post-debate period to be like the one before the debate.""Less than three months before European elections that anti-establishment nationalists want to use as a show of force across the continent, a lost referendum could also backfire and offer Macron's opponents an opportunity to challenge his legitimacy.The anti-government protests have shown the French crave less inequality, between Paris and the poorest parts of the country as much as between the poor and the rich in general.That's why the worst violence since November has targeted the Champs-Elysees boulevard and its boutiques, symbols of an opulent, successful, bourgeois Paris that those who struggle to make ends meet in the provinces resent.Reducing territorial inequalities and ""making work pay"" for the poorest was an integral part of Macron's 2017 manifesto, his aides say, and they are confident households will start to feel the benefits of measures put in place in the last 22 months.He gave priority early in his presidency to pro-business tax cuts over measures to help low-income workers, and that angered left-leaning voters.With France having one of the world's highest tax burdens, financing costly measures to reduce the sense of isolation in small towns and the countryside by adding more hospitals or re-opening closed schools would be difficult, Macron's aides say.That means his response is more likely to be a mix of symbolic measures meant to give more say to people and changes to education and training systems.""We've reached the limits of spreading wealth,"" one adviser said. ""But the potential is huge for tackling the roots of inequalities. So we may have lost sight of some of our goals initially, but we're firmly back on track now and accelerating."""

Analysis of the accounts of 147 women survivors of violence from Delhi, north and south Karnataka,Assam,MeghalayaandTamil Naduand visits to 78 shelter homes shows that other reasons for which women were either abandoned or felt compelled to leave their families include sexual assault, old age, trafficking, opposition to women’s choices, abuse related to sexual orientation and physical and mental health issues.Titled - “Survivor Speak - Call for Action from Five States” the report draws out common findings from the state specific reports to highlight the concerns of women who live or have lived in shelter homes being run by NGOs under the government schemes like the Swadhar Greh scheme.Aimed at making shelters empowering spaces that offer rights-based support system to women, civil society networks came together in 2016 to form a diverse national network Lam-Lynti Chittara Neralu (an amalgamation of three languages Khasi, Telugu and Kannada that means to lead the way under the vista of stars). “The ground research on shelter is seen as a step to highlight the concerns raised by the survivors,” lead researcher from the network, Dr Amrita Nandy, said. The women organisations who are part of the network feel independent audits of all shelter homes is the need of the hour. They also want survivors who have lived in shelters to be part of the audit exercise.The study sample from Assam, Delhi, Meghalya and Tamil Nadu shows that 31 women survivors were married or were in a live-in arrangement, 29 women survivors were married but separated, 12 were widowed, 10 were abandoned and 27 were unmarried.In Delhi, of the 28 respondents spoken to, nine women had experienced abuse of some form in their natal families, including childsexual abuse. Four survivors had come to Delhi to seek shelter away from their families.For most survivors of violence moving to a shelter home was only seen as a last resort. The reasons that kept women away from taking refuge in a shelter were separation from children, a sense of alienation they experience in shelters and curbs on communication and mobility.In Karnataka during a focus group discussion, devadasi women reported being denied admission by the shelter homes. The study also highlights that the shelters are not inclusive spaces in the context of “women” who figure in the spectrum defined as LGBTQI community. Besides low remuneration to staff, nearly all shelter homes flagged issues of inadequate and irregular disbursal of funds."

Nationwide, protesters were estimated at 32,300, compared with 28,600 last week.ULTRA VIOLENTInterior Minister Christophe Castaner said that although the protest was relatively small, there had been more than 1,500 ""ultra violent"" people out looking for trouble.""They decided, perhaps as a swansong, to come attack - and I use their words - Paris,"" Castaner said, adding that more than 1,400 police officers were mobilised.A separate, peaceful march against climate change through central Paris drew as many 36,000 people, police estimated. Some 145,000 people marched nationwide.Yellow vest protesters had promised to draw bigger numbers to mark the fourth month since the movement erupted in mid November over since-scrapped fuel tax hikes and the cost of living.Named after the high-visibility vests French drivers have to keep in their cars and worn by protesters, the revolt swelled into a broader movement against Macron, his reforms and elitism.However, the weekly demonstrations, held every Saturday in Paris and other cities, have been generally getting smaller since December, when Paris saw some of the worst vandalism and looting in decades.After the spike in violence, Macron offered a package of concessions worth more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) aimed at boosting the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners.His government ordered police to crack down on the protests in January, leading to complaints of police brutality.The 41-year-old former investment banker also launched a series of national debates aimed at determining what policies people want the government to focus on. Saturday's protests coincided with the end of the debates."

Arjun Singh was with Trinamool then. Three months later, on Thursday, BJP activists took control of the office. Flags atop the building changed, but not the framed pictures inside, because Singh is with BJP now.The Atpur Trinamool party office at Ward 20 of the Bhatpara Municipality got a fresh coat of saffron paint minutes after Singh joined BJP in New Delhi. Curious eyes watched the men at work fearing what is in store. Pro-Arjun councillors had got the message earlier. They gathered at the Bhatpara Municipality office and distributed sweets to celebrate the changeover.Bhatpara Municipality vice-chairman Somnath Talukdar was among the few, who went to the Trinamool district party office at Madhyamgram to chalk out the party’s strategy after the chairman left the party. “Trinamool has a majority in the Bhatpara Municipality still. We can prove our majority at the opportune moment,” Talukdar said after coming back from Madhyamgram. As many as seven Trinamool councillors have already complained to Trinamool leader Nirmal Ghosh that they are getting threat calls from Arjun Singh loyalists. Food minister Jyoti Priya Mullick have asked these councillors to lodge a police complaint and ask for security.The battle of words has fuelled apprehensions of largescale violence in the area used to extortions and gang wars. Fear was writ large on the faces of the residents at Jagaddal’s Meghna More near Singh’s residence. Two policemen guarded the office-cum-residence of the Bhatpara MLA and Municipality chairman where he meets locals. “People came here yesterday. There are no visitors for him today,” a policeman said. The streets looked deserted with the entire locality fearing a showdown ahead of the polls.“We are scared. Street fights and gun battles are a regular these days in this locality. I fear that Singh’s joining BJP will escalate the tension further. I would expect the police to take steps to maintain peace in the locality,” said milk trader Subhrangshu Banerjee.Kashinath Debnath, a former employee of the Hukumchand Jute Mill, also kept fingers crossed. “This area has a mixed population. Singh and his men have a command over the Hindispeaking jute mill workers who came from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They are innocent and insecure people and easily come under the clutches of politicians. There has been a surge in BJP support at Jagaddal, Halisahar, Garulia and Kankinara,” Debnath said.Singh loyalist and Trinamool councillor of Titagarh Municipality, Manish Shukla, though, ruled out any such possibility. “We told Arjunda a week ago that we are going to stay with Trinamool even if he joins BJP,” Shukla said. Singh’s brother-in-law and Noapara MLA Sunil Singh is also staying back. But that doesn’t seem reassuring to the Jagaddal residents. Knives are out against “gaddars” while the Arjun brigade is getting set for retaliation. BJP leader Mukul Roy’s son and Trinamool MLA from Bijpur Subhranshu Roy tried to pacify nerves. “I was with Trinamool and am still with the party. I was under tremendous pressure when my father changed party affiliations. I would wish that pressure doesn’t come on Arjun’s wife and son,” he said."

They are a threat to the university and need to be tackled properly, said vice-chancellor of Nagpur University SP Kane, on Friday.Kane said these words in his presidential address at the 17th edition of ‘Justa Causa’, a three-day national festival, at Dr BabasahebAmbedkar Collegeof Law.Kane said, “A society cannot function without the existence of law. Therefore, laws are needed to be formulated and amended as time progresses. In a court, there are lawyers and judges. Nobody ever questions the decisions of the judge. However, in a university, the VC has to play both, the lawyer and the judge, if the decisions are challenged.”Former high court judge Vasanti Naik was the chief guest of the inaugural function. Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam and college principal Shrikant Komawar were also present.Delivering the keynote address, Nikam said, “Women have every right to lead a peaceful life and not resign their fate to the never-ending cycle of enduringdomestic violenceand discrimination.”To mark the International Women’s Day, the theme of the law festival is ‘Protection of women against domestic violence’.Nikam said, “Domestic violence is a torturous phenomenon which is not confined to any race, caste or creed. Every country is faced with this problem for which an effective solution should be evolved.”“We advocates, at present, lack depth of knowledge and are therefore losing credibility. Good lawyers should possess qualities like honesty and integrity, backed by deep study of law, to excel in the field,” he said.He said, “The tongue of an advocate is mightier than pen and sword as it can serve punishment to the guilty and set the innocent free. Advocacy is an individualistic art that requires practical and legal training.”In her address, Justice (retd) Naik provided an insight into Domestic Violence Act. There were many central and state laws, but they were inadequate. The Domestic Violence Act, in force since October 26, 2007, is path-breaking, she added.Komawar said, “The sapling of ‘Justa Causa’ was sown 17 years ago and we have tried our best to nurture it. This event has a noble cause of polishing skills of the aspiring lawyers from across the country.”He said 20 teams from premier law institutions are participating in the festival. Activities like moot court, seminar, legal drafting, debate competitions and general quiz will be organized during the period, he added.Chinmayee Nimkhedkar and Mrunmayee Kukdey conducted the inaugural function.

"Dowry harassment cases in Karnataka dip 34%, convictions 100%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dowry-harassment-cases-in-state-dip-34-convictions-100/articleshow/68276768.cms,"Bengaluru news, Bengaluru latest news, Bengaluru news live, Bengaluru news today, Today news Bengaluru, Karnataka,Dowry Harassment,domestic violence,decline,Convictions,cases in Karnataka","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-68282377,imgsize-154910,width-400,resizemode-4/68282377.jpg","BENGALURU:Domestic violenceanddowry harassmentcases against married men or their relatives have reduced drastically in the past six years in the state, according toKarnatakapolice data. The conviction rate has also plummeted.Cases pertaining to domestic violence against women and dowry harassment are registered under IPC Section 498A, titled ‘husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty’.In 2013, a total of 3,187 cases were registered against husbands; the number dipped to 2,102 in 2018. Theconvictionsin the corresponding period fell from 43 to 0.Stakeholders point to different reasons for the trend. According to police, change in family size and lifestyle, including interfaith and intercaste marriages, have hugely contributed to thedecline. “Also, a poor conviction rate discourages women from raising complaints against their husbands. Out-of-court settlements, lack of evidence and victims turning hostile are plaguing the system,” police officers said.TimesViewThe decline in dowry cases is a positive development, given the physical, mental and emotional trauma women have experienced for ages due to the misogynist practice. Though nuclear families, intercaste marriages and police intervention seem to have helped, the figures may not be an accurate representation of the ground reality as some cases still go unreported due to family pressure and social stigma. On the flip side, the anti-dowry law can be a double-edged sword, giving women the scope to misuse it for personal vendetta. While a thorough investigation can help police identify genuine cases, a change in mindset will go a long way in eradicating the menace.Additional director general of police (law and order) Kamal Pant said, “Most dowry harassment cases come from joint families. Women complain against in-laws, sisters-in-law and brothers-in law. Often, the husbands wouldn’t have demanded anything. But others would have tortured the women. Now, nuclear families are increasing and mostly, both husband and wife work.”“Intercaste and interfaith marriages also contribute to the dip. As the marriages would have happened as a matter of choice, the question of dowry doesn’t arise,” he explained.Activists working to help women, however, feel the downtrend in the number of cases doesn’t mean atrocities against married women have reduced.Activists: Registration process delayed“The cases have reduced because women who come with complaints are being tired out due to police delaying the registration of cases. The Supreme Court has relaxed the law without it being amended. The relaxation is being misused by police, who want to do away with registering many cases,” claimed KS Vimala of Janawadi Mahila Sanghatane.However, legal practitioners say unlike earlier, police try to mediate in domestic discord cases and succeed in sending back aggrieved women without registering their complaints.Ambika S, an advocate dealing with dowry harassment cases, said, “Following Supreme Court guidelines, police take stock of the situation before deciding whether to register a domestic violence or dowry harassment case. Complainants who don’t have enough evidence are being sent back. In other cases, police, in good faith, try to reconcile the fighting couple.”Ambika said the dowry menace is still rampant but has acquired different forms like demands for cars, land or even a government job.Activists fighting for men’s rights have welcomed the decline but said women may use other criminal sections like rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act to seek vengeance against their husbands and in-laws.Kumar Jagirdar, a city-based activist for men’s rights, said, “Many dowry cases are to do with vengeance. Realizing that the section is being misused, the Supreme Court laid down guidelines directing police not to act hastily on complaints. But there are instances of women wanting a police case against their husbands and falsely accusing them of sexually assaulting or raping their minor daughter.”"

The incident occurred at around 3.15am on February 20 when three men in a speeding car pulled over outside a café. One of them, who was in the rear seat, drew out his weapon and opened fire at a delivery boy sitting on a chair. The bullet hit the chair, and luckily, no one was hurt. While this was a rare case when there has been a firing, violence at cafés and eateries operating round-the-clock in Jaipur isn’t an uncommon sight; drunken brawls and unruly, rude guests are often seen at such eateries during midnight when crowd gathers after drinking at pubs and clubs.‘PEOPLE THREATEN US BY CITING PERSONAL CONNECTIONS’Sonal Sajwan, food and beverage manager of the restobar Jaipur Adda in Bani Park, that stays open till 1.30-2am, says that while restros that are open till late, have open seating are favoured by customers, they become more accessible to all kinds of people, including miscreants and hooligans. “And you cannot stop someone from walking into your restaurant,” says Sonal. “We do face problems sometimes. At 1 or 2am, our restaurant is often full of guests who are under the influence of alcohol. They threaten us by citing personal connections saying things like, ‘Tu janta nahi mai kaun hoon’, when we ask them for payments. However, our staff is equipped to deal with such situations,” he shares.Eateries atSindhi Campthat stay open till late at night‘WE DEPLOY BOUNCERS AND SECURITY GUARDS TO HANDLE SUCH SITUATIONS’DND Bar and Lounge, situated on the rooftop of Hotel Maharani Prime, Sindhi Camp, is a well-known place where Jaipur’s youngsters, many of them having consumed alcohol, congregate to have food and an after-party of sorts. The place stays open till 6 in the morning. Owner Naveen Bacchani says, “Alcohol is often a key factor in the aggressive behaviour of guests. Not just with our staff, sometimes a violent brawl occurs among the guests themselves. Under the influence of alcohol, it takes no time for a usual verbal spat to escalate into a violent scuffle. On our part, we have installed CCTV cameras at our lounge and have deployed three bouncers and two security guards to tackle this growing problem. When the situation gets out of control, we call the police.”Naveen adds, “We also have some guests who refuse to pay the bill. Recently, we had a customer who came with one of his female friends late at night and both of them ordered drinks. While the female guest left early, the man stayed on for a while and placed an order for some more drinks and snacks. When we asked him for payment, he simply refused and became a bit aggressive with our staff. We had to take the help of the police in this case. We have a zero-tolerance approach towards people who don’t know how to behave.” He further informs that such problems happen mostly at roadside food outlets as compared to rooftops.‘ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS POINTED A GUN AT ME’Rajesh, owner of an eatery which is open till 6am at Sindhi Camp, shares, “There was an incident when one of the customers pointed a gun at me. Problems arise, especially during the weekend when there is a lot of rush. I have noticed that it is mostly the outstation people, settled in Jaipur either for studies or work, who often create troubles and misbehave with us. They live away from their parents. So, they think that they are free to do whatever they want.”He further adds, “I think police patrolling at regular intervals might help in curbing the situation. Even though my staff is trained in crowd management, they are not security.”‘CUSTOMERS HAVE PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED DELIVERY BOYS’Sabir Khan, help desk manager at Muhammadi Palace that stays open till 12-12.30am, says that it is mostly the young boys who misbehave. Also, incidents of violence are not just limited to the restaurant staff. It happens with the delivery boys as well. “We have had incidents where customers have literally snatched food from our delivery boys to avoid paying the money and physically assaulted them. According to our delivery boys, such customers are mostly drunk. At our restaurant, people under the influence of alcohol come and leave without paying the bill. When we try to stop them, they try to do dadagiri. We don’t go to the police because it is quite a hassle and might bring bad reputation to the restaurant. But violence at food outlets is definitely a matter of concern,” he says."

People demanding Reservation must reflect on the moral and ethical dimensions of the problem.”Jayaprakash said that, while there was one section in the country that wanted to extend the benefits of Reservation, while there was another that wanted to put an end to the practice once and for all. “The claim that Reservation is restricted to people from a few castes is false, it is extended to vulnerable sections across the social spectrum including physically-challenged people, etc., based on the proportion of their population,” said Jayaprakash.Pointing to the Dalits continuing to be on the margins of society, Jayaprakash said, “This indicates the persistence of the caste system. Reservation must continue till there is caste.”Political scientist HM Rajashekar called caste a societal ‘malaise’. “Caste has been used by leaders for political mileage. Parties coming to power must focus on providing employment to youngsters,” he said.Special officer for Raichur University Muzaffar Asadi said that the caste system was more prevalent, and deeply entrenched in rural areas than it was in cities. “A Dalit is killed every hour in the country. There are many temples that Dalits are not allowed entry to, and they are banned from drawing water from wells. Reservation must continue till there is caste-related violence,” said Asadi.Head of UoM’s political science department Krishna Hombal, and Prof GT Ramachandrappa participated in the seminar."

If we had imbibed the Constitution’s spirit, which requires us to abjure violence, we would never spill blood over political differences,” he said.“Let us not forget that in the past six decades, since our state was formed, we have been ruled by different governments. They had different political views but all of them dreamed about and worked hard for the state’s progress. The state is today enjoying the legacy handed down to us by many individuals, groups and ideologies, who worked for the society’s welfare,” he added.The progress that Kerala has achieved in terms of human development, especially in literacy, education and health, was the result of the Renaissance movement, which quickened the pace of social transformation, the governor added.“There were many social movements that brought the winds of change and all of them were led by leaders whose words and ideas encouraged people to think and to fight for human dignity. These social and religious leaders had willingly taken up the task of recreating a society, which Swamy Vivekananda had once criticized as a lunatic asylum,” Sathasivam said.Minister for culture, SC/ST and backward communities, A K Balan, minister for fisheries J Mercykutty Amma, mayor V Rajendra Babu, M Mukesh, MLA, district panchayat president C Radhamani, culture secretary Rani George, cultural director T R Sadasivan Nair and others attended the event."

The fire service evacuated the residents and extinguished the blaze. Eleven people, including two fire fighters, suffered minor injuries, the fire service told AFP.A mother of four children, including a nine-month-old baby, told AFP they escaped via the stairs after seeing the fire from their window.Interior minister Christophe Castaner in a tweet accused the arsonists of being ""neither demonstrators, nor trouble-makers"" but ""murderers"".Eighty-two people had been arrested by the early afternoon, the police said.The protests came a day after President Emmanuel Macron arrived in the southwestern Pyrenees mountains with his wife Brigitte for a short ski break, an AFP photographer reported.""I'm going to spend two to three days here to rest and rediscover landscapes and faces that are dear to me,"" Macron told La Depeche du Midi newspaper.Saturday's turnout is a test for the ""yellow vest"" movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes and quickly ballooned into a anti-government rebellion but has struggled lately to mobilise large numbers of protesters.Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17.The rally coincides with the end of the public debates called by President Emmanuel Macron to try take the heat out of the protests and give voters a forum to propose policy changes.Around half a million people turned out at townhall-style meetings held around the country over the past two months.But many ""yellow vests"" dismissed the consultation as a smoke-screen.The police on Saturday used tear gas and water cannon to repel protesters who gathered at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe war memorial, which was sacked by protesters on December 1 in scenes that drew international condemnation.Several news stands also went up in smoke as groups of mostly black-clad demonstrators pelted the security forces with stones and erected barricades.""There are a number of people who have come just to smash things,"" Castaner said, estimating that some 1,500 ""ultra violent"" activists had infiltrated the crowd of ""between 7,000 and 8,000"".On social media, ""yellow vest"" leaders had hinted at the arrival of sympathisers from Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and even Poland.""Macron, we're coming to get you at home,"" some of the protesters chanted, referring to the presidential palace situated near the Champs-Elysees.From early morning protesters began pouring into the capital by train and car from around the country for what they called an ""ultimatum"" to Macron.Over 5,000 police were deployed, along with several armoured police vehicles, and several metro stations were closed.Macron, who was caught off guard when grassroots protesters began occupying traffic roundabouts in November over fuel taxes, has loosened the state's purse strings to the tune of 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) to try defuse the protests.He also travelled the length and breadth of the country, engaging in marathon debates with local politicians and voters.But the measures failed to quell the anger of the demonstrators, who accuse the former investment banker, of being in the pocket of the rich.Laurent Casanova, an engineer who was among the protesters on Saturday, told AFP he wanted to mark the end of the debates.""We have been patient but now we want results,"" he said.The protest was one of several planned in Paris on Saturday, where climate campaigners also gathered in their thousands to demand Macron go further on greening the economy."

It is the world's largest single-dish steerable millimeter-wavelengthtelescopeand is jointly run by the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Mexico's national institute of astrophysics.LMT ""has reduced its scientific activities to a minimum level due to the security problems in the region surrounding the telescope,'' said university spokesman Ed Blaguszewski.""The University of Massachusetts Amherst has suspended travel of UMass personnel to the LMT site, and we have retained security consultants to advise us on security risks in the area and strategies to deal with these risks,'' he said.Mexico's astrophysics institute said in a statement that ``the unsafe conditions that prevail in the region are well known and public.''The other affected site is the HAWC gamma ray and cosmic ray observation facility.

Peter Schloerb, the director of the LMT office for UMass Amherst, declined to give specifics but said ""we had just one incident that precipitated our recent decision.''""No one was harmed, and I don't think that we at LMT are particularly singled out by the criminals,'' Schloerb wrote. ""Nevertheless, we do feel that it is important to review the situation carefully before returning to normal operations.''A Puebla state official who was not authorized to be quoted by name said the only serious incident he was aware of occurred in December, when a person travelling to work with the telescope suffered a carjacking on his way to the site.The state police have since said they will provide escorts for astronomers and telescope personnel.Mexico has suffered a rising tide of homicides, which peaked at 33,341 in 2018, a 15.5 increase over 2017.The violence has affected many areas of public life; 26 priests were killed in Mexico between 2012 and 2018, and even environmental inspectors have been killed after mistakenly stumbling on drug labs.

Otherwise there could be long-standing negative consequences.”Following Loni’s death, protest strikes were observed in Quetta, Balochistan’s capital, and other Pashtun majority area of the volatile province. The PTM claimed that the state was involved in the alleged killing of Loni. Two days ago, at least 18 PTM activists were arrested during a protest outside the Islamabad Press Club.The PTM was formed last year by Pashtun youth from tribal regions after the extra-judicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, a young Pashtun model from Waziristan, in a fake police encounter in Karachi. Ignored completely by the local media and mainstream political parties, for their strong views against the security establishment, the PTM had staged massive protests and rallies in different parts of the country against enforced disappearances, extrajudicial arrests and killings, as well as the mistreatment of the Pashtun community by security forces. “Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai, Iss ke peechay wardi hai” (the uniform is to be blamed for terrorism) is the movement’s main slogan.On Thursday, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi reacted sharply to the Afghan President’s comment and called it as “irresponsible” and a “gross interference” in the internal affairs of the country.“We reject the tweet by President Ashraf Ghani. Such irresponsible statements are only gross interference. Afghan leadership needs to focus on long-standing serious grievances of the Afghan people,” Qureshi posted onTwitter."

Both countries share deep historical, cultural, linguistic, religious and ethnic bonds. They face similar economic challenges"", he said.Bisaria said despite ""roadblocks"", humanitarian and trade exchanges between the two countries must continue.The Indo-Pak ties strained after the terror attacks by Pakistan-based terrorists in 2016 and India's surgical strikes inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The ties further nose-dived in 2017 with no bilateral talks taking place between them.India has been maintaining that terror and talks cannot go together.India remains a popular destination for medical tourists from Pakistan while thousands of members of divided families visit each other. According to a recent World Bank report, trade potential between the two countries stands at $37 billion per annum, he said.""Our common enemies remain poverty, illiteracy and disease and not each other,"" Bisaria said, adding in the long run only sustained peace and shared progress will allow India and Pakistan to focus better on their domestic objectives of prosperity.He further said while the present trade between the two countries stands at around $2 billion, there is room for a leap forward once barriers are broken, in an atmosphere free of distrust and violence.Bisaria said that humanitarian initiatives occupy an important place in building trust between the two countries and the Kartarpur Corridor is one such initiative.To commemorate the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in 2019, the two countries have agreed to build a 'corridor of faith', with modern facilities for smooth visits of Sikh pilgrims from India to the holy shrine at Kartarpur Sahib.""I am certain this vision will drive the relationship between India and Pakistan,"" he said.""It is possible to achieve inclusive economic growth, without sacrificing democracy and diversity, without compromising on the values of pluralism and tolerance, which are the core values of our society,"" said Bisaria."
