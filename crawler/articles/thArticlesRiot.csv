"‘It’s not a wave election, so real issues will matter,’ says Jayant Chaudhary",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/its-not-a-wave-election-so-real-issues-will-matter/article26656693.ece,"
We might be contesting only three seats but every seat is important, says RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The 2019 Lok Sabha election is no less than a matter of survival for the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is contesting in alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party. While the party has zero MLAs and MPs today, it still has a support base in West U.P. especially among the agrarian communities like Jats and will play a key role in determining the performance of the BJP in this sugar-cane belt of Uttar Pradesh. RLD vice-presidentJayant Chaudhary, who orchestrated the Kairana by-poll win last year, speaks about how important the polls are for the party, how a new social coalition is challenging the BJP’s narrative and other burning issues like Balakot, reservations and BJP’s OBC outreach. He is himself contesting from Baghpat, once held by his grandfather, former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, and his father Ajit Singh, who lost in 2014. He spoke toThe Hinduduring his hectic campaign in Baghpat. Excerpts:You are finally stepping into your grandfather’s boots...Rather big boots..Yes, so, how do you see this immediate electoral challenge?You can’t link the election to a legacy. Legacy is about identity. And I think that carries on irrespective of the results. I mean, today RLD’s political significance has waned drastically but it still has significance in terms of the issues. And that’s the real legacy I feel we need to carry forward. There is a big gap in policy perspectives today... what Chaudhary Sahab wanted for rural India.How important is this election in terms of the revival of the RLD?That’s what I’m saying, electoral results can differ. I feel there is a need at the national level to have some sort of a pressure group to work on the issues that Chaudhary Sahab took up. And there is a role for the RLD and there are other parties also in the political matrix today that understand that first and foremost the farmer deserves respect. If we look at just this election, I feel the that the rural distress that is quite visible, that people have felt acutely for the last 4-5 years, has led to large scale disenchantment. So this whole propaganda and personality cult and hype around the supreme leader, will not be as effective as it was in 2014. It’s not a wave election, so real issues will matter, like state of the economy and rural economy, the jobless growth syndrome. Farm wages have dipped, even now the outlook is so bleak that most people are now if you do a poll, — there are surveys being undertaken — they are not seeing their incomes rising for this year or next year. People are perceiving there’s now going to be a dip that’s going to continue for sometime. There is a lack of confidence. These are the prime issues we are going to go and take to the voters. At some level, we will provide an alternative to what’s happened over the five years.The BJP is projecting that it has changed the narrative after Pulwama and Balakot. Do you feel it will impact the voting patterns?Strident nationalism can have short-lived appeal. It can also divert our mind for some time. But after Pulwama and the airstrikes, there’s been some time, some settling down, and people are now beginning to question the government’s policy even on matters of national security. They are aware that even the jawans are not happy. Even a simple thing like One Rank One Pension, which was a big promise, has not really been fulfilled. Then the para forces are asking for rights. So one one hand, the jawan is not happy and also you are seeing increased tension, more incidents happening.It was clearly a security failure that Pulwama happened in the first place. So people are starting to ask those questions. They are saying whatever you do to Pakistan is ok, you have to address the issue, but it is our failing if you are letting the jawans die. There is a real cost to every life for those families who get affected. People have started to ask the questions and that’s the message we will drive home also.What kind of a social math do you have in your favour this time, especially since SP and BSP are with you?It’s a great opportunity for us to build social cohesion. When people vote together, they start thinking together, they start working together. So whatever disharmony exists today in the villages, whether is it on communal lines or ideas around caste identities, I think everything is now fluid. Therefore, whatever traditional vote banks that our parties have worked to build up, they are seamlessly working together. And when they vote together in the next election, that’s the positive thing that’s coming out of this political math.That is good for India. That’s the message we are taking to the country, that India is diverse, one supreme leader can’t fit all situations. It’s not what we need. There is diversity and a number of leaders need to work together on issues. And just like our alliance is able to work together, that’s the formula we need to build up, whereas the BJP has a completely negative campaign, they are talking about building of fear, hype and about Pakistan really more than India in the entire campaign.Do you feel any affect of the Muzaffarnagar riots still exist? The Jats and Muslims were polarized in the last election.In real terms, no. A big level of normalcy has returned to people’s lives. And the lack of faith and confidence in each other, which had dissipated very fast, generations of relations were forgotten in two-three hours of anger. I think now there are some green shoots that have come up. And again it’s come out because of political equations improving. When people voted together in Kairana, immediately they calmed down. So that’s why when an incident like Bulandshahr happened, a lot of us were fearful it could have had adverse impact throughout the region. People could have gone home and said, ‘Dekho, they are trying to attacks us.’ I mean, it could have led to follow on incidents, which it did not.So you feel there is a sense of calm in the area and a repeat won’t happen?Repeat won’t happen and also the BJP keeps talking about riots and Kairana exodus, and those sort of same negative issues. It’s not going to yield any political benefit. It’s going to work against them.Are you happy with the support of the SP BSP? Their cadre and leadership.I’m quite pleased. I had a very constructive meeting with Mayawatiji. And she spoke at length about the need to work together and to transfer those people who have allegiance to our organization in favour of our alliance partners. In front of me she had conversations with her people in Mathura, where she gave them some directions. I’m quite happy. At the top level, there is comfort with each other. There are no ego clashes. It’s quite remarkable how we were able to strike such an arrangement, quite a complex feat to have three parties able to hammer out a seat arrangement. It’s unprecedented. That’s happened quite smoothly and even now, our workers, without us having had to formally send out messages, they have already started doing informal meetings together. Every district in U.P. has had meetings where BSP, SP and our leaders have come together on one platform.Is this also an election where you need to revive the faith of the Jats in your leadership? You have the support of the alliance this time.It is an opportunity for us to build on our past successes and our identity. Re-build in some measure and to re-brand ourselves. Because now we are working with people we have not worked with before perhaps, so we have an opportunity and a platform to tell them what we are about. Our circle of influence in that respect is growing. We might be contesting only three seats but every seat is important. When we are working in this equation in different social segments, that are demographically important, we have a unique opportunity to build faith in these people.But will your votes transfer to the SP and BSP?I think they will. Our people are politically very aware. They are seeing what’s happening. They are very angry with the BJP. And traditionally our vote base is farmers, and when we talk about rural distress, the farmer vote is going to get very important in this election. Their vote will be against BJP but also for us. It will also be a positive vote for the alliance because it believes that now they can win. Once our voter thinks that RLD is in the big frame of things and is going to be able to get its policies implemented, they will vote for us. Whether it’s our symbol or that of SP or BSP, doesn’t matter. People have realized that Rashtriya Lok Dal is part of an important political matrix and the most important political alliance in the country. Therefore, there is a belief that whatever issues we have stood for, in the last many years, that is going to be the part of the political mainstream thought going forward. That sense of confidence will help us transfer our votes.Is there a dissatisfaction over the seats allotted to you? Three could have been four or five?Of course, it could have been. We could have always asked for more. But like I said you take one step at a time.There is a section of the electorate, especially the non-Yadav OBCs, who don't really seem too enthused by this alliance. And the BJP claims it has a strong hold over them.The BJP is very clever. They are the most casteist party and they brand us as caste parties. They will try their best to brand the Samajwadi Party as a Yadav party, we are always Jats and Mayawati is the leader of one caste. That’s a part of their political propaganda and strategy. If we look at what the government has done, who is suffering the most, it’s the most poorer sections of our country. Dalits have faced a lot of atrocities. They face a government that has been using the courts when it wants very conveniently to target the Dalits. In the universities our educated people are not getting enough opportunities because of this bias, whether it’s the UGC, the government or the courts.Institutionally, they are being barred from taking part in the mainstream. An insecurity is building up. This government said it would embolden and strengthen the National Commission for Backward Castes, give it constitutional status. It’s been eight months they still haven’t appointed a chairperson to the constitutional body that’s supposed to look after the welfare of the Backward community. It’s a lot of lip-service. They were talking about bifurcating the Backward quota at the State and national levels. That still hasn’t happened. Those communities, like Saini, Kashyap Prajapati they haven’t got their share. Whether it’s reservation policy or any other special scheme that’s formulated for Backward sections. It is true they have not got their share. That correction needs to happen . But BJP is not giving them that either.Is there any strategy you have in the campaign to woo these communities?This campaign is going to be more about macros issues for us. We are talking about the constitution, how important it is in a democracy to tolerate other views and belief systems. Then we are talking about the farmers. These are all issues, the economy, that will impact at the micro level the Backward, Dalit, all of these populations. Reservation could be one issue that we could take up. And there have been some political movements whether it was the roster issue, where we spoke out, SP did too. Tejaswi [Yadav] is also doing this whole movement in Bihar.How will the 10 per cent reservation impact the election?No, because... (a) there is still a doubt what position the courts will take.(b) EWS certificate are not easy to get made. There are several encumbrances at the State level when a young man goes to get that certificate. It’s not very clear who is entitled and who is not. And when you are talking of reservations on economic basis, in a sense it’s a big question mark on the policy that we have been having in place in this country with the Mandal system. So it’s not really had that impact. BJP thought it could use this and go to people who are against reservation, and say that now we have shifted to economic criteria and this is the first step. And go to people who have not got benefits to say now we have given you a tool that you can also take benefits. I think that communication is not very clear.The eight-lakh criteria — you can’t compare a farmer with 5 acre land holding and a person with eight lakh income in the city. It’s muddled thinking. They didn’t think it through. The social justice ministry in this same session of Parliament, said it has no plans to introduce any EWS quota. It’s very clear, this government, there are concepts, ideas and policies that get pushed, framed and implemented without enough debate on them. So it leads to shoddy work.Do you feel that because there is so much of emphasis on Narendra Modi’s image and persona, that the entire election is about him. The PM face becomes an important factor here and the Opposition has a disadvantage in that aspect?We have been raising how important it is to have a cabinet. People can’t name more than two three ministers in this government. That’s not a real political leadership at any level.But electorally does that appeal the people?People are simplistic in their thinking. They want that sense of a strong leader taking care of everything. But I think a certain level of maturity has crept in also and their experience with this experiment hasn’t worked out. They thought having a stronger majoritarian government would help them and they have seen that if you give the wrong person the reins of the country and too much power, it will corrupt him like anything. They have seen dangers of that. So therefore now again if they go to the people saying you need an even stronger Modi, people will say what for. We gave you an opportunity, you were so strong."

SC to hear Sajjan Kumar’s bail plea in riots case on April 8,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-to-hear-sajjan-kumars-bail-plea-in-riots-case-on-april-8/article26638514.ece,"
Justice Khanna recuses himself from hearing the matter
",,"The Supreme Court on Monday said that bail plea of former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, who was sentenced to life term in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, will be heard on April 8 after Justice Sanjiv Khanna once again recused himself from hearing the matter.On February 25, Justice Khanna had recused himself from hearing Kumar’s plea when he was sitting in a Bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi.The 73-year-old Kumar has also challenged in the top court the Delhi High Court’s December 17, 2018, verdict awarding him life imprisonment for the “remainder of his natural life” in the case.The case in which Kumar was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment’s Raj Nagar Part-I of southwest Delhi on November 1 and 2, 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.Anti-Sikh riots had broken out after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.Kumar’s application seeking bail in the case came up for hearing on Monday before a Bench comprising Justices S.A. Bobde and Sanjiv Khanna. “List the instant application for bail on April 8 before a Bench of which one of us (Sanjiv Khanna) is not a member,” the Bench said in its order.Surrendered in 2018Kumar had surrendered before a trial court here on December 31, 2018, to serve the sentence in pursuance of the High Court’s December 17 verdict. After his conviction in the case, Kumar had resigned from the Congress.The CBI has recently told the apex court that Kumar’s plea seeking bail in the case should be dismissed as he has a “large political clout” and is capable of “influencing or terrorising” witnesses in the case pending against him. It has told the court that fair trial in the pending case would not be possible if Kumar is granted bail.The top court had earlier admitted Kumar’s appeal for hearing and had also issued notice to the CBI on his bail plea seeking its response.The High Court had convicted and sentenced Kumar to spend the remainder of his life in jail for the offences of criminal conspiracy and abetment in commission of crimes of murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony and defiling and destruction of a Gurudwara.It had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by a trial court to five others — former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and ex-MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar."
CSJP urges voters to reject 'pseudo-nationalism',https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/csjp-urges-voters-to-reject-pseudo-nationalism/article26652476.ece,,,"Goa Church-affiliated Council for Social Justice and Peace (CSJP) has urged the electorate to reject the terror of 'pseudo-nationalism' and to take on the corrupt, defectors and political opportunists.The statement was issued in Panaji on Tuesday by Fr. Savio Fernandes, Executive Secretary of the social wing of Goa Chruch.“Let us also give corrupt defectors and opportunists the due electoral response. Let us not be carried away by petty and trivial issues but think of the overall interest of the nation and of our State,” Fr. Fernandes said in his statement.“When rightful and timely information is denied, reports and surveys tweaked to suppress inconvenient facts, critical dissent crushed by labeling it as anti-national and as urban naxalism, when hoodlums run riot on streets in the guise of nationalism – the defensive counterclaims of “no corruption” and ‘scam free governance’ become totally hollow,” the Council further said, while also raising issues related to cow vigilantism, love-jihad and “other forms of cultural extremism”.On Goa politics, CSJP said that political defections were tearing at the very fabric of democracy while urging people not to vote for defectors.“Another evil is the blatant engineering of defections in violation of the people’s mandate. Moreover, persons who deceive and betray people’s trust should have no scope in democracy,” the statement said."

Grand alliances are always formed post polls: Yechury,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/grand-alliances-are-always-formed-post-polls-yechury/article26637702.ece,"
Formation of alternative government imminent, he says ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Communist Party of India (Marxist) national general secretary Sitaram Yechury said ‘Mahagatbandhan’ or the grand alliance would come into picture only post elections and it was imminent that an alternative government would be formed.He was addressing a gathering of party activists at Governorpet here before party leader Ch. Babu Rao headed to file nomination for the Vijayawada Central Assembly seat representing the Jana Sena-CPI(M)-CPI-BSP alliance.On grand alliance, Mr. Yechury said, “Never in the past were grand alliances formed before the elections at the national level. Only at the State level, allies come together before elections. Since 1977 all coalitions had been formed only after the elections and in the same way in 2019 the grand alliance will take shape and form an alternative government.”Stressing on defeating the BJP, he said in the past five years people of all walks of life except the 1% rich had been burdened in one or other way. Unemployment, poverty, corruption, farmers’ suicides, communal riots and many others plagued the country.‘Chowkidar’ a diversionary tacticHe said the ‘Chowkidar’ campaign started by the BJP was only to divert the attention of the people from its failures. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had been narrating stories, must be dethroned, he said.He said Mr. Modi owed many answers to the people. “All the parties condemned terrorists after the Pulwama attack and appreciated the airstrike in Pakistan. Questions were raised only after the BJP started politicising the issue and reaping benefit out of it. And anyone who questioned it was branded as anti-national.” The BJP wanted to divert people from actual issues before going for polls and win again.Mr. Yechury said the rendezvous had reminded him of the party’s most active days 20 years ago and expressed confidence that Mr. Rao would win the election this time."

Elderly disillusioned, care little for polarisation in Nawada, Gaya constituencies
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"An animated political discussion is under way among a group of young men in Kharidi Bigha village in Nawada parliamentary constituency. Firebrand Bharatiya Janata Party leader and sitting MP Giriraj Singh has been asked to contest from the Begusarai seat. Alliance partner Lok Janshakti Party has announced the name of Chandan Kumar Singh, brother of don-turned-politician Suraj Bhan Singh, as the National Democratic Alliance’s candidate from the constituency.One of the young men says, “The BJP has committed a major mistake by shifting Giriraj Singh from here. He could have easily retained the Nawada seat.” “Nawada has come alive ever since Giriraj Singh came here. Instead of crime, politics in Nawada [has] revolved around Hindu pride [since then],” Manish Kumar (25) tellsThe Hindu.What’s wanted most, though, is employment. Did Mr. Singh bring any factory or developmental project to Nawada? “No, not really, but at least he was socially connected and available to us,” Raju Kumar (24) and Shib Kumar (26) respond immediately.‘PM’s reflection’Some of Kharidi Bigha’s men work as waiters in Kerala, some have migrated to find employment in the unorganised sectors of Delhi and Jammu. For them, Mr. Singh is a political reflection of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How? “He, too, talks about the pride of country and of Hindutva. Earlier, no politician had raised such issues, which are essentials of life,” they say.The group swells to a dozen and a mention of the Balakot air strike leads to animated responses, some in unison. Comments include: “Only a Prime Minister like Narendra Modi could have done this. Country should come first for every Indian, before any other issue.” But will they vote for the BJP because of the air strike? “Yes, yes, yes…has it [the air strike] been done before?” they ask in one voice.What about the BJP’s alliance partner in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar? “ He has lost all his political credibility. One doesn’t know [to] which side he will make his next move. He is apaltimar mukhyamantri(turncoat Chief Minister),” says Neeraj Kumar (22). He is a Kurmi, the same Other Backward Class (OBC) to which Mr. Kumar belongs.But Mohammad Shagir Alam, a motorcyle mechanic from Ansar Nagar, a village under the Bundelkhand police station, says, “Ever since Giriraj Singh came to Nawada, this district has been completely polarised between Hindus and Muslims. We don’t feel safe now, we don’t venture out late in the evening, nobody knows what will happen. The situation was not like this before.”Last year during Ram Navami festival, there was a riot-like situation at the town’s Sadhbavna Chowk and curfew was imposed for some hours. It was alleged that Mr. Singh visited those arrested in the case in jail. “It’s frightening for people like us, who eke out their livelihood on a daily basis,” adds Mr. Alam.Nawada has 9.27% Muslim voters, while upper caste Bhumihars (the community to which Mr. Singh belongs) and Yadavs make up 12.06% and 16.69% respectively.Unimpressed citizensElderly voters in Madho Bigha, Bhadauni and Akbarpur feel neither Mr. Kumar’s government nor Mr. Singh have done anything for them.“We are farmers. Will we eat national pride in the name of Hindutva? Social cohesion is more important than all these animosities prevailing between two communities in Nawada today,” they tellThe Hindu.“Nothing has been done for farmers’ welfare,” says Ram Briksha Singh, a Bhumihar farmer.A group of farmers are seen reading a Hindi newspaper in the afternoon sun by the roadside at Ganjas village in the neighbouring constituency of Gaya. When asked about the welfare schemes launched by the NDA government for the farmers, Surendra Yadav, Rajendra Chaudhury, Ram Vilas Singh, Subodh Rajak and Durga Paswan laugh out aloud and say, “We are yet to get the ₹6,000 that the Modi government has announced. Officials at the local block office need a lot of papers and when we go with the papers, the Internet connection fails, only to be restored past midnight.”They also rue that the government is taking away their agricultural land “forcibly” for the construction of a railway yard at nearby Bandhua.Dharmendra Kumar, Sudhir Kumar, Vikas Kumar and their friends, students of Gaya College, are rooting for Mr. Modi. “We will vote for PM Modi, not for any local candidate. Modi must be given a second chance,” says Dharmendar Kumar. To the question whether that would help them secure employment, Vikas Kumar says, “Gulami se acchha berojgari hai(it is better to be unemployed than to be a slave).”“Every day Pakistan sends terrorists to our country. They kill our soldiers and innocent men. For how long will we tolerate this? Only a PM like Modi can give them a fitting reply,” they say in unison.Under the alliance’s seat adjustment, Gaya has gone to the Janata Dal-United kitty this time, with sitting BJP MP Hari Manjhi replaced by JD(U)’s Vijay Manjhi. The Gaya constituency has 20.24% Yadav, 14.02% Musahar (Dalit) and 13.6% Muslim voters. Both Nawada and Gaya go to the polls on April 11."

RLD leader banking on social arithmetic of Jatav-Jat-Muslim in riot-hit district, but faces an uphill task
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“Do you recognise me? I fought nine parliamentary elections, with both wins and losses. But why have I come to Muzaffarnagar to contest election, you tell me?”The question is directed at an audience of men and boys gathered around a Ravidas temple, a place of worship for Dalits, in Ladwa, a village in western Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district.There are Dalits, Muslims, Jats, and OBC communities like Kashyaps/Dheevar in the audience, most of whom are seated on neatly arranged red plastic chairs or standing in clusters.Their eyes are locked at the makeshift stage, dressed in banners of three parties — Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal — where a bespectacled man wearing a white kurta-pyjama is standing holding the microphone.“I have come to Muzaffarnagar because you are responsible for bringing the BJP to power. You fought with each other and destroyed thebhaichara[brotherhood]. As a result of that you have to bear Modi today,” he says.New challengeNow 80, RLD chief Ajit Singh has had many ups and downs in his political career, but facing a steep downward curve since 2013, perhaps the stakes have never been higher for his party as they are in the 2019 election.Moving out from his traditional seat of Baghpat, Mr. Singh has played a gamble by deciding to contest from Muzaffarnagar, a constituency which was marred by communal violence in 2013, triggering a communal polarisation which eventually helped the BJP sweep the State.While he has an uphill task to overturn the deficit from 2014, when the BJP’s Sanjeev Balyan secured a massive 6.53 lakh votes (58.98%), his fight is bolstered by the support of the SP and the BSP. Mr. Singh is going from village to village addressing nukkad sabhas to connect with his new electorate in the sugar belt.“You want to bear Modi for five more years,” he asks the crowd at Ladwa. Some of them reply: “No, not any more.” Mr. Singh then says: “Maintain your bhaichara, and Modi will disappear. You did that in Kairana, didn’t the BJP lose?”The 2013 communal violence demolished the RLD’s carefully stitched decades old Jat-Muslim coalition. The results were clear in 2014; Mr. Singh himself stood a humiliating third from his bastion Baghpat.The Hindufollowed Mr. Singh through his nukkad sabhas and found most of his attacks targeted at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, backed by his desire to restore the RLD’s lost social coalition. “Just defeating Modi won’t do. You will have to bury him. You will have to uproot him,” he tells the crowd, his fist smacking the air passionately.The audience bursts into claps and shouts of “Chaudhary Ajit Singh zindabad” resonating in the open venue. “Modi, yourachhe dinare gone, ourachhe dinare coming,” he declares.Local supportAfter the sabha is over, Mr. Singh moves into his SUV and the cavalcade drives past sugarcane and wheat fields and reaches the house of a prominent RLD old-timer, a farmer, to pacify him. To secure his win, Mr. Singh would require to revive support of all such disgruntled loyalists and the farmer, despite not being in the best of health, is convinced to address a nukkad sabha for Mr. Singh at the next location, Titavi. Along the way, drum beats, shower of flowers and handshakes welcome the Jat veteran.At Titavi, explains to people the economic downfall caused by the riots and how the local steel rod factories are still shut. “I want to bring Muzaffarnagar back to the same position where it was before the riots,” he says.With the SP and BSP in alliance with the RLD, Mr. Singh has ensured consolidation of the Jatavs and Muslims, with the latter itself making up for 41% of the district population. That the combined vote of the SP, BSP and RLD in each of the five Assembly segments of Muzaffarnagar in 2017 polls had crossed 50% also presents a hope for him.However, to ensure a victory and galvanise his party, he faces the challenge of reviving his appeal among the Jats, a section of whom are still inclined towards Mr. Modi and Mr. Balyan, who himself is a local Jat.To woo them, Mr. Singh focuses on issue of cane dues, menace of stray cattle and joblessness, and accuses the BJP of trying to divide the country in the name of the Army, which also recruits from the Jat community.Farmers’ woesThe RLD chief strikes a chord with Virendra Singh, a Jat farmer listening patiently in the crowd. Virendra complains that the rate of milk and cattle have fallen under the BJP rule. Another Jat, Rajendra Singh, hits out at Mr. Modi over the unemployment issue, while farmer Soraj Singh, a traditional RLD voter, regrets voting for the BJP in 2014 due to the riots. “All they did was increase the power tariff. Even if the BJP fields a Jat, we will vote for Chaudhary ji,” says Soraj.Raj Kumar, a Jatav, also speaks against the BJP. “We are fed up of BJP. I lost Rs. 80,000 during demonetisation.”A few kilometres away in Kutba village, the opinion is, however, split, with many Jats still supporting Mr. Modi and happy to see the back of the previous Muslim MPs from Muzaffarnagar. Current MP Sanjeev Balyan hails from Kutba, which along with its adjoining village Kutbi, witnessed eight deaths during the 2013 violence.While young Akshay Kumar praises the sitting MP for building metalled roads, widening the canal track and setting up solar panels, Randheer Singh, a farmer, is happy with the Rs. 2,000 he received under the PM KISAN scheme. They also praise the Balakot air strikes, with one local comparing Mr. Modi to a patriotic king.Parveen Balyan, who works at a local sugar mill, compares the alliance partners to “thieves” ganging up against Mr. Modi. He also questions Mr. Singh for choosing Muzaffarnagar. “For 20 years he was a Minister and an MP but what work did he do?” asks Parveen.Like a section of Jats, OBC groups like Kashyaps, Dheevars and Julahas, and upper castes are also tilted towards the BJP. “We don’t care about the candidate, we want BJP,” says Sonu, a Julaha, in Dhindhawali. His namesake, Sonu, a Rohilla Rajput, admits Mr. Singh has the arithmetic to back up a strong fight but still expects the BJP to win. “All I want is a strong government, a BJP government,” he says."

RLD leader banking on social arithmetic of Jatav-Jat-Muslim in riot-hit constituency, but faces an uphill task
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“Do you recognise me? I fought nine parliamentary elections, with both wins and losses. But why have I come to Muzaffarnagar to contest election, you tell me?”The question is directed at an audience of men and boys gathered around a Ravidas temple, a place of worship for Dalits, in Ladwa, a village in western Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district.There are Dalits, Muslims, Jats, and OBC communities like Kashyaps/Dheevar in the audience, most of whom are seated on neatly arranged red plastic chairs or standing in clusters.Their eyes are locked at the makeshift stage, dressed in banners of three parties — Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal — where a bespectacled man wearing a white kurta-pyjama is standing holding the microphone.“I have come to Muzaffarnagar because you are responsible for bringing the BJP to power. You fought with each other and destroyed thebhaichara[brotherhood]. As a result of that you have to bear Modi today,” he says.New challengeNow 80, RLD chief Ajit Singh has had many ups and downs in his political career, but facing a steep downward curve since 2013, perhaps the stakes have never been higher for his party as they are in the 2019 election.Moving out from his traditional seat of Baghpat, Mr. Singh has played a gamble by deciding to contest from Muzaffarnagar, a constituency which was marred by communal violence in 2013, triggering a communal polarisation which eventually helped the BJP sweep the State.While he has an uphill task to overturn the deficit from 2014, when the BJP’s Sanjeev Balyan secured a massive 6.53 lakh votes (58.98%), his fight is bolstered by the support of the SP and the BSP. Mr. Singh is going from village to village addressing nukkad sabhas to connect with his new electorate in the sugar belt.“You want to bear Modi for five more years,” he asks the crowd at Ladwa. Some of them reply: “No, not any more.” Mr. Singh then says: “Maintain your bhaichara, and Modi will disappear. You did that in Kairana, didn’t the BJP lose?”The 2013 communal violence demolished the RLD’s carefully stitched decades old Jat-Muslim coalition.

You will have to bury him. You will have to uproot him,” he tells the crowd, his fist smacking the air passionately.The audience bursts into claps and shouts of “Chaudhary Ajit Singh zindabad” resonating in the open venue. “Modi, yourachhe dinare gone, ourachhe dinare coming,” he declares.The Jat leader also uses witty one-liners to mock Mr. Modi on his persona and track-record, evoking laughter from the rural audience. “Bhaiya, if he [Mr. Modi] goes to Sri Lanka, he would return and say, I killed Ravan.”Another one-liner which generates a louder response from the audience is: “People say Modi lies a lot. He doesn’t lie, he just never speaks the truth.”Local supportAfter the sabha is over, Mr. Singh moves into his SUV and is quickly escorted away to a local supporter’s house where fruits have been laid out for his welcome. Saying no to hospitality is not an option in this part of western Uttar Pradesh, even though Mr. Singh is an hour behind schedule.After a quick interval, the cavalcade drives past sugarcane and wheat fields and reaches the house of a prominent RLD old-timer, a farmer, to pacify him. To secure his win, Mr. Singh would require to revive support of all such disgruntled loyalists and the farmer, despite not being in the best of health, is convinced to address a nukkad sabha for Mr. Singh at the next location, Titavi. Along the way, drum beats, shower of flowers and handshakes welcome the Jat veteran.At Titavi, Mr. Singh once again presses for communal unity among his core constituencies. He also explains to people the economic downfall caused by the riots and how the local steel rod factories are still shut. “I want to bring Muzaffarnagar back to the same position where it was before the riots,” he says.With the SP and BSP in alliance with the RLD, Mr. Singh has ensured consolidation of the Jatavs and Muslims, with the latter itself making up for 41% of the district population.

They also praise the Balakot air strikes, with one local comparing Mr. Modi to a patriotic king.As the conversation shifts to the battle between the RLD and the BJP and economic issues, divisions emerge, a sharp contrast from 2013 when Jats rallied heavily behind the BJP amid communal polarisation.Pushpendra Kumar, a farmer, praises the air strike, but is tilted towards the RLD and regrets voting for the BJP in 2014. He is aggrieved by stray cows which are eating his wheat crop and forcing him to spend money on fencing his 23-bigha field. “Ajit Singh is more sympathetic towards the farmers,” says Pushpendra, blaming Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for “letting loose the cows.Parveen Balyan, who works at a local sugar mill, compares the alliance partners to “thieves” ganging up against Mr. Modi. He also questions Mr. Singh for choosing Muzaffarnagar instead of Baghpat. “For 20 years he was a Minister and an MP but what work did he do?” asks Parveen. But he believes that Mr. Singh will give a tough fight this time, and predicts a low victory margin of 20,000 votes for the BJP.Like a section of Jats, OBC groups like Kashyaps, Dheevars and Julahas, and upper castes are also tilted towards the BJP. “We don’t care about the candidate, we want BJP,” says Sonu, a Julaha, in Dhindhawali village.

Older voters are disillusioned, care little for polarisation of this volatile constituency
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"An animated political discussion is under way among a group of young men in Kharidi Bigha village in Nawada parliamentary constituency. Firebrand Bharatiya Janata Party leader and sitting MP Giriraj Singh has been asked to contest from the Begusarai seat. Alliance partner Lok Janshakti Party has announced the name of Chandan Kumar Singh, brother of don-turned-politician Suraj Bhan Singh, as the National Democratic Alliance’s candidate from the constituency.One of the young men says, “The BJP has committed a major mistake by shifting Giriraj Singh from here. He could have easily retained the Nawada seat.” “Nawada has come alive ever since Giriraj Singh came here. Instead of crime, politics in Nawada [has] revolved around Hindu pride [since then],” Manish Kumar (25) tellsThe Hindu.What’s wanted most, though, is employment. Did Mr. Singh bring any factory or developmental project to Nawada? “No, not really, but at least he was socially connected and available to us,” Raju Kumar (24) and Shib Kumar (26) respond immediately.‘PM’s reflection’Some of Kharidi Bigha’s men work as waiters in Kerala, some have migrated to find employment in the unorganised sectors of Delhi and Jammu. For them, Mr. Singh is a political reflection of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How? “He, too, talks about the pride of country and of Hindutva. Earlier, no politician had raised such issues, which are essentials of life,” they say.The group swells to a dozen and a mention of the Balakot air strike leads to animated responses, some in unison. Comments include: “Only a Prime Minister like Narendra Modi could have done this. Country should come first for every Indian, before any other issue.” But will they vote for the BJP because of the air strike? “Yes, yes, yes…has it [the air strike] been done before?” they ask in one voice.What about the BJP’s alliance partner in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar? “ He has lost all his political credibility. One doesn’t know [to] which side he will make his next move. He is apaltimar mukhyamantri(turncoat Chief Minister),” says Neeraj Kumar (22). He is a Kurmi, the same Other Backward Class (OBC) to which Mr. Kumar belongs.But Mohammad Shagir Alam, a motorcyle mechanic from Ansar Nagar, a village under the Bundelkhand police station, says, “Ever since Giriraj Singh came to Nawada, this district has been completely polarised between Hindus and Muslims. We don’t feel safe now, we don’t venture out late in the evening, nobody knows what will happen. The situation was not like this before.”Last year during Ram Navami festival, there was a riot-like situation at the town’s Sadhbavna Chowk and curfew was imposed for some hours. It was alleged that Mr. Singh visited those arrested in the case in jail. “It’s frightening for people like us, who eke out their livelihood on a daily basis,” adds Mr. Alam.Nawada has 9.27% Muslim voters, while upper caste Bhumihars (the community to which Mr. Singh belongs) and Yadavs make up 12.06% and 16.69% respectively.Unimpressed citizensElderly voters in Madho Bigha, Bhadauni and Akbarpur feel neither Mr. Kumar’s government nor Mr. Singh have done anything for them.“We are farmers. Will we eat national pride in the name of Hindutva? Social cohesion is more important than all these animosities prevailing between two communities in Nawada today,” they tellThe Hindu.“Nothing has been done for farmers’ welfare,” says Ram Briksha Singh, a Bhumihar farmer.A group of farmers are seen reading a Hindi newspaper in the afternoon sun by the roadside at Ganjas village in the neighbouring constituency of Gaya. When asked about the welfare schemes launched by the NDA government for the farmers, Surendra Yadav, Rajendra Chaudhury, Ram Vilas Singh, Subodh Rajak and Durga Paswan laugh out aloud and say, “We are yet to get the Rs. 6,000 that the Modi government has announced. Officials at the local block office need a lot of papers and when we go with the papers, the Internet connection fails, only to be restored past midnight.”They also rue that the government is taking away their agricultural land “forcibly” for the construction of a railway yard at nearby Bandhua.Dharmendra Kumar, Sudhir Kumar, Vikas Kumar and their friends, students of Gaya College, are rooting for Mr. Modi. “We will vote for PM Modi, not for any local candidate. Modi must be given a second chance,” says Dharmendar Kumar. To the question whether that would help them secure employment, Vikas Kumar says, “Gulami se acchha berojgari hai(it is better to be unemployed than to be a slave).”“Every day Pakistan sends terrorists to our country. They kill our soldiers and innocent men. For how long will we tolerate this? Only a PM like Modi can give them a fitting reply,” they say in unison.Under the alliance’s seat adjustment, Gaya has gone to the Janata Dal-United kitty this time, with sitting BJP MP Hari Manjhi replaced by JD(U)’s Vijay Manjhi. The Gaya constituency has 20.24% Yadav, 14.02% Musahar (Dalit) and 13.6% Muslim voters. Both Nawada and Gaya go to the polls on April 11."

Silvana Imam raps and Sweden listens,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/silvana-imam-raps-and-sweden-listens/article26629292.ece,"
The rapper from a refugee family has become the symbol of counterreaction to right-wing populism
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On a recent Friday night, Swedish rapper Silvana Imam appeared on stage at Annexet, a concert venue in the south side of Stockholm, dressed like a comic-book villain. Her face hidden by a black mask studded with spikes, she dragged a metal baseball bat across the stage to the loud cheers of her mostly female audience.The menacing display was a theatrical embodiment of the gleefully confrontational role Ms. Imam, the lesbian daughter of refugees, has come to play in Swedish pop culture. Ms. Imam, whose mother is Lithuanian and father Syrian, is one of the country’s best-known hip-hop artists and a symbol of the counterreaction to the rise of right-wing populism in Scandinavia’s most-populous country.When the mask came off, Ms. Imam, 32, launched intoI Min Zon(In My Zone), a languid, withering song from her first EP, in which she rails against racism and sexism in the country. “Fifteen million people in the world are named Mohamed,” she rapped in Swedish, “but whose name do they want to see on the résumé?”Mattias Naxe, 30, a lighting designer in the audience, said he was drawn to Ms. Imam’s music primarily because she was a “very good rapper,” but added that her success was also a reflection of Sweden’s polarised political climate. In last fall’s national election, the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats won 18% of the vote, making them the country’s third-largest party. “She came at the right time,” he said, adding that she “very much” represents this particular moment.Although Sweden is known for being one of the world’s premier suppliers of dance-pop, it also has one of Europe’s most vibrant hip-hop scenes. Ms. Imam is one of its biggest female stars. In 2014, her breakout singleMs. Imam, a political song in which she refers to herself as a “176 centimeter Pussy Riot,” reached No. 1 in the Swedish charts.Since then, she has won numerous awards, including a Swedish Grammi, the country’s equivalent to a Grammy Award, for artist of the year.Social concernsHer most recent album,Helig Moder(“Holy Mother”), released in February, has been widely praised in the Swedish news media, and she was recently announced as the opening act for the main stage of the renowned Roskilde Music Festival in Denmark.Although Sweden is often seen internationally as a paragon of social liberalism, many of Ms. Imam’s songs have highlighted the racism, misogyny and homophobia she believes permeate society here.NY Times"

The Bench said the case would now come up for hearing after two weeks.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Supreme Court judge Justice Sanjiv Khanna on Monday once again recused himself from hearing the appeal of former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar who has challenged the Delhi High Court verdict sentencing him to life term in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.On February 25, Justice Khanna had recused himself from hearing Kumar’s appeal when he was sitting in a Bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi.The matter came up for hearing on March 25 before a Bench of Justices S.A. Bobde and Sanjiv Khanna.The Bench said the case would now come up for hearing after two weeks.The case in which Kumar was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment’s Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1 and 2, 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.Anti-Sikh riots had broken out after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.73-year-old Kumar had surrendered before a trial court in New Delhi on December 31, 2018, to serve the sentence in pursuance of the High Court’s December 17 judgment awarding him life imprisonment for the “remainder of his natural life”.After his conviction in the case, Kumar had resigned from the Congress party.The CBI has recently told the apex court that Kumar’s plea seeking bail in the matter should be dismissed as he has a “large political clout” and is capable of “influencing or terrorising” witnesses in the case pending against him.It has told the court that fair trial in the pending case would not be possible if Kumar is granted bail.The top court had earlier admitted Kumar’s appeal for hearing and had also issued notice to the CBI on his bail plea seeking its response.The High Court had convicted and sentenced Kumar to spend the remainder of his life in jail for the offences of criminal conspiracy and abetment in commission of crimes of murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony and defiling and destruction of a Gurdwara.It had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by a trial court to five others — former Congress Councillor Balwan Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and ex-MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar.In its judgment, the high court had noted that over 2,700 Sikhs were killed in the national capital during the 1984 riots which was indeed a “carnage of unbelievable proportions”.It had said the riots were a “crime against humanity” perpetrated by those who enjoyed “political patronage” and aided by an “indifferent” law enforcement agency.The High Court had set aside the trial court’s 2010 verdict which had acquitted Kumar in the case."

Karan Kulkarni makes his composing debut for the film with a delightfully quirky mix of genres says Vipin Nair
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Karan Kulkarni composes a soundtrack that perfectly mirrors the spoofy, unabashedly loony nature ofMard Ko Dard Nahi Hota(MKDNH). For a large part, two of the most “regular” sounding songs both involve the fabulous sounding debutant singer Kamakshi Rai. Incidentally, it’s one of the many high points of the soundtrack, as most of the names involved are relatively new. Rai has Vishal Mishra (composer of albums likeVeere Di WeddingandQarib Qarib Singlle, and nowNotebook) for company in the smouldering ‘Tere Liye’. It’s the album’s quietest song penned by Santanu Ghatak, composer-lyricist of the brilliant ‘Rafu’ fromTumhari Sulu.Both singers deliver splendidly even as Kulkarni composes a haunting, immersive soundscape. Rai does a fine job of her solo act, the retro jazz-flavoured ‘Dreamtime’. Kulkarni, doubling up as a lyricist here, manages to capture all that one expects from a number like this. But the real icing on the cake is Rai’s coquettish delivery. ‘Nakhrewaali’, an apparent ode to the leading lady — starts off sounding like an ambient electronic piece, before the percussion elements (Sanket Naik) kick in. The number is progressively brilliant, seguing from brass band to South Indian, I particularly loved the use ofedakkaandkanjira. Another brilliant touch is the use of Omkar Dhumal’sshehnailike a saxophone. Kulkarni gets behind the mic for this one, with a whispery cameo from Saba Azad. It makes one wish that Azad’s portion was longer, it’s a pity she doesn’t get more songs in Bollywood.Before composingMKDNH’s soundtrack Kulkarni last worked on the background score forTumhari Sulu(2017). Kulkarni gets hisSuludirector Suresh Triveni (accompanied by Surya Ragunaathan and Veera Fauzia Saxena) to lead the vocals for the absolute screwball track that is, ‘Life Mein Fair Chance’. Triveni is a complete riot, channelling the yesteryear Hindi playback style of S P Balasubramanyam to perfection — complete with those little conversational touches added from time to time. Kulkarni’s arrangement is a groovy fusion of rock and roll and South Indian folk percussion, a combination that’s reminiscent of Sagar Desai’s work inQuick Gun Murugun.‘Rappan Rappi Rap’ is practically the musical version of a listicle titled “xx things only 90s kids would remember” — Garima Obrah’s lyrics are teeming with 80s/90s pop culture references, fromStar WarstoHe-Manto Nirma to Pac Man toKaran Arjunto Devang Patel! Not to be outdone is Kulkarni’s incredibly addictive retro funk arrangement for the piece, I particularly loved the bass line by the composer. The choice of Benny Dayal as singer works like a charm, as he’s clearly having a ball with the number.It also helps that Dayal has been experimenting with funk in recent times. If you haven’t already, check out Dayal’s band Funktuation — they came out with a wonderful album calledFunk Kutcherilate last year, a song from which featured in our Annual Roundup for 2018. The ‘Ude Ude Chale Chale’ hook from the song gets adapted into an engaging electronic rap track written and rendered by Kulkarni, replete with martial arts references in keeping with the song, ‘Shaolin Sky’s’ situational nature (it is a training song, I am told). Kulkarni draws from the standard Bollywood Punjabi dance template to create ‘Kitthon Da Tu Superstar’, though the occasional experimental aspects do show up here too, like the Arabic percussion (darbuka?) and that throwaway trumpet-led reference to ‘Rappan Rappi Rap’. An exuberant Sanj V is the lead singer on this one as well as the Shooter Version of the song where the instrumental passages get longer and the vocal bits are minimal — Dipanjan Guha handles the arrangement for this one.Kulkarni makes his composing debut forMKDNHin resounding style, with a delightfully quirky cocktail of genres."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"France's ""yellow vests"" are expected to stage further anti-government protests Saturday despite the authorities vowing a ""zero tolerance"" approach after major riots in Paris last week.Also ReadUnited colours of the ‘yellow vests’Paris police have banned the protesters from a large area in the west of the city, including the famed Champs-Elysees avenue, scene of last week's rampage by hundreds of anarchists, as well as the presidential palace and National Assembly.Similar bans have been announced in the centres of Toulouse, Bordeaux, Dijon, Rennes and the southern city of Nice where Chinese President Xi Jinping is to meet his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron this weekend.Also ReadThe Hindu explains: Why are riots happening in France?Mr. Macron is under pressure to avoid a repeat of last week's sacking of the Champs-Elysees, where over 100 shops were damaged, looted or set alight during seven hours of rioting by mainly masked, black-clad protesters.The government has announced plans to redeploy soldiers from its Sentinelle anti-terror force Saturday to guard public buildings to free up the police to tackle the radicals.The announcement has drawn howls of protest from the opposition who have accused the government of playing with fire.On social media, ""yellow vest"" leaders, who have been accused of whipping up the violence with incendiary rhetoric, urged caution Saturday.In a YouTube post, truck driver Eric Drouet called on protesters not to try to return to the Champs-Elysees.""It's a very very bad idea. You know what image they're trying to create of us,"" he said, predicting a ""quiet Saturday"".Macron's government drew fierce criticism over its handling of last week's protests.The police appeared to hang back in the face of sustained attacks, after being accused of using excessive force during several previous such protests.The Paris police chief was fired over the violence.'Beaten psychologically' -On Friday, clean-up operations continued on the Champs-Elysees.Shattered panes were being removed from a Swarovski crystal store, which was ransacked after neglecting to board up its windows.Work was also being carried out on six news kiosks that were torched, leaving several newspaper vendors out of work.Sylvain, the leader of a team of repair workers, who did not wish to give his full name, backed the use of the army to help restore order.""Either they do that, or Macron resigns.""""He needs to show the world that the government has a handle on the country and on the capital,"" he said.The protests began in rural France on November 17 over fuel tax increases and quickly ballooned into a full-scale anti-government rebellion that two months of public policy debates have failed to defuse.In recent weeks, the protesters' numbers have dwindled, falling from 282,000 nationwide on the first Saturday to just 32,000 last week, according to official estimates.Those still on the streets appear more determined than ever to make their presence felt, however.In a Facebook video this week, Maxime Nicolle, explained the periodic rioting in Paris and other cities as the result of ""40 years of being beaten psychologically and financially"" by successive governments.""It's a bit as if a battered woman beats up her boyfriend and you say she's the violent one,"" he argued.The violence has cost the protesters, who want higher taxes on the rich and a greater say for ordinary people in the running of the country, public support, according to a poll published Wednesday.Some 53 percent of respondents said they either supported or felt a degree of sympathy towards the movement, down eight points in a week."

The politics of Tibetan representation,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-politics-of-tibetan-representation/article26616500.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A young woman in the distinctive red-and-yellow habit of a Tibetan nun strikes a pose of grit and resilience in a widely shared publicity still from Abhishek Majumdar’s new playPah-La, soon to premiere at London’s Royal Court Theatre. With her hands resolutely on her hips, she stands in for the play’s protagonist, Deshar, a young Tibetan runaway who becomes a Buddhist nun. In the play, a new struggle for freedom is sparked off by Deshar’s singular ‘act of defiance’, an attempt at self-immolation that takes place long before the first recorded real-life case in 2009. Powerful and historic in its scope,Pah-Lais based on true accounts from the insurrection in Lhasa in 2008. Although the uprising was violent and bloody, Majumdar weaves it into a narrative that is a meditation on the non-violent means that purportedly characterised past struggles in the region.Mired in controversyAlthough the girl in the photograph is not part ofPah-La’s cast, she is one of many multicultural ‘people of character’ who represent the Royal Court’s impressively inclusive spring season in promotional material. The diverse offerings include a verbatim piece on the illegal detention of young Russian antifascists; a documentary retracing of a transatlantic slave crossing by cargo ship; and a play on the furore ignited by a racially-charged skin cream advert in Singapore.Pah-Laalmost did not make the cut. Originally slated to open at the venue’s studio space, Jerwood Theatre Upstairs, in October 2017, the initial fixture was cancelled ostensibly due to ‘financial reasons’, However, Majumdar went public with credible allegations that the play’s shelving was on account of pressure from the British Council’s cultural wing in China. A public apology later, the play was reinstated in the venue’s arts calendar, albeit for this year.The primary characters in Majumdar’s play are ethnic Tibetan, except for a Chinese police officer, Commander Deng, and his family. It’s a mixed-gender ensemble of eight actors, playing 17 characters ranging in age from ten to the mid-fifties. Earlier this month, the cast for the Royal Court production directed by Debbie Hannan was unveiled. Conspicuous in a line-up of mainly East Asian actors was the complete absence of Tibetan talent. The announcement swiftly prompted the hashtag #SeeTibetans on Twitter, and strong murmurings of dissent on what is being perceived as an egregiously tone-deaf oversight. The venue immediately released details of its casting process — a public open audition call in December had not led to anyone of Tibetan heritage being shortlisted. The release stated that the venue did always “interrogate the politics of the casting, and take very seriously our responsibilities” towards the international plays they produced.Inclusion and exclusionActor and activist Kunsang Kelden wrote, “Leaving Tibetans out of stories about Tibetans damages our visibility and our impact to exist. It relegates us to a disappeared nation, not the modern people that we are.” She and other actors claim to have been stonewalled during the audition process. She called out the Royal Court for using Chinese political rhetoric to characterise the Lhasa uprising as a ‘riot’ in their promotional material, and the misleading image of ‘a Tibetan girl in a nun costume’ to sell tickets. She also called into question Majumdar’s own outreach efforts with the Tibetan community based in London. It is important to note that this is not a case of white-washing, such as the controversial casting of Tilda Swinton as an ancient Tibetan monk inDoctor Strange. The actors inPah-Laall come from minority backgrounds not adequately represented on the British stage.As someone who has developed a strong affiliation with the Tibetan cause, Majumdar wrote a lengthy open letter on Facebook. While he was not involved in casting in this case, he asserted that his own production ofPah-La(in Tibetan) to be staged in Dharamsala had already secured an all-Tibetan cast. His painstaking research and work on the play has spanned five years, and he assured his Tibetan friends that there was no intention on anyone’s part to exclude Tibetans.A meeting between the venue and those who have stated their misgivings publicly finally went ahead, with Tibetan filmmaker Sonam Anjatsang later tweeting, “(The Royal Court) were open, transparent and apologetic. They are committed to #SeeTibetans in theatre, we look forward to continuing the conversation!” This was an important dialogue on the politics of Tibetan representation on one hand and cultural visibility on the other, whoever the agents might be. It would certainly have been a pity if Tibetan audiences in London were alienated from watching a rare and significant play about themselves."
Tension grips Kottappady after standoff between Church factions,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tension-grips-kottappady-after-standoff-between-church-factions/article26595742.ece,"
Orthodox priest stopped from taking charge of the church
",,"Tension prevailed for hours in front of St. George Hebron Jacobite Syrian Church at Naganchery in Kottappady following a standoff between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara Church on Wednesday morning.The drama started when the Orthodox faction, led by Fr. Kuriakose Mathew, who was to assume charge as priest of the church, armed with a High Court order stating that the Naganchery church was to be governed as per the 1934 constitution of the Malankara Church, arrived at the church gate around 9.45 a.m.By then a large number of Jacobite faction members, nearly 1,000 according to the police, had locked up the gate of the church and blocked their entry by resorting to a prayer protest.Stopped‘‘I was stopped from assuming charge as priest of the church by the Jacobite faction. This amounted to violation of the court order and we will file a contempt of court petition,’’ said Fr. Kuriakose.The standoff lasted for two hours before the Orthodox faction members returned. A huge posse of police personnel was deployed in the area.The police registered a case against the Jacobite faction invoking Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place), 506 (1) (criminal intimidation), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code."

Yogi Adityanath built himself the image of a firebrand Hindutva leader long before he became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. In this interview, conducted in Hindi, Mr. Adityanath talks about how ‘development for all’ is a corollary of his religious inspiration, and the many controversies of his tenure. ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The police respond with force if criminals attack them or innocent people, but no encounter in Uttar Pradesh on his watch was staged, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said.“The police open fire where they are fired at.…It is the rule of law,” he said in an exclusive interviewThe Hindu.Around 80 people have been killed in police encounters since he took over two years ago on March 19.The Chief Minister said he considered all people equal and his vision for governance was inspired by his faith. He reiterated the point when asked if he was trying to effect an image makeover — from being an exclusive Hindu leader to a champion of development. “A Hindu is interested in the welfare of all, not merely humans, but all living beings,” he said.Excerpts from the intervew:You have completed two years as Chief Minister. What is your scorecard?The last two years have seen transformation and the well-being of the people of U.P. In the previous 15-20 years, U.P. became associated with certain traits that ruined the reputation of the State. We have changed that bad reputation. The State has made great strides in development and governance, in gaining trust and honour, in the last two years. We have been able to do this thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modiji’s guidance and the hard work of our officials.You say you are for ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. In your earlier campaigns, your image was of a Hindu leader. As Chief Minister, are you the leader of only Hindus or the leader of all people?I am a Hindu, and I have pride in that. A Hindu is interested in the welfare of all, not merely humans but all living beings.Sarve bhavantu sukhina, sarve santu niramaya. Sanatan Hindu dharma has given this message to the world. The well-being of everyone... that is Hindu philosophy. Everyone must follow this philosophy. As Chief Minister, I am happy that every class, caste, religion and citizen is benefiting from our programmes. We have implemented ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ with full commitment in U.P.What is your biggest achievement?U.P.’s law and order has become a model for the country. This used to be a State where every second day you had a riot, the mafia raj was widespread, gangs were being sheltered by the administration. We have been successful in changing that perception. Because of that change in perception, besides implementing Modiji’s flagship schemes in various sectors, U.P. is doing much more. The U.P. Investors Summit was a great success. We hosted the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, and the Kumbh in Prayagraj for 25 crore people. It was the most successful ever, and with a message of cleanliness and security.So, are you transforming yourself from aHindu hriday samrat(emperor of Hindu hearts) to avikas purush(man of development)?Listen, this is no transformation. The real Hindu vision is that nobody will be discriminated against or favoured. Everyone is equal. Development is for all. We are implementing that vision in U.P. We are today the first in the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. We are number one in the Swachh Bharat Mission, in tourism. India is the best destination for FDI, and U.P. is the best in India. Our procurement policy is farmer friendly. We ensure that the minimum support price is given to farmers, and the money reaches their bank accounts in 48 hours. No middlemen. We have added more land to the irrigation network in the last two years than in the 20 years prior to that.So, the biggest change is in law and order. There has been a dramatic rise in the number of encounters by the police ever since you became Chief Minister. About 80 people have been killed by the police. Is this the only way to enforce law and order?See, not a single one of the encounters was fake. If the criminal opens fire, the police will not keep their hands tied. Earlier, the police used to run and criminals used to chase them. Because criminals were being shielded by the administration, the Bahujan Samaj Party’s or the Samajwadi Party’s. Today, that is not the case. Today, there is the rule of law in U.P. Those who break the law will be confronted by the law. If someone fires at the police, or at innocent people, it is only natural they will be responded to in a language that they understand, by the police. Our officers have been killed, injured badly in the process, but the security of 23 crore people is my responsibility. It is also my responsibility to provide security to all those who visit U.P.How are you so sure that no encounter was fake?The Supreme Court and the Human Rights Commission have laid down norms to be followed, and those have been adhered to in each case.But the application of law appears selective in U.P. For instance, in the use of the National Security Act (NSA). The police charged Dalit leader Chandrashekhar Azad under the NSA, but did not use it in Bulandshahr (when a Hindutva mob protesting against suspected cow slaughter killed a police officer).No, that is not the case, we have applied the NSA in many cases. In Saharanpur, whether it was Chandrashekhar or the other side. Three from one side and three from the other were charged under the NSA, and the law was not specific to any group. Wherever we have used the NSA, it has been used in a non-discriminatory manner. In Bulandshahr also, strict action has been taken against the culprits. We have sent a strong message. There have been no riots in the State in the last two years. Look at the peaceful and calm manner in which the Kumbh was completed. I am pleased that we could do it.Cow protection has been a big priority for you. How do you analyse the impact of your measures, given that farmers, many of whom are your supporters, are now complaining that stray cattle are ruining their farms?See, what you are describing was the situation two months earlier. Things have significantly improved since then. This has been a legacy issue. Yes, we have shut down all the illegal slaughter houses. The National Green Tribunal and court orders on this predate our government. When illegal slaughter houses were closed, a large number of cattle were let loose. We have to protect them, and we also have to protect the farms. Originally our plan was to encourage the community to take care of these cattle. My idea was that cow protection will be done by the community, and we would support their efforts. But it did not succeed in many places. Low milk-yielding breeds are not viable for farmers. We are working on that. Secondly, we wanted to spread sex selection methods to have more female progeny — bulls are needed less as farming gets mechanised. Thirdly, we wanted to develop technology that could refill cooking gas cylinders with gas from dung so that cattle remain productive. But the farmers began saying we should take care of these stray cattle first. As of now, we have four lakh cattle being taken care of in shelters. We needed money for this. We used the MGNREGA for construction in some places. We introduced a cess on foreign liquor in some places. We also generated some money from mandis — this is related to the welfare of farmers, after all. Our measures for cow protection will continue.You have been renaming places. What is the thought behind this?If Bombay can become Mumbai, Bangalore can become Bengaluru, Madras can become Chennai, and Calcutta can become Kolkota, there is no reason why Allahabad should not become Prayagraj and Faizabad should not become Ayodhya. To re-establish our original identity, we have renamed these places. I am happy that people have welcomed this.But there are no religious undertones in the case of the other cities you mentioned.That is not the case. Mumbai is from Mumba Devi Mandir. You are from Kerala. How did Trivandrum become Thiruvananthapuram? It is after Bhagwan Vishnu. We are only restoring our heritage.But aren’t Mughals also part of our heritage?No. Foreign aggressors cannot be part of our heritage. Those who are our citizens today are our citizens. Their security and welfare are our responsibility. But if someone says that foreign aggressors are part of our inheritance, I will say that is slave mentality.What are you going to fight this Lok Sabha election on?Development, good governance and nationalism. In the last five years under Modiji, the BJP-led alliance has, through numerous welfare schemes, touched the lives of all people without any discrimination. There has been unprecedented progress in infrastructure, and external and internal security. All this is being achieved through nationalism. When Modiji came to power, dozens of districts were affected by Naxalism. Today, it is confined to five-six districts. The Northeast had several separatist incidents — all the extremists were neutralised through one surgical strike. Kashmir used to witness massive incidents of stone pelting. Today, it is under control. The surgical strike broke the backbone of terrorism and the recent air strikes in Pakistan-controlled territories... All this is unprecedented. People want India to be prosperous and resolute. Modiji is able to do all this because this is a stable government. He is a strong leader. The Opposition has no leader, and it does not have the right intentions.You mentioned security. On this question, several BJP leaders, including Mr. Modi, have spoken about threats coming from those who ‘live in India but who speak the language of Pakistan’. What does this mean?Direct or indirect support to terrorism, or to show softness towards terrorists, is unfortunate. For the Congress to promise that it will dilute sedition laws is an act of encouraging anti-national forces. To use ‘ji’ while referring to terrorists... I am surprised by the level of [Congress President] Rahul Gandhi’s understanding. He uses foul language for Modiji. Our Defence Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, is being attacked in vicious language.Unlike last time, your key opponents, the SP and the BSP, are now together. They won all three byelections after they came together.Those were byelections. That won’t have any impact now. The BJP will win 74-plus seats in U.P. That is more than the 2014 tally.And when will you become Prime Minister?I am not in that race. I am happy in the service of U.P.Are you planning to campaign outside U.P. too?U.P. will be my focus, but I will campaign wherever the party asks me to.You have apparently postponed the plan for the temple in Ayodhya. Meanwhile, you have announced a Ram statue in Ayodhya.We are making progress. We won’t backtrack. Whatever we have announced, we shall do.The temple or the statue?Everything will be completed during our tenure."

The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister on encounter killings, cow protection, renaming places, and the Lok Sabha polls
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Yogi Adityanath built himself the image of a firebrand Hindutva leader long before he became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. In this interview, conducted in Hindi, Mr. Adityanath talks about how ‘development for all’ is a corollary of his religious inspiration, and the many controversies of his tenure. Excerpts:You have completed two years as Chief Minister. What is your scorecard?The last two years have seen transformation and the well-being of the people of U.P. In the previous 15-20 years, U.P. became associated with certain traits that ruined the reputation of the State. We have changed that bad reputation. The State has made great strides in development and governance, in gaining trust and honour, in the last two years. We have been able to do this thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modiji’s guidance and the hard work of our officials.You say you are for ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. In your earlier campaigns, your image was of a Hindu leader. As Chief Minister, are you the leader of only Hindus or the leader of all people?I am a Hindu, and I have pride in that. A Hindu is interested in the welfare of all, not merely humans but all living beings.Sarve bhavantu sukhina, sarve santu niramaya. Sanatan Hindu dharma has given this message to the world. The well-being of everyone... that is Hindu philosophy. Everyone must follow this philosophy. As Chief Minister, I am happy that every class, caste, religion and citizen is benefiting from our programmes. We have implemented ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ with full commitment in U.P.What is your biggest achievement?U.P.’s law and order has become a model for the country. This used to be a State where every second day you had a riot, the mafia raj was widespread, gangs were being sheltered by the administration. We have been successful in changing that perception. Because of that change in perception, besides implementing Modiji’s flagship schemes in various sectors, U.P. is doing much more. The U.P. Investors Summit was a great success. We hosted the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, and the Kumbh in Prayagraj for 25 crore people. It was the most successful ever, and with a message of cleanliness and security.So, are you transforming yourself from aHindu hriday samrat(emperor of Hindu hearts) to avikas purush(man of development)?Listen, this is no transformation. The real Hindu vision is that nobody will be discriminated against or favoured. Everyone is equal. Development is for all. We are implementing that vision in U.P. We are today the first in the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. We are number one in the Swachh Bharat Mission, in tourism. India is the best destination for FDI, and U.P. is the best in India. Our procurement policy is farmer friendly. We ensure that the minimum support price is given to farmers, and the money reaches their bank accounts in 48 hours. No middlemen. We have added more land to the irrigation network in the last two years than in the 20 years prior to that.So, the biggest change is in law and order. There has been a dramatic rise in the number of encounters by the police ever since you became Chief Minister. About 80 people have been killed by the police. Is this the only way to enforce law and order?See, not a single one of the encounters was fake. If the criminal opens fire, the police will not keep their hands tied. Earlier, the police used to run and criminals used to chase them. Because criminals were being shielded by the administration, the Bahujan Samaj Party’s or the Samajwadi Party’s. Today, that is not the case. Today, there is the rule of law in U.P. Those who break the law will be confronted by the law. If someone fires at the police, or at innocent people, it is only natural they will be responded to in a language that they understand, by the police. Our officers have been killed, injured badly in the process, but the security of 23 crore people is my responsibility. It is also my responsibility to provide security to all those who visit U.P.How are you so sure that no encounter was fake?The Supreme Court and the Human Rights Commission have laid down norms to be followed, and those have been adhered to in each case.But the application of law appears selective in U.P. For instance, in the use of the National Security Act (NSA). The police charged Dalit leader Chandrashekhar Azad under the NSA, but did not use it in Bulandshahr (when a Hindutva mob protesting against suspected cow slaughter killed a police officer).No, that is not the case, we have applied the NSA in many cases. In Saharanpur, whether it was Chandrashekhar or the other side. Three from one side and three from the other were charged under the NSA, and the law was not specific to any group. Wherever we have used the NSA, it has been used in a non-discriminatory manner. In Bulandshahr also, strict action has been taken against the culprits. We have sent a strong message. There have been no riots in the State in the last two years. Look at the peaceful and calm manner in which the Kumbh was completed. I am pleased that we could do it.Cow protection has been a big priority for you. How do you analyse the impact of your measures, given that farmers, many of whom are your supporters, are now complaining that stray cattle are ruining their farms?See, what you are describing was the situation two months earlier. Things have significantly improved since then. This has been a legacy issue. Yes, we have shut down all the illegal slaughter houses. The National Green Tribunal and court orders on this predate our government. When illegal slaughter houses were closed, a large number of cattle were let loose. We have to protect them, and we also have to protect the farms. Originally our plan was to encourage the community to take care of these cattle. My idea was that cow protection will be done by the community, and we would support their efforts. But it did not succeed in many places. Low milk-yielding breeds are not viable for farmers. We are working on that. Secondly, we wanted to spread sex selection methods to have more female progeny — bulls are needed less as farming gets mechanised. Thirdly, we wanted to develop technology that could refill cooking gas cylinders with gas from dung so that cattle remain productive. But the farmers began saying we should take care of these stray cattle first. As of now, we have four lakh cattle being taken care of in shelters. We needed money for this. We used the MGNREGA for construction in some places. We introduced a cess on foreign liquor in some places. We also generated some money from mandis — this is related to the welfare of farmers, after all. Our measures for cow protection will continue.You have been renaming places. What is the thought behind this?If Bombay can become Mumbai, Bangalore can become Bengaluru, Madras can become Chennai, and Calcutta can become Kolkota, there is no reason why Allahabad should not become Prayagraj and Faizabad should not become Ayodhya. To re-establish our original identity, we have renamed these places.

'Yellow Vest' protesters loot Paris stores,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yellow-vest-ultimatum-rally-turns-violent-in-paris/article26554850.ece,"
A large crowd gathered on the Champs-Elysees avenue for the 18th straight week of anti-government protests.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Demonstrators looted stores on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris on Saturday, on the 18th week of ""Yellow Vest"" protests, characterised by an uptick in violence after dwindling participation in recent weeks.A Boss menswear store and the high-end Fouquet's restaurant were among the premises targeted as groups of masked protesters lobbed stones at police defending the Arc de Triomphe war memorial. The police responded with teargas and water cannon.After weeks of declining participation, France's ""yellow vest"" protest movement attempted to rebound with a major rally in Paris which quickly turned violent.A large crowd gathered on the Champs-Elysees avenue for the 18th straight week of anti-government protests which initially rocked President Emmanuel Macron's administration, forcing him to adopt more anti-poverty measures, but had appeared to fizzle in recent weeks.Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who erected barricades near the Champs-Elysees in scenes reminiscent of some of the most tense “yellow vest” rallies.Saturday's attempted reboot coincides with the end of two months of public debates called by Mr. Macron to take the heat out of the protests, which repeatedly ended in rioting in December and January.The level of participation will be seen as a bellwether of support for the movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes but quickly ballooned into an anti-Macron revolt.Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17.The organisers of Saturday's protest presented it as an “ultimatum” to Mr. Macron, prompting fears of a return to the violence that characterised earlier rallies.Over 5,000 police were deployed.A large security cordon had been thrown up around the Champs-Elysees, where the Arc de Triomphe war memorial was sacked and stores looted and vandalised by protesters on December 1 in images that caused shock worldwide.In December, Mr. Macron attempted to stopper the movement by pledging €10 billion ($11.2 billion) in tax cuts and benefits for the low paid and pensioners.He also launched a “grand national debate” on the internet and town hall meetings to gather opinions on how the country could be reformed.Laurent Casanova, an engineer who was among the protesters, toldAFPhe had come to mark the end of the consultations.“We have been patient but now we want results,” he said.The protest is one of several planned in Paris on Saturday, where French climate campaigners are also planning a “March of The Century”."
The Nawabs played Holi,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-nawabs-played-holi/article26564375.ece,"
Ahead of the festival of colours, let’s recall how the Walled City celebrated the festival
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Nawabs and nawabzadas playing Holi despite Islamic taboo may sound far-fetched, but is not untrue. Delhi’s Nawab Buddhan of Suiwalan, Nawab Dojana of Matia Mahal, the Nawab of Basai Darapur and Nawab F. Z. Khan of Agra, did not mind a bit of colour revelry in post-1857 days. Their families enjoyed it too. For the women, it meant catching relatives and friends unawares early in the morning, splashing them with cold water and colouring their faces with red and black powder. “Tu bilkul churail lag rahi hai Bhabhi” (sister-in-law you are really looking like a she-ghost) was one of the epithets hurled during the sudden tamasha. Fun over, it was time to clean up the mess and change soiled clothes for visits by sethanis (wives of the city seths) who brought sweets and other savouries in abundance. This is what Mohd Mian Akbar, a Ballimaran shoe merchant, used to say up to his death in the 1980s. However, to counter his view (despite repetition) here is what an Englishman had to say a 100 years earlier:“Holi” is celebrated by Hindus but not by Muslims, who resent colour being thrown on them. The festival falls in March which corresponds to the Indian month of Phagun, when the colours of spring transform the landscape as if by the magic brush of a painter who, with deft strokes changes the bleak scenario of winter to the yellow, pink and golden hues of “Basant”, said Capt Ridgeway in his diary before the outbreak of the first war of independence, in Delhi. By that time the heat of summer was to bring about a drastic change in the natural surroundings, with tree leaves drooping under the impact of the blazing sun. The only redeeming feature, Ridgeway noted, was the pleasantness of the early mornings and late evenings, “when the heat subsided and one went to the gardens for fresh air and figs sold in leaf-cups the size of dessert quarter-plates”.Tense timesPeople did celebrate Holi in 1857 but it was much subdued the next year, when the British had regained full control of the Capital and the surrounding areas. The same thing happened 90 years later in 1947 when Partition was yet to be effected. Contrary to popular perception, some leading Muslims, among whom were nawabs, did celebrate the festival of colours with great enthusiasm that year too as their ancestors had been courtiers at the durbar of Mohammad Shah Rangila and later Shah Alam, Akbar Shah Sani and Bahadur Shah Zafar.Among them, Mohammad Shah and Zafar celebrated Holi with great gusto, though Shah Alam did not mind dabbling in colours with Maratha chieftains, whose leader, Mahadji Scindia, was the most powerful military leader in North India with the emperor under his thumb. Akbar Shah did not mind his financiers, the bullion merchants of Chandni Chowk led by Seth Sidhu Mal, putting gulal on his forehead and sprinkling rosewater on his royal clothes, which dried up very fast, leaving behind a faint perfume. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the least orthodox of them, liked the Holi revelry of his subjects and also participated in it, but with regard to his status as the inheritor of Mughal dignity. The orthodox nobles of his court however preferred to stay indoors during the time the colour-throwing was at its peak.In 1948, post-Partition, Holi was celebrated on a subdued note in Delhi, Agra and other prominent cities. There were warnings from the police that colour was not to be thrown on unwilling people, yet there was perceptible tension in Chandni Chowk, Daryaganj, Paharganj and Dev Nagar. Fearing a riot, a strong police force was made to patrol the thoroughfares, along with the armed constabulary on the orders of Mr Beadon. Though there was no rioting, sporadic clashes were reported from some areas, where a sort of curfew-like situation prevailed later.Change of colourHowever, by 1949, conditions became stable and Holi was celebrated without major incidents. In the mid-1950s the nawabzadas of Aligarh and Agra, along with some kunwars of Wazirpura and Dhirpura celebrated Holi in style in Chandni Chowk. They went about in an old weapon-carrier spraying colour on all and sundry with rubber tubes immersed in big drums filled with coloured water.That year, like other years, also saw grand celebrations outside Lala Chunna Mal’s haveli. In the Jama Masjid area, a much-married Urdu poet, one of whose compositions is echoed in the film song, “Gal Gulabi, chaal sharabi/Aap se accha kohi nahin hai”, went about greeting his men and women friends in the Walled City and presenting them his romantic verses sprinkled with wet gulal.A practice in those days for Hindi newspapers was to award “Holi degrees” to friends, colleagues, acquaintances and also political leaders. These were in the form of one-line sentences which were both ribald and hilarious. About that time one old tradition that has ended was the Christian Holi, celebrated on Shrove Tuesday, a day before Ash Wednesday, and the beginning of the fasting season of Lent. Now Holi has lost much of its colourful past and even the colours are scarce as black and silver paint and infection-causing dirty water is generally used.No fears of infection were aroused when the Nawab of Loharu played Holi in unpolluted times with the Nawab of Tonk and his own brother-in-law Mirza Ghalib. The poet, however, missed the revelry of Braj Holi in his native Agra and the titillating colour-soaked verses of Mian Nazir Akbarabadi on the much-maligned ""Holi-ka-Bhudua-Diwali-ka-chor"", the fictitious buffoons made the butt of irksome jokes during the two change of season festivals."

Technologies have become powerful so much that they are beyond scrutiny,” he said.He also criticised the reluctance shown by global leaders including United States President Donald Trump in demanding harsher gun control laws. “Mr. Trump has evaded from making a statement against the arms lobby. The proliferation of arms and ammunition has led to the emergence of militant powers who possessed the technology to wage wars,” Mr. Shahani said.He also drew parallels of the live streaming of the massacre in New Zealand with incidents that have occurred in India. “The mass rapes, which were filmed during the Surat riots in 1992, showed how imaging could be used for evil purposes. Such actions were fundamentally against human values,” he said.Noted poet Prabha Varma, academicians Meena T. Pillai, C. Padmanabhan and A. Pasalathil also participated in the session."

As suspense continues on her plan to rejoin Cong., AAP dares her to quit MLA seat
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Having said this week that she was ready to rejoin the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Chandni Chowk Alka Lamba on Saturday said she would “work to defeat the BJP” when asked whether she would quit AAP.Alleging “lack of democracy” within AAP and “disrespect” towards MLAs by party convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Ms. Lamba said she would work against what the BJP stands for. After having been associated with the Congress for 20 years and being the National Students’ Union of India president, she had joined AAP in 2014 and was elected as an AAP MLA in 2015.With Ms. Lamba publicly talking about her disagreements with AAP, Congress general secretary in-charge of Delhi P.C. Chacko had on Friday said the party would “welcome” her back as she had been a “member of the family”.Chacko’s statementSpeaking toThe Hinduon Saturday, Ms. Lamba said she was thankful for Mr. Chacko’s statement, but no one from the Congress had approached her so far.Meanwhile, AAP spokesperson and Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj took to Twitter to take a jibe at Ms. Lamba.“To join the Congress, Alka Lamba would need to resign from AAP. That would mean losing her MLA seat — the MLA seat which lured some to AAP, the MLA seat which many could not get even after serving Congress for 20+ years. It requires courage to leave that MLA seat,” Mr. Bharadwaj said.When asked to respond to Mr. Bharadwaj’s statement, Ms. Lamba said, “I take it as the official statement of the party since he is the spokesperson. I would like to ask the party about what has been done with me since December 21...What about the 15-20 MLAs who were disrespected by Mr. Kejriwal in a meeting with workers?”.She added that she had decided to “work to defeat the BJP” and would “work for the victory of thegathbandhancandidate from Chandni Chowk”, in case an AAP-Congress alliance for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections materialises.On December 21, 2018, AAP MLAs had moved a resolution seeking justice for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots’ victims.While reading the resolution, AAP MLA Jarnail Singh asked for the Bharat Ratna awarded to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to be withdrawn in context of some statements he made in the wake of his mother, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination.Ms. Lamba had objected to the inclusion of this demand, and had offered to resign. Though the resolution was passed, senior AAP leaders had denied that the demand was included in the resolution and when the bulletin of the Assembly proceedings was published the next week, there was no mention of Rajiv Gandhi."

Everybody is angry with the government: Ajit Singh,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/modi-has-no-concern-for-the-poor-oppressed-farmers-ajit-singh/article26561218.ece,"
In a democracy, we need a PM who listens to everybody, consults everyone, then takes a decision, the RLD chief says.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Moving away from his traditional seat of Bhagpat where he was trounced in 2014, veteran Jat leader and Rashtriya Lok Dal president Ajit Singh (80) says he is contesting from Muzaffarnagar to heal the violent communal divide.How important is this election for you, especially after a string of defeats?How important this election is for me, that’s not the question. [The question is] how important it is for the country, for democracy, for keeping our Constitution and saving all our constitutional bodies. If people lose faith in constitutional bodies, there is no democracy. Therefore, this is a very important election. And like Mr. [Amit] Shah said, if Modi wins this time he will be Prime Minister for 50 years. That means there will be no democracy.You think it’s a greater challenge than RLD, SP or BSP...Than me or who is winning... And one thing is very clear as far as U.P. is concerned, this combination, nobody can beat.Why do you think so?Look at the arithmetic.Just arithmetic or is there anything else to the alliance?Every part of society, be it farmers, youth, minority or Dalits — everybody is angry with the government. See, election in a democracy is all about what they have done in the five years; whether to give them another chance . If you look at it, they have not done anything, except a lot of promises of which they haven’t kept a single one. To farmers, they said they will give 150 times the cost, not done. For the youth, two crore jobs per year, now they are saying ‘makepakoras’. And clean Ganga... nothing has happened. Made in India, nothing. Smart cities, not there. So what has he done? Those are the questions and as the campaign progresses, all these questions will come up again. See, all the TV and newspapers are now saying that because of what happened [in Balakot]... but these are the issues on which people will decide. As far as that issue [Balakot air strike] is concerned, everybody is with the army.You have contested many times from Baghpat. But in 2014, not only did you lose, you stood a surprise third. So this time...The last election, at least in this part of India, was not normal because of those riots in Muzaffarnagar.Why did you choose to contest from Muzaffarnagar?Because the riot started from here. Muzaffarnagar’s message went to the whole country. And this was the reason why the BJP won.So you want to uproot the BJP from here?Yes.But isn’t this a big risk for you, since Muzaffarnagar was the hotbed of that violence and communal divide?On February 13 last year, I went to Muzaffarnagar. February 12 was my birthday, I completed 79 years. So I said, the 80th year I will spend on getting rid of that communal divide. I called itbhaichara(brotherhood). And for the last one year, I have been to at least 10 districts, two or three times and stayed there overnight, talking to different groups. So that thing is gone now. The communal divide is not there. And the Kairana election cemented the bonding together of vote banks... our votebank.Jats and Muslims are coming together like before?Yes, yes! In Kairana, not only that, our core voter voted, farmers of all castes and religions voted. Another big issue here is the cow. Cows are worshipped and they forever have been. As far as the farmers are concerned their livestock was their ATM; you need money, you go sell some cattle. Now they didn’t get their price for the sugar cane — this area depends on sugar cane for its economic survival — and then these animals are eating up their other crops. So there is a great deal of anger. That’s a very big issue here.Is that going to be a part of your campaign?I watched a lot of social media and YouTube videos in which farmers are saying, ‘Look what Yogi is doing, eating the crops.’ They call them [stray cows] Yogi and Modi.But the BJP is projecting it like they are actually protecting cows from being slaughtered...Everybody can see what the situation is; they are worse off than they were earlier.Apart from sugar cane, cows, and communal divide that you want to heal, anything else that will be an important issue?Unemployment is a very big issue.Notebandidestroyed the informal economy. And then look at GST, look at farmers, first they declare MSP, then they import all the commodities from abroad. Last year, was there a need to import sugar? Three years ago, they imported wheat when there was a bumper crop. Two years ago, they imported lentils when there was an oversupply of it.They declared MSP but depressed the market price. So farmer doesn’t get the MSP. Then the electricity prices have gone up, double. Tractors used to be tax-free but now been declared commercial vehicles and every year they have to pay tax. Now there is GST too if you are buying a tractor or its parts. Now they are saying, every 10 years you have to buy a new tractor. No farmer can afford it. They run them for 40 years. They have no idea of the rural economy. This has not only affected the farmers. That money circulated in the area. I tell these small businessmen and traders, if ₹10,000 crore is given as farmers’ sugar cane dues, in three months this will be all in your pockets. Everybody is affected right now.Have the dues been paid back to the sugar cane farmers?Mr. Modi has been saying that we have done so and we will pay in 14 days and he would not accept whatever the [actual] figures are. But it’s a plain and simple lie.RSS and BJP say other governments were corrupt and they are not...Ask any person in a village or town, ‘Has corruption increased?’ They all stand up and say ‘yes’. Forget everything, we need a PM in a democracy, who listens to everybody, consults everyone and then takes a decision. He [Mr Modi] doesn’t listen to anyone, doesn’t consult anyone or answer any questions or any press conference. We need a PM...chappan inch ki chaati theek hai, lekin dil bada hona chaiye(a 56-inch chest is fine but one must also be big-hearted). But Modi has no concern for the poor, oppressed, farmers and the unemployed.Are you happy with the three seats that have been given to you as part of the alliance (Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Mathura)?In a combination or seat adjustment, no party is ever happy. Therefore, the question is not that. It is larger. There may be all these seat differences, but in U.P., we didn’t take too much time to discuss and bicker about it... because everybody realises that it is not important.You expect that your core voter will stick with you in Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar. But in other seats where the SP and BSP are contesting, will your voters transfer to them?Yes, yes. As I said, I had gone to 10 districts...with those bhaichara meetings, so they understand.So Jats are also angry with the BJP?They are basically farmers and aggressive farmers. The farmer’s situation and the farming community feels they are being left out.On April 7, you, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati will hold a rally in Saharanpur, kicking off your joint campaign. How important is it for U.P. that you three have come together?Let me put it this way, in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana, the combination already existed. Now we have formalised it."

Thousands of people converge on the Champs-Elysees as demonstrations enter 18th week
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Demonstrators looted stores on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris on Saturday, on the 18th week of ‘yellow vest’ protests, characterised by an uptick in violence after dwindling participation in recent weeks. A Boss menswear store and the gourmet Fouquet’s restaurant were among the premises vandalised as groups of masked protesters lobbed stones at police defending the Arc de Triomphe war memorial.The police responded with tear gas and water cannon but failed to disperse the more radical protesters who erected burning barricades in scenes reminiscent of the worst “yellow vest” riots in the capital in December. The rally was called to coincide with the end of two months of public debates called by President Emmanuel Macron to give voters a forum to air their grievances and propose policy changes.The protesters have dismissed the debates as a smoke-screen.Focal pointThousands of people converged on the Champs-Elysees — focal point of the Paris protests over the past four months — for “Act XVIII” of a movement which had appeared to be running out of steam but whose core demands still enjoy broad public support. The Arc de Triomphe, which was sacked by protesters on December 1, was again the focal point of the unrest.Black-clad demonstrators encircled the square surrounding the arch, pelting the police with stones. “Macron, we’re coming to get you at home,” some of the protesters chanted, referring to the presidential palace near the Champs-Elysees. Thirty-one people had been arrested by mid-morning, the police said.Interior Minister Christophe Castaner condemned the violence as the work of “professional trouble-makers” who had “infiltrated” the march and said he had ordered police to “react with the greatest firmness to these unacceptable attacks.”Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17."

Ronaldo’s hat-trick lifts Juventus into Champions League quarter-finals
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored a spectacular hat-trick to fire Juventus into the Champions League quarter-finals with a 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid on Tuesday that saw his side claim a thrilling tie 3-2 on aggregate.The Portuguese superstar scored two headers either side of half-time and a late penalty to clinch a place in Friday's last-eight draw with a dominant display by the Italian champions in Turin.‘This is why Juve brought me’“It was always going to be a special night and it was, not only for the goals, but for the team,” said Ronaldo. “This is the mentality of champions. This is why Juve brought me in, to help on magical nights like this.”Diego Simeone's Atletico were a shadow of the team who had run riot in the first leg in Madrid, and crashed out of the tournament they had been hoping to win in their own Wanda Metropolitano Stadium on June 1.It is the eighth time that Ronaldo has scored a hat-trick in the competition and mirrors his treble which lifted former club Real Madrid past Wolfsburg in April 2016 with the Spaniards 2-0 down after the first leg.Juventus signed 34-year-old Ronaldo last summer from Real Madrid for 100 million euros in order to make the difference on the continent for the Italian champions, who have not won the Champions League since 1996 and have finished runners-up twice in the past four seasons.And five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo pulled out a spectacular performance as he spearheaded the attack along with Federico Bernardeschi and Mario Mandzukic.Dominant JuveAllegri's side came out firing, dominating the first half with nine shots on goal compared to three for the Spaniards.Atletico had an early scare when Juventus skipper Giorgio Chiellini, making his 500th Juve appearance, had the ball in the back of the net after four minutes.But a VAR review confirmed Ronaldo had fouled goalkeeper Jan Oblak in a scramble in front of goal before defender Chiellini had finished off.Defensive specialists Atletico held off the Juventus pressure until the 27th minute, when Ronaldo met a pin-point Bernardeschi cross to head home the opener.A Chiellini header from a Miralem Pjanic corner was cleared by Oblak, before Alvaro Morata missed a chance for an away goal before the break when he shook off Leonardo Bonucci only to head over.But back after the break Ronaldo levelled the tie with his second goal with a move he began from his own half with a pass to Leonardo Spinazzola down the left.The ball was worked to Joao Cancelo, who crossed into the penalty area for Ronaldo, whose powerful header was pushed out by Oblak but not before it had crossed over the line.Teenager Moise Kean then missed a chance to put Juve ahead just after coming off the bench.But the decisive goal came with four minutes left when Bernardeschi burst into the penalty area from the left and was brought down by Angel Correa.Ronaldo made no mistake from the spot to score his 25th goal against Atletico, and fourth hat-trick, to spark pandemonium among the home crowd.

The Dosmoche festival is celebrated to purify the town by burning down evil spirits
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The dreary, cold winter morning in Leh comes alive with a riot of colours and the pleasant sound of sacred chants. The ringing of bells signals ceremony and the drum announces the imminent ritual, the gongs proclaim the forthcoming festival and the ‘wooden fish’ (wooden percussion instrument) keeps rhythm with the guttural chants of the Buddhist monks that resonate from the Leh Palace. It is a time to purge and purify the town, a time to lure all the evil spirits and burn them down.The Buddhist festAttired in their best Ladakhi traditional costume, thousands of people from the nearby valleys of Leh gather to celebrate the Dosmoche, the Buddhist festival of the 'scapegoat' that falls in the second half of February. It is a unique annual celebration by the Buddhists of the Vajrayana School.Comfortably perching on the rocks and boulders around the courtyard of the Leh Palace, people gather to witness the monks in vibrant coloured clothes, wearing formidable masks made of wood and mud to perform the sacred mask dance known as the Chams, depicting stories from the Buddhist Scriptures.The monks, on the first day fashion a hideous human effigy, a ‘sthorma’ (the scapegoat) out of dough and simultaneously create ‘Tomas’ sculptures made from barley and butter. A wooden mast made from colourful threads, decorated with paper streamers and religious symbols, designed by the monks of the Thakthok Monastery is erected in the centre of the crowded town. This is believed to hold the evil in captive.On the second day, after a preliminary offering to the Gods in the Palace Chambers, the monks carry the Sthorma and the Tomas to the centre of the town to be burnt. The procession consists of folk musicians, monks playing their traditional instruments, monastic priests donning masks and other holy gurus chanting prayers to ward off the evil spirits.All the Tomas and the Sthorma are disjointed and thrown into a bonfire. These are the 'scapegoat's that entice the hungry ghosts, symbols of eternal starvation and greed. The demons and devils of the past year follow them and are annihilated in the fire. The wooden mast with threads is ripped apart and thrown into the blaze.Gaudy gambling dens, food counters, roadside traders selling an assortment of wares like clothes, footwear, trinkets and spices in the centre of the town add to the excitement of this festive celebration.Besides Leh, the Dosmoche that is fixed according to the Tibetan Lunar Calendar is celebrated with equal élan in the monasteries of Likir in Lower Ladakh and Deskit in the Nubra Valley.The writers are ace photographers known for their travelogues"

They will gradually disappear when society no longer needs them, says China
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A Chinese official on Tuesday rejected international criticism of internment camps in the restive Xinjiang region, calling them job training centres that will “gradually disappear” if “one day society no longer needs it”.Nearly one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic minorities are being held in detention centres in Xinjiang, according to estimates cited by a UN panel.But Beijing has denied the accusations, saying people are attending “vocational education centres” to rid them of any extremist thoughts in a region that was hit by deadly riots and attacks in recent years.“Our education and training centres have been set up according to our needs. The students that come in to learn, it’s a dynamic number that changes,” Shohrat Zakir, chairman of Xinjiang’s government, told journalists on the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary meeting.“As a whole, the number of people in the education centres should be less and less, and if one day society no longer needs it, these education centres can gradually disappear,” he said, without providing the number of people at the facilities.In an 18-minute-long reply to a journalist’s question, Mr. Zakir defended the centres, saying that they taught Xinjiang residents Chinese, helped them gain awareness of the law, improved vocational skills, and were vital in the region’s fight against extremism. “When (students) are able to distinguish between right and wrong and able to resist the infiltration of extreme thoughts... they have a strong desire to get rid of poverty and get rich, actively pursuing a better life,” he added.Being brainwashedFormer inmates have said they found themselves incarcerated for transgressions such as wearing long beards and face veils or sharing Islamic holiday greetings on social media.Critics allege Uighurs in the camps are being brainwashed in a massive campaign to enforce conformity with Chinese society and the abandonment of Islam.Mr. Zakir also hit out at “certain individuals”, whom he says “sensationalised” the number of people in these centres. “It’s not like that,” he said, calling on reporters to visit Xinjiang.But, journalists are harassed and surveilled by local authorities when reporting in the region. “ I think, a horrific situation there,” U.S. envoy on religious freedom Sam Brownback said."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"FC Goa, playing at full strength as promised by coach Sergio Lobera, qualified for its second final in five seasons of the ISL.Breathing free after the tearaway 5-1 win in the away leg against Mumbai City FC, the hosts went down by a stunning Rafael Bastos goal at home in the Nehru stadium on Tuesday. The fans let out a roar at the final whistle, buoyed by the 5-2 aggregate.Mumbai City changed its approach, executing the tactics designed by coach Jorge Costa. Needing to win by a five-goal margin, the visitors did beat Goa goalkeeper Naveen Kumar once on an exciting night under the lights and exited after playing the right game in the wrong match.Issoko’s assistMumbai City, in blue, silenced a sea of orange in the stands just six minutes into the game. Arnold Issoko, the most dangerous player in the first leg, picked up the ball off a misspass, darted ahead, leaped over a defensive challenge before rolling it along the turf for teammate Bastos to glide in on cue and guide the ball into the net.The Congo playmaker and the Brazilian sniper had teamed up to strike first for the visitors in the Mumbai leg, but this time the script took a different twist in the face of a determined Mumbai City rearguard. The defence played close to deny the eager bunch of Goa ball-players a clear view of the target.The home team, applying pressure around the rival goalmouth, earned two free-kicks within striking distance of goal but Brandon Fernandes could not find his man in the goalmouth.A stream of corner kicks, too, did not yield results. Lobera was forced to take out creative ace Ahmed Jahouh, suffering a hand injury, and introduced Edu Bedia. Mumbai City’s physical play helped the side stay in front till half-time.Subashish Bose was a big name missing in the Mumbai defence, paying the price for a collective below-par show by the backline in the first leg when Goa ran riot. The first half saw frenetic action, and the flow changed after the breather as Lobera’s team slowed down the pace and cashed in on speed with the ball to attack in waves.Skipper Amrinder, in the Mumbai City goal, was taken off and the armband given to Paulo Machado. The latter rescued his team twice as the home team came close to equalising in the second half.The result:FC Goa 0 lost to Mumbai City FC 1 (Bastos 6)."

‘Party is going against Gandhian ideals’
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On the 89th anniversary of the historic Dandi salt march, and on a day when the Congress was holding a meeting of the party’s working committee in Ahmedabad, Prime Minister Narendra Modi penned a blog criticising the current culture in the Congress party as being the “antithesis of Gandhian thought”.The blog, released online via Mr. Modi’s Twitter handle, said that the Congress, in its current form, had become synonymous with corruption. Mahatma Gandhi, the Prime Minister said, had “taught us to think of the plight of the poorest person we have seen and think about how our work impacts that person”.Speaking of his own government’s record, he said, he was “proud to say that in all aspects of our government’s work, the guiding consideration is to see how it will alleviate poverty and bring prosperity. Sadly, the antithesis of Gandhian thought is the Congress culture.”‘Society divided’He added that the Mahatma did not believe in inequality and caste divisions but, “Sadly, the Congress has never hesitated from dividing society. The worst caste riots and anti-Dalit massacres happened under Congress rule.”By going against Gandhi’s teachings that held that detachment and staying away from excess wealth was important, “all that the Congress has done is to fill their own bank accounts and lead luxurious lifestyles at the cost of providing basic necessities to the poor,” Mr. Modi said.“The nation has seen how Congress and corruption have become synonyms. Name the sector and there will be a Congress scam — from defence, telecom, irrigation, sporting events to agriculture, rural development and more,” he said.He also said that while ‘Bapu’ (Mahatma Gandhi) despised dynastic politics, “dynasty first” was the way for the Congress today.Hitting out at the Opposition party on the issue of people’s rights, he said that Gandhi believed that democracy gave the weak the same chance as the strong, but the Congress “gave the nation the Emergency, when our democratic spirit was trampled over.”“Gandhi ji had understood the Congress culture very well, which is why he wanted the Congress disbanded, especially after 1947,” the Prime Minister said, adding “Thankfully, today we have a government at the Centre that is working on Bapu’s path.”Sadly, the antithesis of Gandhian thought is the Congress cultureNarendra ModiPrime Minister"

Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi accused each other of sullying the legacy of the Mahatma and working against his principles.

The day also marked the anniversary of the historic Dandi March, started by Mahatma Gandhi from Sabarmati Ashram on March 12, 1930.Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Modi accused each other of sullying the legacy of the Mahatma and working against his principles. They both claimed to be working for the fulfillment of Mahatma Gandhi’s vision.Mr. Gandhi said in Mr. Modi’s home turf of Gujarat that the Statehas fostered two differing ideas of India— one represented by Gandhi and the other by his assassin, Nathuram Godse. “On one side is hatred, symbolised by Godse; and on the other side is love, symbolised by Mahatma Gandhi and Gujarat’s heritage. And the victory will be of love, Mahatma Gandhi, brotherhood, Gujarat and the Congress party,"" Mr. Gandhi said.While Mr. Gandhi made his political point bypatching his Congress partyon to the vision, Mr. Modi’stake on Gandhi’s messagewas notable by an omission.“Gandhijisaid that he does not believe in inequality and caste divisions. Sadly, the Congress has never hesitated from dividing society. The worst caste riots and anti-Dalit massacres happened under Congress rule,” Mr. Modi said in a blog, that also accused the Congress of being the antithesis of Gandhian thought.Mr. Modi is certainly right that a lot of caste riots and anti-Dalit massacres did take place on the Congress’s watch. What Mr. Modi did not say is that several riots targeting Muslims also took place during Congress rule. Gandhi did preach brotherhood, but Hindu-Muslim brotherhood was particularly dear to his heart. Mr. Modi thought that was not worth mentioning."

Goa progresses 5-2 on aggregate, meets Bengaluru FC in the final on March 17
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"FC Goa, playing at full strength as promised by coach Sergio Lobera, qualified for its second final in five seasons of the ISL.Breathing free after the tearaway 5-1 win in the away leg against Mumbai City FC, the hosts went down by a stunning Rafael Bastos goal at home in the Nehru stadium on Tuesday. The fans let out a roar at the final whistle, buoyed by the 5-2 aggregate.Mumbai City changed its approach, executing the tactics designed by coach Jorge Costa. Needing to win by a five-goal margin, the visitors did beat Goa goalkeeper Naveen Kumar once on an exciting night under the lights and exited after playing the right game in the wrong match.Issoko’s assistMumbai City, in blue, silenced a sea of orange in the stands just six minutes into the game. Arnold Issoko, the most dangerous player in the first leg, picked up the ball off a misspass, darted ahead, leaped over a defensive challenge before rolling it along the turf for teammate Bastos to glide in on cue and guide the ball into the net.The Congo playmaker and the Brazilian sniper had teamed up to strike first for the visitors in the Mumbai leg, but this time the script took a different twist in the face of a determined Mumbai City rearguard. The defence played close to deny the eager bunch of Goa ball-players a clear view of the target.The home team, applying pressure around the rival goalmouth, earned two free-kicks within striking distance of goal but Brandon Fernandes could not find his man in the goalmouth.A stream of corner kicks, too, did not yield results. Lobera was forced to take out creative ace Ahmed Jahouh, suffering a hand injury, and introduced Edu Bedia. Mumbai City’s physical play helped the side stay in front till half-time.Subashish Bose was a big name missing in the Mumbai defence, paying the price for a collective below-par show by the backline in the first leg when Goa ran riot. The first half saw frenetic action, and the flow changed after the breather as Lobera’s team slowed down the pace and cashed in on speed with the ball to attack in waves.Skipper Amrinder, in the Mumbai City goal, was taken off and the armband given to Paulo Machado. The latter rescued his team twice as the home team came close to equalising in the second half.The result: FC Goa 0 lost to Mumbai City FC 1 (Bastos 6)."

‘Party is going against Gandhian ideals’
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On the 89th anniversary of the historic Dandi salt march, and on a day when the Congress was holding a meeting of the party’s working committee in Ahmedabad, Prime Minister Narendra Modi penned a blog criticising the current culture in the Congress party as being the “antithesis of Gandhian thought”.The blog, released online via Mr. Modi’s Twitter handle, said that the Congress, in its current form, had become synonymous with corruption. Mahatma Gandhi, the Prime Minister said, had “taught us to think of the plight of the poorest person we have seen and think about how our work impacts that person”.Speaking of his own government’s record, he said, he was “proud to say that in all aspects of our government’s work, the guiding consideration is to see how it will alleviate poverty and bring prosperity. Sadly, the antithesis of Gandhian thought is the Congress culture.”‘Society divided’He added that the Mahatma did not believe in inequality and caste divisions but, “Sadly, the Congress has never hesitated from dividing society. The worst caste riots and anti-Dalit massacres happened under Congress rule.”By going against Gandhi’s teachings that held that detachment and staying away from excess wealth was important, “all that the Congress has done is to fill their own bank accounts and lead luxurious lifestyles at the cost of providing basic necessities to the poor,” Mr. Modi said.“The nation has seen how Congress and corruption have become synonyms. Name the sector and there will be a Congress scam — from defence, telecom, irrigation, sporting events to agriculture, rural development and more,” he said.He also said that while ‘Bapu’ (Mahatma Gandhi) despised dynastic politics, “dynasty first” was the way for the Congress today.Hitting out at the Opposition party on the issue of people’s rights, he said that Gandhi believed that democracy gave the weak the same chance as the strong, but the Congress “gave the nation the Emergency, when our democratic spirit was trampled over.”“Gandhi ji had understood the Congress culture very well, which is why he wanted the Congress disbanded, especially after 1947,” the Prime Minister said, adding “Thankfully, today we have a government at the Centre that is working on Bapu’s path.”"

A compromise is still possible,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-compromise-is-still-possible/article26503954.ece,"
But there is need for clarity on the status of one mediator and the efficacy of mediation on Ayodhya
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court’s attempt to maintain Hindu-Muslim harmony through a mediated settlement of the long-standing Babri Masjid dispute deserves appreciation. But it has raised a couple of concerns too. One relates to the choice of a mediator, and the other to the efficacy of mediation at this stage.Mediator neutralityBy definition, a mediator is a neutral third party who facilitates a negotiated settlement between adversarial contenders. Unfortunately, the neutrality of one of the three court-appointed mediators, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, has come into question as some of his public pronouncements in the recent past appear to negate his supposed disinterestedness.A year ago, in an open letter to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had said: “People from both communities who are adamant on following the court’s verdict are also driving the issue to a situation of defeat.” The “best solution”, therefore, is “an out-of-court settlement in which the Muslim bodies come forward and gift one acre of land to the Hindus who in turn will gift five acres of land nearby to the Muslims, to build a better mosque.”He even told Muslims that giving up their claim to the disputed property did not amount to “surrendering this land to the people who demolished the Babri Masjid or to a particular organisation. On the contrary, they are gifting it to the people of India”.Apart from the fact that this position betrays Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s bias in favour of disputants belonging to one religion, it is difficult to understand the justifiability of treating a gift to Hindus as a gift to the people of India. Does he regard only Hindus as “the people of India” to the exclusion of other communities?Nonetheless, it stands to reason that Muslims would be in a position to gift the land only when their ownership of it is confirmed by the Supreme Court. If Muslims lose the case, the entire land would come under the control of Hindus and the question of Muslims giving up their claim would then be rendered redundant.But the Art of Living founder thinks that even a Hindu victory would not be conducive to peace. It could foster Muslim resentment and may “lead to riots throughout the country”, he told the AIMPLB, thereby insinuating that Muslims are violent. He seems to be unaware that Muslims have agreed to abide by the court verdict whichever way it goes. Now that he has been made a mediator, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar must clarify if he still stands by his statements.Advisability of mediationDespite Hindu groups opposing a negotiated settlement, the Supreme Court made it clear that an attempt should be made to settle the dispute by mediation. It overruled their objections by invoking Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) which allows the court to refer any dispute to one of the four modes of non-adjudicatory resolution processes: namely, arbitration, conciliation, judicial settlement (including settlement through Lok Adalat), or mediation. In this case, the court opted for mediation.This was again opposed on the basis of a two-judge Supreme Court judgment inAfcons infrastructure and Ors. v. Cherian Verkay Construction and Ors(2010). It illustratively explained that mediation cannot be done in a representative suit which involves public interest or the interest of large number of persons who are not represented in the court.But the five-Judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi differed. Citing the provisions of Order 1 rule 8 CPC and Order XXIII rule 3-B, it stated that there was no legal impediment to making a reference to mediation. Whether the said CPC provisions would apply in the event parties arrive at a settlement in the mediation proceedings was left open to be decided later.Also, what the Supreme Court had frowned upon inAfconswas a civil court exercising power under Section 89 of the Code to refer a suit for “arbitration” without the concurrence of all the parties to the suit. But the court is free, the Supreme Court had said, to consider and decide upon any non-adjudicatory resolution method other than arbitration such as judicial settlement or mediation.Questions still remain. If the Hindu groups continue to reject mediation, how will this dispute be resolved? And if they agree to negotiate, will the compromise they reach with Muslims be binding on all Hindus in India?Even Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who conceded that a negotiated settlement is most ‘desirable’ in this case, was initially not sure if such a settlement could bind millions of Hindus and Muslims as the issue is not an ordinary dispute between two private parties.Win-win situationIf examined closely, it would be seen that the Babri Masjid dispute is not really an explosive issue affecting the religious sentiments of millions of Hindus and Muslims as has been portrayed. This may have been the case in the initial years after the illegal demolition of the Babri Masjid. But today, more than a quarter century later, such a portrayal should be construed as having entered the realm of political mythopoeia where myths of various kinds are created at the hustings for electoral advantage.The fact is, there is no evidence to show that the handful of parties claiming to represent Hindus and Muslims in this case are fully backed by their respective communities. In other words, the Babri Masjid/Ram Janmabhoomi imbroglio is no longer a life-affirming issue for the Indian masses, who are more concerned about jobs, poverty alleviation and access to affordable housing, health care and education.That said, both communities cannot afford to let the Ayodhya dispute simmer forever and stall the country’s socio-economic growth. The main reason for the unrelenting Muslim attitude is the fear that if they give up their claim on the Babri Masjid, Hindu groups would ask for other “disputed” mosques to be handed over. After all one of the post-demolition kar sevak slogans in 1992 was, “Yeh toh sirf jhanki hai,abKashi, Mathurabaaki hai(This is only the trailer, now Kashi and Mathura remain),” in which Kashi and Mathura are metonyms for two more disputed places of worship.A question of trustIf this Muslim fear is addressed by the Hindu parties to the dispute, and also by influential organisations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the chances of amicably resolving this seemingly intractable conflict would exponentially increase. A collective assurance from the Hindu side that it would not stake claim to any other “disputed” mosque in India could be the face-saving compromise and win-win situation both sides are looking for.A.

Delhi Police seeks more time to fulfil mandatory obligation
",,"The wait for sanction for prosecution of former JNU president Kanhaiya Kumar and others in the sedition case continues with the city police on Monday once again seeking more time from a Delhi court to fulfil the mandatory obligation.Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that no court shall take cognisance of any offence punishable under Chapter VI of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Section 124-A (sedition) of the IPC, under which the accused have been charge-sheeted, is placed under this chapter.The probe agency informed Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Deepak Sherawat that it would take another two-three months to get the sanction from the Delhi government.Stating that he would go ahead with the case, Mr. Sherawat told the police that they could have filed the chargesheet with the prosecution sanction.Report sought from DCPPosting the matter on March 29, Mr. Sherawat asked the Deputy Commissioner of Police dealing with the case to file a report.The probe agency are prosecuting them for allegedly raising anti-India slogans on the university campus in 2016.The Magistrate had on January 19 refused to take cognisance of the chargesheet against the accused, stating that the police filed it without sanction for prosecution.The police had then promised to get the required sanction within 10 days.He had pulled up the Delhi government last month for sitting over the police’s application for sanction.“After filing of the chargesheet, no department can sit on its hands with the file with regard to the sanction. The department concerned can do well to speed up the matter regarding the sanction,” he had said.The accused in the case have been charge-sheeted under Sections 124A (sedition), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 465 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine, forged document), 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly, 149 (unlawful assembly with common object), 147 (rioting) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC."
"Across Baghdad, a moment of respite and guarded hope",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/across-baghdad-a-moment-of-respite-and-guarded-hope/article26496346.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Baghdad’s main commercial district has seen more bombings than its residents can count. Death visited almost daily during times of war most horrifically, a 2015 suicide bombing that ripped through two shopping malls, killing over 300 people.But over the past year or so, the residents of Karrada have felt more normal than they have in decades. Streets lined with food stalls are crowded with shoppers, coffee shops and restaurants are packed until late, and the grey cement blast walls that protected against bombings are being removed.“I used to go to school and come back home, nothing more,” said Rusul Mohsen, a 33-year-old middle school teacher, seated recently at a store front sipping coffee. “If I went to a restaurant, I would ask to sit in a corner the farthest away from any windows, fearing a car bomb explosion might shatter the glass.”For the first time in 15 years there is no major war or insurgency in Iraq, and the defeat of the Islamic State group in late 2017 after a ruinous four-year war has given the population a moment of respite. Despite the enormous challenges ahead, there is a guarded sense of hope across the capital.Car bomb explosions that became the norm after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, making the Iraqi capital’s name synonymous with war, have ceased at least for now. Thousands of concrete barriers that snaked through the city as protection from suicide car bombers have been towed away in trucks, easing traffic.Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool said thousands of barriers have been towed away to a plot of land on the outskirts of the city, saying they may be used in the future around Baghdad to protect against infiltration.Parts of the heavily fortified Green Zone on the west bank of the Tigris River have reopened to the public, including public access to the landmark “Victory Arch” a 40-meter (131-feet) tall arch of two swords held by bronze casts of former dictator Saddam Hussein’s hands to commemorate the Iran-Iraq war.The U.S. established the Green Zone in 2003 to secure its embassy and Iraqi government institutions. But the zone became a symbol of the country’s inequality, fueling the perception among Iraqis that their government is out of touch.On the other side of the river, Baghdad’s famous Rasheed Street, the capital’s oldest street and cultural center known for its crumbling, old Iraqi houses, has also reopened for cars and pedestrians after a 15-year closure due to security risks.A new Central Bank headquarters, a towering waterfront building on the banks of the Tigris designed by the late Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid, is currently under construction, expected to be completed next year.“Baghdad feels better than it has since 2003,” remarked a veteran Western diplomat in Baghdad.Even so, the country faces massive challenges.The Islamic State group, which is about to lose its last shred of territory in neighboring Syria, is creeping back in Iraq, stepping up insurgent-style attacks in areas outside Baghdad and the country’s north. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced and much of the country is in ruins. The country is plagued by corruption, and in the oil-rich but parched south, violent riots have repeatedly broken out against living conditions.Baghdad, an ancient metropolis of 8 million people that was once the Arab world’s cultural center, is barely functional, its infrastructure crumbling. Armed militias who fought IS alongside the Iraqi armed forces roam the streets in what many see as the country’s latest menace, amid reports of kidnappings for ransom and general lawlessness. Unemployment, poverty and disenfranchised youth are widespread.“There is a big gap between people’s aspirations and the government ability to deliver,” the Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity so he could speak freely.Still, many hope that after years of bloodshed, Iraq is starting to turn a corner.In Karrada, the Hadi Center where a 2015 suicide bombing trapped people in a burning inferno for hours, killing around 300 people, is full of shoppers and youngsters fill the food court. The adjacent Laith Center had to be razed and rebuilt from scratch. It’s now almost completed.Assem Gharib, owner of a pastries and ice cream shop, said for years he used to pay someone to supervise the street outside his shop and keep cars from parking in front.“I used to be frightened whenever a car approached, imagining it to be a suicide bomber or a car bomb. Now it’s the opposite, we are happy when a car parks in front of the shop,” he said.That kind of confidence eluded most Iraqis for the past 15 years. The country has been at war, one way or another, for more than a generation, starting with the eight-year Iraq-Iran war that ended in 1988, followed by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent military intervention by the United States.The worst bloodletting came with the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which triggered an al-Qaida driven insurgency and sectarian violence that washed over the country, killing tens of thousands of Iraqis. Bombings reached up to 10 a day.The violence culminated with the Islamic State group, an al-Qaida offshoot, seizing Iraqi cities and declaring a self-styled Islamic caliphate over large parts of Iraq and Syria. That triggered a displacement crisis unprecedented in Iraq’s history. Millions fled their homes in the face of the militants’ rapid advance. Others fled as Iraqi forces, backed by the U.S. and Iran, battled back, ultimately reclaiming the last town in late 2017.Few dare to hope the current lull in fighting will last and many worry fear the growing power of the Shiite militias, known collectively as the Popular Mobilization Forces.Bashar Ali, a 33-year-old shop owner on Karrada street, said he fears the return of IS fighters from Syria and the lawlessness outside the city, including kidnappings and killings.“Baghdad is like my home, I feel safe in my own home, but when I go outside I don’t feel this way,” he said."

The vision of the World Handmade Textile Biennales just got the push it needed at the unveiling of the refurbished Handloom Haat with the support of the Asian Heritage Foundation
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is significant that Handloom Haat, the government’s brick-and-mortar endeavour to create a centre for textile craft and heritage, is on Janpath — ‘the people’s path’ in New Delhi. Because the idea is to connect the weaver with us, the people who have the power to change a livelihood into a profession. To keep our living heritage alive in a changing world.“The idea is to start linking people to their histories and legacies,” says Sujata Prasad, who retired as an Additional Secretary from the Ministry of Culture. She now serves as an advisor to the Crafts Museum. She leads me through the exhibition, bringing every piece alive.Some are from her own collection (like the kalamkari piece that tells the complete Ramayana), several from the Crafts Museum (like the phulkari) and from mastercraftsmen themselves (like Rohit and Rahul Salvi’s silk patan patola). Each piece is well-labelled and tells us a little about the craft, the piece, and details of the weaver.The exhibition itself is divided into five zones: Chintz, Ikat, Embroidery, Brocade, and Khadi. Each will, in the future, evolve into a different biennale in the area from where it originates: the World Khadi Biennale in Ahmedabad (December 2019), Brocade in Varanasi (September 2020), Ikat in Hyderabad (June 2021), and Chintz in Jaipur (March 2022), Embroidery in Srinagar (November 2022). At the exhibit, the idea is also to connect similar craft forms from across the world. Each section has maps indicating where else the craft is practiced — there is Ikat in Indonesia and Turkmenistan, for instance.Weavers, designers, buyers from apparel and interiors spaces, and technologists, will all be a part of it. “It is a destination event,” says Ramesh Prasanna, cultural entrepreneur and Director — International Alliances, Government Interface and Media, from the Biennales team. He calls it textile and cultural tourism, which, like the Kochi Biennale will have different elements scattered across the city.Prasad, who is an advisor to the Biennale, of which the Asian Heritage Foundation is the custodian, is looking forward to collecting the ‘smaller’ histories — the narrative of the bigger traditions is known and has been told, she says. But a family that sings its own song as it weaves, will now be able to give the world a glimpse not just of the cloth, but also of the lives they lead.At the exhibition, you will find a double-ikat telia rumal wall hanging with 100 non-repetitive motifs a bright orange Chettinad saris in natural dyes, along with pieces from textile researcher Rta Kapur Chishti’s personal jamdani collection and much more. It’s not just the old though; there are contemporary pieces and motifs too, and weavers have experimented with fabrics they hadn’t traditionally used.In the midst of it all, there are three of craftsperson Sarojben Rathore’s patchwork pieces that provide context to life as she’s seen in it:‘The Earthquake in Gujarat’, ‘Gujarat Communal Riots’, ‘A Life in an Ideal Village — Gojul Gaam’.The exhibition is brought together, though perhaps unwittingly, by a khadi pieces that cover the bright lights overhead. There’s more of the material draped over the large windows, shielding the pieces from harsh sunrays.Through his five decades of work in culture, Rajeev Sethi, — the founder-chairperson of the Asian Heritage Foundation and a Biennale mentor — says he’s been concerned that handmade may be subsumed in the onslaught of machines and fakes. “If one really wants to be a conscious consumer, one must appreciate the effort that has gone into evolving these traditions…We need to understand why an ikat is pre-loom, a brocade is on the loom, and that chintz or embroideries are post the loom,” he says. The Biennale is just a beginning."

Poll in 3 seats delayed by court case
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On April 18, when Tamil Nadu votes in the Lok Sabha elections, voters in 18 Assembly constituencies, where byelections will be simultaneously held, would decide the fate of the Edappadi K Palaniswami-led AIADMK government that is ruling with a wafer thin majority in a House, whose strength has been reduced from 234 to 213.The AIADMK has 114 legislators, excluding that of the Speaker, and has to win at least in about 10 seats to remain comfortably in power till the end of this government’s term in May 2021.Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo told journalists on Sunday that though 21 Assembly seats were vacant, bypolls will not be held in Tirupparankundram, Aravakurichi and Ottapidaram (SC) constituencies as election petitions filed by individuals are pending in court.In the immediate future, post-bypoll, the strength of the House would go up to 231, which means that the AIADMK would technically have to win in just two more seats to cross the half-way mark of 116. However, with the AIADMK legislators in Aranthangi, Virudhachalam and Kallakurichi joining the TTV Dhinakaran camp and two other legislators elected on the ‘Two Leaves’ symbol — Thamimun Ansari and Karunaas — turning against the government, the ruling party has to strain every nerve to win as many seats as possible to retain power.Also, the byelection to the remaining three seats would be held eventually when the court settles the issue or if the petitioners withdraw their case. Considering that 17 of the 18 constituencies (except Thiruvarur) where bypoll would be held were won by the AIADMK in May 2016, it will also be a test of popularity for the ruling party.While 18 of the 21 constituencies had fallen vacant following the disqualification of dissident AIADMK MLAs; Thiruvarur and Tirupparankundram fell vacant after the death of M Karunanidhi (DMK) and A K Bose (AIADMK). In Hosur, a vacancy was created due to the disqualification of former Minister Balakrishna Reddy following his conviction in a rioting case.

A compromise is still possible: on Ayodhya dispute,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-compromise-is-still-possible/article26502542.ece,"
But there is need for clarity on the status of one mediator and the efficacy of mediation on Ayodhya ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court’s attempt to maintain Hindu-Muslim harmonythrough a mediated settlementof the long-standing Babri Masjid dispute deserves appreciation. But it has raised a couple of concerns too. One relates to the choice of a mediator, and the other to the efficacy of mediation at this stage.Mediator neutralityBy definition, a mediator is a neutral third party who facilitates a negotiated settlement between adversarial contenders. Unfortunately, the neutrality of one of the three court-appointed mediators, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, has come into question as some of his public pronouncements in the recent past appear to negate his supposed disinterestedness.A year ago, in an open letter to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had said: “People from both communities who are adamant on following the court’s verdict are also driving the issue to a situation of defeat.” The “best solution”, therefore, is “an out-of-court settlement in which the Muslim bodies come forward and gift one acre of land to the Hindus who in turn will gift five acres of land nearby to the Muslims, to build a better mosque.”Also ReadAyodhya title dispute: Who are the mediators appointed by the Supreme Court?He even told Muslims that giving up their claim to the disputed property did not amount to “surrendering this land to the people who demolished the Babri Masjid or to a particular organisation. On the contrary, they are gifting it to the people of India”.Apart from the fact that this position betrays Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s bias in favour of disputants belonging to one religion, it is difficult to understand the justifiability of treating a gift to Hindus as a gift to the people of India. Does he regard only Hindus as “the people of India” to the exclusion of other communities?Nonetheless, it stands to reason that Muslims would be in a position to gift the land only when their ownership of it is confirmed by the Supreme Court. If Muslims lose the case, the entire land would come under the control of Hindus and the question of Muslims giving up their claim would then be rendered redundant.But the Art of Living founder thinks that even a Hindu victory would not be conducive to peace. It could foster Muslim resentment and may “lead to riots throughout the country”, he told the AIMPLB, thereby insinuating that Muslims are violent. He seems to be unaware that Muslims have agreed to abide by the court verdict whichever way it goes. Now that he has been made a mediator, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar must clarify if he still stands by his statements.Advisability of mediationDespite Hindu groups opposing a negotiated settlement, the Supreme Court made it clear that an attempt should be made to settle the dispute by mediation. It overruled their objections by invoking Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) which allows the court to refer any dispute to one of the four modes of non-adjudicatory resolution processes: namely, arbitration, conciliation, judicial settlement (including settlement through Lok Adalat), or mediation. In this case, the court opted for mediation.Also ReadStrange turn: on SC's order regarding Ayodhya disputeThis was again opposed on the basis of a two-judge Supreme Court judgment inAfcons infrastructure and Ors. v. Cherian Verkay Construction and Ors(2010). It illustratively explained that mediation cannot be done in a representative suit which involves public interest or the interest of large number of persons who are not represented in the court.But the five-Judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi differed. Citing the provisions of Order 1 rule 8 CPC and Order XXIII rule 3-B, it stated that there was no legal impediment to making a reference to mediation. Whether the said CPC provisions would apply in the event parties arrive at a settlement in the mediation proceedings was left open to be decided later.Also, what the Supreme Court had frowned upon inAfconswas a civil court exercising power under Section 89 of the Code to refer a suit for “arbitration” without the concurrence of all the parties to the suit. But the court is free, the Supreme Court had said, to consider and decide upon any non-adjudicatory resolution method other than arbitration such as judicial settlement or mediation.Questions still remain. If the Hindu groups continue to reject mediation, how will this dispute be resolved? And if they agree to negotiate, will the compromise they reach with Muslims be binding on all Hindus in India?Even Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who conceded that a negotiated settlement is most ‘desirable’ in this case, was initially not sure if such a settlement could bind millions of Hindus and Muslims as the issue is not an ordinary dispute between two private parties.Win-win situationIf examined closely, it would be seen that the Babri Masjid dispute is not really an explosive issue affecting the religious sentiments of millions of Hindus and Muslims as has been portrayed. This may have been the case in the initial years after the illegal demolition of the Babri Masjid. But today, more than a quarter century later, such a portrayal should be construed as having entered the realm of political mythopoeia where myths of various kinds are created at the hustings for electoral advantage.The fact is, there is no evidence to show that the handful of parties claiming to represent Hindus and Muslims in this case are fully backed by their respective communities. In other words, the Babri Masjid/Ram Janmabhoomi imbroglio is no longer a life-affirming issue for the Indian masses, who are more concerned about jobs, poverty alleviation and access to affordable housing, health care and education.That said, both communities cannot afford to let the Ayodhya dispute simmer forever and stall the country’s socio-economic growth. The main reason for the unrelenting Muslim attitude is the fear that if they give up their claim on the Babri Masjid, Hindu groups would ask for other “disputed” mosques to be handed over. After all one of the post-demolition kar sevak slogans in 1992 was, “Yeh toh sirf jhanki hai,abKashi, Mathurabaaki hai(This is only the trailer, now Kashi and Mathura remain),” in which Kashi and Mathura are metonyms for two more disputed places of worship.A question of trustIf this Muslim fear is addressed by the Hindu parties to the dispute, and also by influential organisations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the chances of amicably resolving this seemingly intractable conflict would exponentially increase. A collective assurance from the Hindu side that it would not stake claim to any other “disputed” mosque in India could be the face-saving compromise and win-win situation both sides are looking for.A.

Power and communications outages continues to hit Venezuela
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Venezuelan Opposition and government loyalists held rival demonstrations in Caracas on Saturday, as both sides prepared for what some fear could be a protracted power struggle.The rallies unfolded as power and communications outages continued to hit Venezuela, intensifying the hardship of a country paralysed by economic and political crisis. The blackouts heightened tension between the bitterly divided factions, which accused each other of being responsible for the collapse of the power grid.“Hard times are ahead,” said Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who addressed crowds with a loudspeaker after security forces earlier dismantled a speakers’ stage that the Opposition had erected. He said he planned to tour Venezuela to seek support and lay the groundwork for a massive rally in Caracas.The 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly said he anticipated more government efforts to sideline and intimidate the Opposition. However, President Nicolas Maduro’s government has not moved directly against Mr. Guaido since he returned to Venezuela from a Latin American tour Monday.Mr. Guaido earlier speculated that Mr. Maduro was effectively ignoring him in an attempt to sap the energy of the Opposition, whose hopes of ousting the government have so far been stymied.But on Saturday, Mr. Maduro stepped up verbal attacks on Mr. Guaido, calling him “a clown and puppet” in a speech to supporters outside Miraflores, the Presidential palace. He scoffed at Mr. Guaido’s claim in late January to be interim President of Venezuela, a declaration supported by the United States and about 50 other countries.“Not a President, not anything,” said Mr. Maduro, who accused Mr. Guaido and his U.S. allies of sabotaging Venezuela’s Guri Dam, one of the world’s largest hydroelectric stations and the cornerstone of Venezuela’s electrical grid.The Venezuelan Opposition and U.S. officials say Mr. Maduro’s attempts to pin blame on his political adversaries is absurd, and that government corruption and mismanagement over many years caused the blackout and wider deterioration of the economy.Explosion at power stationIn another blow to Venezuela’s infrastructure, an explosion occurred at a power station in the country’s Bolivar state on March 9, according to local media. Video posted on social media showed fire and smoke billowing from the site. Venezuelan authorities have not commented.A man tries to extinguish a motorcycle on fire during a protest against the government of Nicolas Maduro on March 9, 2019 in Caracas, Venezuela.  
| Photo Credit:Getty ImagesNetblocks, a non-government group based in Europe that monitors internet censorship, said Saturday that the second outage had knocked out almost all of Venezuela’s telecommunications infrastructure.Earlier, it referred to online connectivity data indicating that the initial outage that began Thursday and eased about 24 hours later was the largest on recent record in Latin America.Managers of the Caracas subway said they were waiting for the electricity supply to stabilise before resuming service, and the power grid problems quickly became only another issue that galvanised Venezuelans to take to the streets.Hyperinflation and shortage of basic necessitiesOpposition protesters who converged on Avenida Victoria in Caracas vented anger over the country’s problems, including hyperinflation and shortages of basic necessities. They pushed against the shields of riot police who avoided a clash by withdrawing from the area.Some protesters elsewhere in the city said police tried to block them from reaching the rally, creating a sense of confusion as power and communications outages plagued the country.“This is chaos,” said Jorge Jaimes, a physician frustrated with the decline of a country that was once the wealthiest in Latin America.At the pro-government rally, people danced and waved flags on what organisers labelled a “day of anti-imperialism” in a show of defiance toward the United States, which has imposed oil sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to oust Mr. Maduro. Many showed up wearing red caps and shirts in support of the self-proclaimed “socialist revolution” of leader Hugo Chavez, who died six years ago and was succeeded by his protégé, Mr. Maduro."

The vision of the World Handmade Textile Biennales just got the direction and drive it needed with the unveiling of refurbished Handloom Haat and the support of the government
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is significant that Handloom Haat, the government’s brick-and-mortar endeavour to create a centre for textile craft and heritage, is on Janpath — ‘the people’s path’. Because the idea is to connect the weaver with us, the people who have the power to change a mere livelihood into a profession.To keep our living heritage alive in a changing world.“The idea is to start linking people to their histories and legacies,” says Sujata Prasad, who retired as an Additional Secretary from the Ministry of Culture. She now serves as an advisor to the Crafts Museum. She leads me through the exhibition, bringing every piece alive.Some are from her own collection (like the kalamkari piece that tells the complete Ramayana), several from the Crafts Museum (like the phulkari) and from mastercraftsmen themselves (like Rohit and Rahul Salvi’s silk patan patola). Each piece is well-labelled and tells us a little about the craft, the piece, and details of the weaver.The exhibition itself is divided into five zones: Chintz, Ikat, Embroidery, Brocade, and Khadi. Each will, in the future, evolve into a different biennale in the area from where it originates: the World Khadi Biennale in Ahmedabad (October 2019), Brocade in Varanasi (September 2020), Chintz in Jaipur (December 2020), Ikat in Hyderabad (February 2021), and Embroidery in Srinagar (June 2021). At the exhibit, the idea is also to connect similar craft forms from across the world — in each section, there are maps indicating where else the craft is practiced — there is Ikat in Indonesia and Turkmenistan, for instanceWeavers, designers, buyers from apparel and interiors spaces, and technologists, will all be a part of it. “It is a destination event,” says Ramesh Prasanna, cultural entrepreneur and Director – International Alliances, Government Interface and Media, from the Biennales team. He calls it textile and cultural tourism, which, like the Kochi Biennale will have different elements scattered across the city.Rajeev SethiPrasad, who is an advisor to the Biennale, of which the Asian Heritage Foundation is the custodian, is looking forward to collecting the ‘smaller’ histories — the narrative of the bigger traditions is known and has been told, she says. But a family that sings its own song as it weaves, will now be able to give the world a glimpse not just of the cloth, but also of the lives they lead.At the exhibition, you will find a double-ikat telia rumal wall hanging with 100 non-repetitive motifs a bright orange Chettinad saris in natural dyes, along with pieces from textile researcher Rta Kapur Chishti’s personal jamdani collection and much more. It’s not just the old though; there are contemporary pieces and motifs too, and weavers have experimented with fabrics they hadn’t traditionally used.In the midst of it all, there are three of craftsperson Sarojben Rathore’s patchwork pieces that provide context to life as she’s seen in it:‘The Earthquake in Gujarat’, ‘Gujarat Communal Riots’, ‘A Life in an Ideal Village — Gojul Gaam’.The exhibition is brought together, though perhaps unwittingly, by a khadi pieces that cover the bright lights overhead. There’s more of the material draped over the large windows, shielding the pieces from harsh sunrays.Through his five decades of work in culture, Rajeev Sethi, — a trustee with the Asian Heritage Foundation and now a Biennale mentor — says he’s been concerned that handmade may be subsumed in the onslaught of machines and fakes. “If one really wants to be a conscious consumer, one must appreciate the effort that has gone into evolving these traditions…We need to understand why an ikat is pre-loom, a brocade is on the loom, and that chintz or embroideries are post the loom,” he says. The Biennale is just a beginning."

His government faced some unprecedented challenges, such as the floods in 2018 and the implementation of the Supreme Court order to allow young women to visit the Sabarimala temple. Mr. Vijayan speaks of those challenges and his government’s development agenda. Excerpts:Kerala witnessed one of the worst floods in its history in 2018. What is the status of rebuilding activities?During the floods, we gave priority to rescue operations and relief activities. We were able to rescue more than 1,63,000 people from August 17 to 20. Around 1.5 million were shifted to around 4,000 relief shelters across Kerala. The State government has provided, for 7,00,000 families, Rs. 10,000 each as immediate financial assistance. Today, we are mainly focussing on the reconstruction of damaged houses and roads. A total of 13,362 houses were fully damaged in the floods. The first instalment of financial assistance has been distributed for the reconstruction of 9,341 houses. The cooperative sector will rebuild 2,000 houses. The government has identified and sought support of sponsors for the construction of rest of the houses. I am hopeful that we will complete this process before the end of this financial year.How do you look at the whole Sabarimala agitation?The State submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court, stating that whatever may be the court verdict, the government would abide by that and would implement it. So it is the fundamental responsibility of the State government to implement the verdict. Look at the initial response to the verdict; the AICC, the Opposition leader, BJP State president and the RSS all accepted it.Unfortunately, after this, the same people started openly challenging our Constitution. Their ultimate aim was to disturb and malign Kerala’s secular mind and orchestrate a religious riot.Many devotees don’t favour the entry of women in the menstruation age. Do you think your government has succeeded in communi-cating your position?The most important thing to remember is that the Communist party was never part of the legal discourse on this issue. It was actually the devotees themselves who approached the honourable judiciary to either ban the women entry or lift the restriction. After the Supreme Court verdict, we have consistently said that it is not the job of our party or the State government to ‘recruit’ women to Sabarimala. On the other hand, we have taken a clear stand that it is the duty of the State government to give necessary protection for anybody who visits Sabarimala based on the Supreme Court verdict and their individual faith. We have seen massive participation of general public, including women, in the LDF’s political meetings on the issue. We have also seen huge participation of women in the “women’s wall” for gender justice. All of this shows that we have been successful in communicating our stand to the common people.As Kerala is the only Left- ruled State now, could you talk about alternative policies you could introduce?We have been successful in making the public sector enterprises under the Kerala government profitable within one year after coming into power, besides taking over PSEs which have been disinvested by the Centre. Whereas the Central government has withdrawn from the social sector, the Kerala government actively intervenes; for example, the pension rates we provide are the highest.Newspapers report that the number of jobs created has decreased in the country after [Narendra] Modi came to power. But our government gave appointment to 1 lakh youngsters through the public service commission. We also created 20,000 posts in the same period. Our government has succeeded in increasing wage and other benefits in more than 80% of the labour sector. We implemented a Bill giving employees the right to sit and work, and intervened in raising nurses’ salaries.(Jipson John and Jitheesh P.M are fellows at Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research)Read the full interview at http://bit.ly/PinarayiVijayanOur government gave appointment to 1 lakh youngsters through the public service commissionPinarayi Vijayan"

FIR registered to intimidate us, say organisers of November 2018 protest
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The adivasi farmers’ protest march from Thane to Mumbai in November last year, has become a bone of contention between the Mumbai Police and the Loksangharsh Morcha, which organised the march.According to members of the Loksangharsh Morcha, the Azad Maidan police have registered an FIR against them to intimidate them. Firoz Mithborwala, an organiser, said, “We were served notices by the Azad Maidan police on Tuesday, in the middle of a press conference that we had organised to voice our questions regarding the Pulwama and Balakot attacks. This is an attempt to intimidate all activists who support the struggling farmer, and all those asking questions that challenge the official version of the events in Pulwama and Balakot.”The notices issued to Mr. Mithborwala, Smita Salunkhe, Afroz Mallik, Ravi Bhilani, and Jyoti Bandekar stated that an FIR was filed against them on November 23, a day after the march, for unlawful assembly, attempting to overawe the government by criminal force, or show of criminal force and wanton provocation with intent to cause riots under the Indian Penal Code. It also stated that all the five activists will need to be arrested.“The police have asked us to come to court on March 22. Adivasis and farmers are standing with us. The march was completely legal and the State government even arranged for special trains to take protesters back to their hometowns. Why, then, have the police suddenly termed it unlawful?” Mr. Mithborwala asked.The police, however, said that the protest march was in violation of the law and that the FIR was legally justified. “There are guidelines laid down by the Honourable Bombay High Court that forbid a protest march on foot through the city. We had clearly communicated to theorganisers that they could protest at Azad Maidan but not march through the city, which they ignored. Our action is in accordance with the letter of the law,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone I) Abhishek Trimukhe said.The Loksangharsh Morcha will be addressing a press conference on March 13 over the issue."

In conversation with the Chief Minister who just completed 1,000 days in office
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Pinarayi Vijayan, the Chief Minister of Kerala, just completed 1,000 days in office. During this time, his government faced some unprecedented challenges such as the floods in 2018 and the implementation of the Supreme Court order to allow young women to visit the Sabarimala temple. In this interview, Mr. Vijayan speaks of those challenges and his government’s development agenda.Excerpts:Kerala has witnessed one of the worst floods in its history in 2018. What’s the present status of rebuilding activities? How long it will take to complete the rebuilding process?The reconstruction bid is really a mammoth and unparalleled task. It will take two-three years to complete the task. During the floods, we gave priority for rescue operations and relief activities. We were able to rescue more than 1,63,000 people from August 17 to 20. Around 1.5 million were shifted to around 4,000 relief shelters across Kerala. The State government has provided, for 700,000 families, ₹10000 rupees each as immediate financial assistance.Today, we are mainly focusing on the reconstruction of damaged houses and roads. A total of 13,362 houses were fully damaged in the floods. The first installment of financial assistance has been distributed for the reconstruction of 9,341 houses. The cooperative sector will rebuild 2,000 houses. The government has identified and sought support of sponsors for the construction of rest of the houses.A total of 1,075 landless families have lost their houses in the flood. We have identified suitable land for them. In the flood 2,42,602 houses were partially damaged. Among these, 1,21,265 beneficiaries have got the first financial installment... I am hopeful that we will complete this process before the end of this financial year.Did Kerala get necessary help from the Union government for the post-flood rebuilding?The actual loss incurred by the State in the flood amounts to ₹31,000 crore. This is equal to the total amount of the annual plan of the State. But according to the criteria of the Union government, we are eligible to ask for just ₹5,000 crore. Even this amount is not allocated for us. It also remains that we are not allowed to accept the volunteer help offered by the foreign countries. Our Ministers are denied permission by the Union government from visiting non-resident Malayalees to raise fund for reconstruction. The State government also hasn’t got any written permission from the centre to raise our borrowing capacity.The implementation of GST and other policies have really curbed the financial autonomy of State governments. The situation also doesn’t not exist to raise our own tax revenue. Today, we need a real rethinking of central-State economic relations in the direction of assuring enough resource allocation and economic assistance for the States. It is only then that our federal structure would work in a manner suiting the interests of both the Central and State governments.How do you look at the whole Sabarimala agitation? There were allegations that the government failed to consider the sentiments of the devotees while implementing the Supreme Court order...From the beginning itself the government’s position is that it would uphold the principles of the Constitution and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The State has submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court, stating that whatever may be the court verdict, the government would abide by that and would implement it. So it is the fundamental responsibility of the State government to implement the verdict. Look at the initial response when the verdict came; everybody including the AICC [All India Congress Committee], the Opposition leader [in Kerala], BJP State president and the RSS have all accepted it. Some people even called it a historical judgment. They also said, even before me, that the government has legal obligation to implement it.Unfortunately, after this, the same people started openly challenging our Constitution. Their ultimate aim was to disturb and malign Kerala’s secular mind and orchestrate a religious riot. Even those who claim themselves as the champions of secularism fell in that trap. But the people of Kerala realised these things and stood firm in the spirit of secularism. People at large kept themselves restrained and resisted the efforts to orchestrate religious riot in the state.A large number of devotees don’t favour the entry of women in the menstruation age into Sabarimala. Do you think your government has succeeded in communicating your position on this issue with the larger section of society?Different Left governments holding office before the High Court verdict of 1991 never tried to prevent the entry of menstruating women into Sabarimala. In the same way, Left governments never acted in opposition against the High Court verdict of 1991, which restricted the women entry. The most important thing to remember is that the Communist party was never part of the legal discourse on this issue. It was actually the devotees themselves who approached the honourable judiciary to either ban the women entry or lift the restriction. After the Supreme Court verdict, we have consistently said that it is not the job of our party or the state government to ‘recruit’ women to Sabarimala.On the other hand, we have taken a clear stand that it is the duty of the State government to give necessary protection for anybody who visit Sabarimala based on the Supreme Court verdict and their individual faith. We have seen massive participation of general public, including women, in the LDF’s political meetings on the Sabarimala issue. We have also seen huge participation of women belonging to different faiths in the “women’s wall” for gender justice. All of this shows that we have been successful in communicating our stand with the common people.How effective was your government’s response in maintaining law and order in the wake of protests and frequent hartals over the Sabarimala issue?The government has taken strict action against the perpetrators of violence across the State. Protest has even reached to the level of throwing bomb at a police station. Media persons were also brutally attacked. Most of the culprits arrested in these cases are Sangh Parivar activists. The most bizarre thing that we see today is that the same Sangh Parivar organisations campaigning that devotees should not do any offering to temples including Sabarimala are on a fund collection drive to deal with their cases. In Kerala, they tried to use the same technique they practice in other parts of the country.This is the technique of orchestrating religious enmity and riot in order to garner political gains. But Ayappa devotees themselves and the people of Kerala at large have realised their motive now. We should not forget the fact that the same time when these forces were engaged in violence in the name of Sabarimala, the pilgrimage was going on smoothly.The BJP leadership has officially conceded and confirmed that they are winding up their protest due to lack of enough support. It means that they failed to achieve what they aimed at. This defeat of Sangh Parivar is a result of the collective resistance shown by the people of Kerala.What is your take on the argument that the restriction on women’s entry in the Sabarimala temple is part of religious custom? How do you view the Supreme Court judgment?The renaissance movement and social reformers have taught us that superstitious beliefs and customs should be challenged and opposed. Modern Kerala is a product of the selfless social service of great visionaries. The nation’s Constitution is supreme and above all, the customs and beliefs. In the verdict, the Supreme Court has clearly spelled out that any violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution can’t be allowed. All governments, come into power based on the constitutional principles, are obliged to uphold the constitution as supreme.The Left government is into its third year. How do you assess the government's performance?We have actually announced a 35-point programme and succeeded in completing most of them in time. The basic emphasis was on the development of infrastructure. The GAIL pipeline project, the LNG terminal, Kochi Metro, Water Metro, National water way, Kannur International Airport, Vizhinjam port, Hill Highway and coastal highway projects are some of the major projects we have concentrated on.Four flagship missions (Ardram, Life, Haritha Keralam, Public education protection drive) launched by this government are implementing with success. As part of this, we can see a major jump in educational and health sectors. Before we complete our term in office we will provide home for every family in Kerala. No one will remain homeless.Our effort is to create enough jobs in our State itself for the qualified and educated youth. In order to achieve this goal, we are utilising the opportunities in the IT filed. The government is also taking measures to create new jobs by strengthening the public sector and the traditional sector. The amount of social welfare pensions increased as highest rate in the country level .This could be emulated by other States also.In a historic move we have appointed, for the first time, Dalits and other backward caste people as priests in the Devaswom Board-owned temples. I would like to add that the Kerala government has done more than any government could do in 1,000 days. In the coming days our main focus will be on post-flood rebuilding and also on production and industrial sector.The Left generally talks about and aim at an alternative development path. As Kerala is the only Left ruling State now, could you talk about the alternative policies you could introduce?When the central government tries to disinvest the public sector enterprises, we try to empower them. We have been successful in making the public sector enterprises under Kerala government profitable within one year after coming into power. Along with this, we are taking over public enterprises which are disinvested by the Central government in Kerala. When the Central government try to privatise the education sector, the schools in Kerala have been upgraded as the best in the country.When the central government withdraw from the social sector, the Kerala government actively intervened in social welfare measures and also provide social welfare pension at the highest rate in the country.Newspapers report that the number of jobs created has decreased in the country after [Narendra] Modi came to power. But in Kerala, our government gave appointment to 1 lakh youngsters through the public service commission. We also created 20,000 new posts in the same period.Our government has also succeeded in increasing wage and other benefits in more than 80% of the labour sector. We could also implement a Bill giving employees the right to sit and work, intervened in raising the salary of nurses and also intervened in the plantation sector. The four missions that we have set up basically aim to bring structural changes with an alternative development outlook.On January 1, Kerala saw a 627-km long Women’s Wall. What was the reason behind the government’s decision to have such an event?It was not actually the government’s decision to organise the women wall. Instead, the idea emerged in a meeting of different community and progressive organisations convened by the State government. Immediately after the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala, there was a dangerous and regressive effort, in the name of custom and belief, to tarnish the progressive achievements of Kerala. Against the court verdict of upholding gender equality, there were efforts to bring in public women and claim themselves as impure. Gender and caste-based defamation reached into the level of violent attacks.There took place incidences of attack, in public, against women. These events necessitated organised resistance against these forces. It was in this context that the State government initiated a meeting of progressive organisations. In this meeting, representatives of 170 organisations participated and the idea of women wall emerged. The basic objectives of women wall were the slogans of protecting renaissance values, ensuring gender equality, not allowing Kerala to become a lunatic asylum. Kerala wholeheartedly welcomed this initiative and around 5.5 million women joined in the wall from Kasaragode to Thiruvananthapuram.The CPI(M) is in favour of reservation for economically backward classes among the forward castes. The other argument is that economic reservation is against the spirit of our Constitution. What’s your take?Reservation is necessary in the Indian context in order to empower the historically marginalised castes. At the same time, there are thousands in the general category too who face economic difficulties. Reservation for the socially backward castes should be continued as such. But relief should be provided for economically backward sections of the upper castes.The Supreme Court has maintained that reservation should not cross the 50% mark. We can’t accept any move from any quarter that would reverse the constitutionally guaranteed reservation. Such efforts would result in enmity between different communities or even result in clashes between communities.Introducing reservation for economically weaker sections of the general category should not affect the existing reservation. In the appointments to the posts under Travancore Devaswom Board, we have ensured that it would not affect reservation of the existing communities or violate the 50% cap.Aggressive right-wing nationalism registers significant growth in different parts of the world. In India too we see such an upsurge or emboldening of such forces. How the organised Left would resist this?The Kerala society maintains a unique secular mindset. This secular social formation is a result of numerous struggles led by the communist movements and other progressive forces. Because of this historical legacy, Kerala still keeps away these right wing forces. Discredited with having no popular support in society, they try to show their might and influence people through their muscle power. We have seen violence and aggression in the Sabarimala protests. But unlike other States, the Hindu rightwing forces were not able to gain much influence in Kerala due to the strong resistance offered by the Left.In a pan-Indian context, the communist movements and the Left pursue many folded battles against neo-liberalism and communalism. It is because of this strong stand on these two fronts that we are continuously targeted and attacked by the ruling classes in different parts of the country. In West Bengal and Tripura, you could see it in open eye. Recently, CPI(M) leader Brinda Sahni who was in the frontline of land struggles in Bihar was brutally killed by those who protect the interests of the landlord classes. All this shows that we pose a real political challenge to the communal forces in the country.You talked about creating employment opportunities? Has your government succeeded in creating enough jobs for the State’s youth?The principle aim and policy of this government is to create enough employment opportunities for the educated in Kerala itself. It is in tune with this aim that our government involves in IT and other sectors. As part of this, around 2,000 new start-ups have begun operation after this government came to power. We have a policy of using science and technology for social progress and human welfare. The prospects of health, tourism, etc. in job creation is also being explored.We are making a new jump in the production of electrical vehicles. Materialisation of the Virology Institute and Life Science Park opens up new possibilities based on knowledge. Making profitable the public enterprises and reviving the traditional industrial sectors have increased job opportunities in the State. We have also got a strong cooperative sector. The possibilities of increasing the productivity of agriculture and fisheries sector also offer opportunities for the State.The agriculture sector was one of the main areas to focus on post-flood rebuilding. How do you deal with the challenges agriculture faces?Our objective is to attain self sufficiency in agriculture. We have launched Harita Keralam mission as part of this. We were moving into self-sufficiency in the field of milk, vegetable and egg production. Unfortunately, the havoc caused by the flood stalled our efforts in this direction. Heavy rainfall and flood caused structural changes in the soil character. So we need detailed a study of these issues before beginning cultivation. We have launched an action plan to protect the biodiversity. Flood level is also digitally marked.On the basis of this, we could start production activities suitable for our environment. Along with the objective of increasing agricultural production, we also aim to increase the scope for agricultural related business activities in the State. We have great scope for value addition and processing of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish etc. This will ensure more income for the farmer.It is the wrong trade policies of the central government which cause for price collapse and international competition. Removing import restrictions on rubber caused for huge slash in its price for domestic farmers. The Union government didn’t take any action in the direction of creating price stability fund for rubber. But in our State, we have created such a fund worth of ₹500 crore. The fall in pepper price is also a result of such wrong policies pursued by the Central government.The Lok Sabha election is on the door step. How do you analyse the political situation? What is your party’s main agenda in this election?We have a situation in the country where the BJP and the RSS try to crumble the basic edifice of our country. The assault on constitutional bodies and autonomous institutions is unprecedented. We have a situation where four senior judges of the Supreme Court came out against interventions in the functioning of the apex court.We also know what is happening with the CBI. It is a serious matter that an autonomous body like the Central Vigilance Commission played a part in the Central government’s intervention in matters of the CBI. In higher education institutions and research institutes, people without enough qualification and people with complete obedience to the ruling establishment are appointed.Myths are being presented as science and facts become causality. Even the right to privacy of the individuals is breached. So in this context, the coming election assumes much significance in protecting the basic idea of India.The current government is one of the most anti-people governments in the history of this country. Minorities, Dalits, peasants, students, writers, working class have suffered the worst consequences of the Modi government. They have turned into active protest against this government. The general sentiment in the country is now against the BJP and the RSS. Recent assembly elections and bye-elections in different States show that. The same will be reflected in the coming election too.As far as the CPI(M) is concerned, our primary aim is to defeat the BJP. Both the BJP and the Congress are equally enthusiastic about implementing neoliberal policies in the country. If you look in this way, then we could understand that two parties are both sides of the same coin. Both these parties also use communal sentiments in different ways and degrees. The BJP pursues communal politics more aggressively and also, as they are led by the RSS, there is great danger of fascism involved in their politics. Because of this, our primary aim is to defeat the BJP. For which we will adopt political tactics according to the prevailing political situation in each State.For the Left, politics is a way of conducting ideological struggles. We could build a better world only through such struggles. Our political activities have been oriented towards this objective. It is the communist parties and Left movements which have led the struggles of peasants, workers and students in the last years.These struggles have really influenced in shaping popular mood against the RSS and the BJP. We have also registered electoral success in places where we are able to widen and consolidate our support base through these struggles. So we are very confident about the future.Don’t you think that the coming general election will also be a test of your government in Kerala?The Lok Sabha election is an opportunity to evaluate the Union government and also the national politics. I have already explained what the State government has done for the people of Kerala. The people have realised from their experience the difference between present Kerala and what was the situation two and a half years ago.In the same period, we have also actively involved in checking regressive efforts aimed at backtracking the achievements of the State. Along with maintaining the progressive nature of society, we have also succeeded in maintaining people’s unity. So the people of Kerala know well about which political force is leading Kerala towards progress. Because of this, we are confident and hopeful about the election result.Jipson John and Jitheesh P.M are fellows at Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research"

The festival for the community and by the community aims to keep alive our rich heritage, culture and tradition.Last Saturday, the streets of Thiruvellikenni was brimming with the old and the young, as they came together to celebrate one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Chennai and its undying community spirit.Thiruvallikeni Thiruvizha, which was organised by Shree Utsav was founded by three women — Shobana Narasimhan, Uthra Saragarajan and Varsha Narayanan — with the aim of preserving the social history and cultural heritage of Triplicane.The two-day celebration began with a cookery competition on March 2. The next day, it was a riot of colour on the street, as the residents competed with each other to create the best rangoli.Later, a procession was taken out from Bharathiar Illam and passed through the main streets around Parthasarathy Temple.The younger generation were introduced to the heritage games —pallankuzhi, paramapadham, tug of war,saguni attam. A 10x10 feet flex paramapadam place on the floor where participants could step on each block and make their moves was the highlight of the games section.Stilt walkers enthralled the participants with their ‘balanced’ performance. The cultural programme in the evening had V.N Daya, deputy general manager of Indian Bank, Chennai and Bhooma Venkatakrishnan as the chief guests. Bharatanatyam performance by Amirtha Natyalaya, jugalbandhi by Sthri Tharangam, pinnal kolattam dance by Pavai Kuzhuvinar, veena recital by Yashinee, and classical singing by Govind Kripa enthralled the audience.Thiruvallikeni Thiruvizha is the culmination of month-long efforts of the founders backed by a team of motivated and dedicated volunteers of Shree Utsav, Soundarya Ratnamala Group and residents and well-wishers."

Baapu”, a sensitive play directed by Bhanu Bharti, captures Mahatma Gandhi’s principled opposition to the proposal of the Partition of the country
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Bharatendu Natya Utsav, organised annually by Sahitya Kala Parishad, Government of Delhi, has acquired a significant place in the theatre world of the Capital in which the best productions of the year are featured. This year’s Utsav opened with the specially invited production of “Baapu” which was staged by Aaj Rangmandal at the Kamani Auditorium as a part of the celebration of the 150 birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.Written by renowned Hindi playwright Prof. Nand Kishore Acharya, recipient of Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Baapu unfolds like a long lyrical poem evoking intensely melancholic mood, replete with tragic musings. It reveals multiple layers of the wounded soul of Mahatma Gandhi towards the close of his life who is bitter by the betrayal of his followers in his quest for the creation of a spiritually powerful Indian society, strong enough to be the true practitioners of Satya and Ahimsa. The focal point of the play is the troubled inner world of Gandhi and out of which emerges the dichotomy between the great ideals of non-violence once followed by his followers with sincerity and their present opportunism for the lust after political power. The synthesis of expressive theatrical elements into artistic whole stirs the soul of the audience.Nehruvian philosophyThe directorThe play is directed by Bhanu Bharti, one of the pioneers of contemporary Indian theatre, who has several landmark productions of different genres to his credit . His philosophical vision is influenced by the Nehruvian era and his artistic credo is inspired by Gavari, a community theatre form of Bhils of Udaipur, Rajasthan and the Japanese classical theatre Noh and Kabuki.Over the years, he has evolved his own form to reflect deep antagonism in contemporary Indian society. In the production, what one discerns is his insight into what lies beneath the surface and to interpret the historical context in which Gandhi stands alone while the country is passing through turmoil and witnessing communal carnage. He undertakes fast for communal harmony and for ensuring safety for Muslims.Recalling BoseSolo in structure, the play is replete with historical references. In the play, the character of Gandhi refers again and again to Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose, the Muslim League and Mountbatten. The core of the production is Gandhi's principled opposition to the proposal of the Partition of the country. He is vehemently opposed to the proposals of the Cabinet Mission. He is sad that Nehru, Patel and Azad are following the plan of the Partition conceived on the basis of communalism. He feels that the top Congress leadership is close to Mountbatten while keeping him in the dark about the Partition. At several places, he declares that the country will only be divided on his dead body. He believes that the Congress leadership should be handed over to the younger generation and suggests the name of Narendra Dev but to his utter dismay his proposal is rejected outright.At the hour of his utter alienation, he recalls Subhas Chandra Bose whose candidature for the Congress President he had opposed tooth and nail. He says Subhas's men of Azad Hind Fauj came to his help to bring about peace and stop communal carnage. He recalls with pain that those whom he once considered his followers in the quest for truth and non-violence have done little to stop communal riots and instead they move out in police protection. Had they been Satyagarhi, they would have died in the cause of communal harmony and non-violence. He realises that his firm belief in non-violence, truth and call for communal harmony will enrage a section of Hindus and is obsessed with fanaticism as they are. They will kill him and this will be the death of a Satyagarhi who embraces death for the cause of Ahimsa and Satya.The play opens in a room with scanty objects-a bed, a small stool, a candle and at some distance a chair and charkha are kept. The emptiness of the space indicates solitude in which the protagonist has confined himself. Gandhi is alone, talking to himself. In the second half there is no bed, Gandhi sits on the floor. His alienation from the top leadership of the Congress has acquired an ominous air. Towards the end, we hear three gun shots and ‘Hey Ram’. The lights fade out.Realistic styleLighting by seasoned lighting designer R.K. Dhingra is highly ingenious. To create the right ambience, he has mostly used mood lighting and haze machine. Through lighting design, a black curtain is projected upstage, displaying a window on the wall. Only the movements of the performer are provided with a light that makes them clearly visible and most of the space is dimly lighted to reinforce the gloomy mood to reflect the isolation of a life inspired by great ideals.Teekam Joshi, a graduate from National School of Drama and one of the outstanding stage actors, is superbly cast in the role of Gandhi. He acts in a realistic style with restraint, imparting tremendous emotional tension to the portrait, revealing the inner turmoil of his character and truly living his life – indeed a memorable performance."

In the four seasons before De Gea signed, Alex Ferguson's side reached three Champions League finals. In the seven seasons since, United have made the quarter-finals just once and look likely to fall short of the last eight once more.Thibaut Courtois's arrival at Real appears to have closed the door to a move to Madrid.However, PSG and Italian champions Juventus are reportedly interested and could offer De Gea the guarantee of Champions League football – while United battle just to make the Premier League's top four once more – as well as a better chance to compete in the latter stages unless big changes are made at Old Trafford.Solskjaer hailed De Gea as “the best goalkeeper in the world” this week as he pleaded with him to commit his future to the club.The Norwegian has lifted the mood of players, staff and fans with is affable nature off the field and much improved results on it, making him the front runner for the manager's job on a full-time basis.

Taking a stand for constitutional freedoms,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/taking-a-stand-for-constitutional-freedoms/article26476006.ece,"
Third edition of Mumbai Collective to feature sessions on Rafale deal, distortion of history and rise of the surveillance state
",,"In late 2015, a group of ‘concerned citizens’ began discussing what they saw as a drift in public discourse under a Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government, and a set of alarming events, most notably killings related to cow slaughter, the murders of the rationalists Govind Pansare and M.M. Kalburgi, and a number of eminent people returning government awards as a form of protest.“Freedoms that we used to enjoy as part of the Constitution of India were under threat,” says R. Ramakumar, who teaches economics at the Centre for Study of Developing Economies, School of Development Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “We felt that the idea of freedom was being trampled; the freedom to dissent, the freedom to do what you want to do in many spheres, was shrinking around us.”A ‘pol’ fest, not a lit festThe group — academics, students, some journalists — felt that Mumbai had no platform or rallying point for people who shared these concerns. So, they decided to build one. It does not have a formal structure, just a name: the Mumbai Collective; Prof. Ramakumar is convenor and its public face.“We wanted a mass collective,” he says, “and different kinds of protests, not just speeches, talks, but also cultural forms of resistance: songs, poetry, paintings, photographs. We wanted our festival to be more a ‘pol’ fest than a lit fest.”The platform took shape in 2016, its first edition a two-day event, entirely volunteer-run with crowd-sourced funds. Though uncertain of response, they booked Y. B. Chavan Centre, which seats around 600. More than 1,500 people attended sessions over two days. “We were overwhelmed,” Prof. Ramakumar says. “People who were part of some kind of movement — progressive, secular — they probably last met when the Babri Masjid came down and riots took place in Mumbai.” This encouraged the collective to have a second edition in 2017, and after a hiatus in 2018, a third this Sunday.One difference from similar public talk fests is that this is not a place for different ideologies to be debated: that happens anyway in lit fests and every night on television. “It was not envisaged as something that would bring on stage people who have actually trampled dissent,” Prof. Ramakumar says. “We had our positions clear: we stand for constitutional freedoms; those who support that kind of idea of freedom will come on stage.”Room for differing viewsThis common minimum agenda — a commitment to secularism and constitutionally guaranteed rights and freedoms, and opposition to divisive ideologies — does not mean, Prof. Ramakumar clarifies, that there is no room for differing views, for instance, those of free market economists: “We don’t want to shut them out, because these are people who believe in a secular ideology.” The 2017 edition had a session on demonetisation, which both left- and right-leaning economists agreed was a bad idea, and Sunday will see discussion on the attacks on the RBI’s autonomy, and a session with P.C. Mohanan, who had resigned as acting head of the National Statistical Commission in protest against the non-release of the employment report of 2017-18. “He is making a public appearance for the first time. In your journalistic language, it will be a scoop!”Most sessions will be on more topical subjects: N. Ram on the Rafale deal, which he has reported extensively inThe Hindu[Mr. Ram is a former editor ofThe Hinduand Chairman, THG Publishing Pvt. Ltd., this newspaper’s publisher], retired Supreme Court judge Gopal Gowda on attacks on the judiciary, historian S. Irfan Habib on nationalistic distortions of history, advocate Sanjay Hegde on the rise of the surveillance state, Jagdeep Chokkar on electoral bonds and how the BJP is allegedly using them to subvert the Electoral Commission and the electoral process, and a discussion of the Supreme Court’s verdicts on Sabarimala and triple talaq. “There is a double-speak from the BJP,” Prof. Ramakumar says. “In the Sabarimala issue, it wanted a protection of traditions, but in the case of triple talaq, it found the interference of the SC in the traditions of a community very acceptable.”The event will also feature poetry with Javed Akhtar, music, and a photo exhibition on the agrarian crisis."

Confirming this, principal V.P.

He had taken a pacifist position and opposed those rooting for war with Pakistan. He had also shared a post which quoted the Pakistani Prime Minister on the destructive nature of war.Now, he has filed a complaint with the APMC police against the ABVP members. Superintendent of Police Prakash Nikam toldThe Hinduthat the complaint was filed on March 3 against some members of the ABVP. He said the police were verifying video footage to identify the accused, who will be charged with criminal trespass, wrongful confinement, and rioting, among other things.Legal opinionThe principal said, “The committee will conduct an investigation and submit a report in a few days. After that, we will seek legal opinion on action to be taken against the lecturer.” When reminded that M.B. Patil, Home Minister and chairman of the BLDE Association, which runs the college, had said that the lecturer had not uploaded anything anti-national, Dr. Huggi said they were only “discharging responsibilities” as authorities.Admitting that no person or organisation had filed a written complaint against the lecturer, he said that the college has decided to constitute the committee based on media reports. Dr. Huggi however made it clear that the college had not filed a case against the ABVP members who staged a dharna.Mr. Wathar said, “Since I have not committed any crime, I have no fear. I will say the truth,” he said."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Assembly Speaker Kodela Siva Prasada Rao has termed as immoral the entire episode of cases filed against the IT firm that is handling the TDP’s mobile App in Hyderabad, and observed that politics in the State has touched a new low.Addressing the media here on Tuesday, Dr. Siva Prasada Rao said it was unfortunate that the Telangana government had ordered a police inquiry based on a“frivolous complaint” by a YSRCP sympathiser.‘It belongs to TDP’“The data base belongs to the TDP and contains details of its members. How can the YSRCP file a complaint against the IT firm? I have been an MLA since 1983 and I have never seen politics stoop to such a low in my life,” the speaker said.Charging the YSR Congress Party with orchestrating the entire episode, Dr. Siva Prasada Rao said people should be a wary of such political parties that were bent on destroying institutions, engineering riots and abusing civil servants.“The YSRCP will reap the consequences of its actions as people are watching the developments closely. Commissioner of Police, Cyberabad, V.C. Sajjanar, is speaking like a politician. The State has seen unprecedented development since the year 2014, but this party (the YSRCP) is bent on destroying the image of the State,” Dr. Siva Prasada Rao said."

The unique pantheistic art form of the Theyyam faces increasing threats of gentrification and Brahminisation, thus paving the way for the destruction of the sacred groves where it was born
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"There’s a lake underneath the forest where a crocodile runs riot.Thus goes a myth about one of Kerala’s sacred groves, and it’s a myth that is firmly believed by the people who inhabit the area around the grove. And aspects of the myth colour the local Theyyam performed there.There has always been an unmistakable umbilical link between the dance form of Kerala called Theyyam and nature. A Theyyam is a ritualistic performance where pantheistic deities are summoned to the body of the performing man, one who is almost always from a subaltern community. Each of these instances of “possession” is rooted in a unique local myth, which in turn is rooted in the ancient sacred groves of Kerala calledkaavu. Eachkaavuis a small rainforest, and these were in abundance in the State until some years ago.In an extraordinary play between culture and nature, the grove nurtured the dance form and the dance form was instrumental in arresting the destruction of the groves even when development and modernity came knocking. Theyyam’s accoutrements have always been drawn from nature — such as garlands and decorations of ripe areca nuts, flowers, leaves and fruits — just as the biodiversity-rich wilderness of the groves has been the home of the pantheistic deities that thrived in the Malabar region.Spirit-worship, ancestor-worship, tree-worship, animal worship, serpent-worship, the worship of the goddesses of disease and the worship of theGraamadevataor village god, all are part of the Theyyam cult, which is a folk religion for millions. The number of major deities surviving now is about 100, while the number of Theyyams is more than 400.The ritualistic art form is ancient, predating organised Hinduism and harking back to a time of tribal animism. Over the years, Hindu elements have been slowly taken in and adapted to the ritual. This might well have enriched it but might also spell the death knell for a certain vital attribute of the Theyyam.Complete faithIt was always a symbiotic relationship. The deities — goddesses in most part and hereditarily embodied by designated men from specific communities — towered over a feudal society with its undivided landholdings. The land and the dance and the myths nurtured each other. The people of the region had complete and sanguine faith in the god or goddess who presided over the region, and the sacredness attached to the deity was extended to the grove, thereby giving it a protective cover.The hereditary nature of the Theyyam has meant that each custom and traditional practice is carefully protected, fostered and handed over. At a recent performance, for instance, of the Karimchamundi Theyyam at the Tharanthatta Karimchamundi shrine in north Malabar, Naranthan, a veteran performer, spoke appreciatively of how the younger generations after him even today reverently observe every custom before transforming into the theyyam.My village in north Malabar has akaavu. The presiding theyyams — Kadayankathi and Pethalan — inhabit the perennial darkness of the dense woods, entertaining a particular fondness for the mysterious hours of dusk or high noon. None dared disturb the sacred groves at these times, unless it was to request an exorcism.The aloof magnificence of Kadayankathi and Pethalan obscured their myths and origin stories, but the devout knew they had unmediated access to these deities when they manifested as theyyams during the days of the ritual.Missing the woodsOn a recent trip to thekaavuto pay respects to the theyyam during their annual visit, I was dismayed to find that the surrounding forest had all but disappeared. When I commented on this, a neighbour remarked, completely missing the irony, that the theyyam would have more room to perform if the forest was cleared further.When the Theyyam was a sacred ritual, its performance was in the nature of an offering to the deity. And the forest, the deity’s domain, was the performance space. Slowly, over the years, as the Theyyam has increasingly been marketed as a tourist attraction, it has become less ritual and more entertainment. This has meant that the dance aspect of it has taken precedence over the space and indeed over the sacred itself. And the recognition of Theyyam’s deeply symbolic character has begun to give way to an understanding of it merely as an art form. This, in turn, has impacted the sanctity of the forests orkaavu, and they are cut down carelessly.Besidesthe ecological consequence of such a development, a second threat looms large over the pantheistic origins and identity of Theyyam. A gradual Brahminisation has uprooted the primal spirits from the rock and the wood of the sacred groves they used to inhabit. Unlike Brahminical temples, thekaavufeatures no priestly rituals or lighting of lamps during non-Theyyam times. And the rituals are performed by the people themselves, not by priests. Thus, the sacred grove remains closed for most of the year, which allows the wilderness to grow back. The theyyams, however, are now lodged in brick-and-mortar temple structures outside the sacred grove — and worshipped through rituals unfamiliar to the elemental deities, and their favour is mediated by the priestly classes. The evicted theyyam takes with it the sacral protection extended to the grove.From grove to templeA grove located in Kasargod district in North Kerala — the Periya Bhagavathikaavu— illustrates the changes occurring in and around all of Kerala’s sacred groves. Kaliyattam (one of many kinds of ritual Theyyam) had ceased for several years at this grove, which was situated on a property owned for generations by a feudal lord. At the insistence of the villagers, the ritual was revived. The villagers consulted an astrologer for advice on the rituals to be followed. The astrologer divined that the gods and goddesses were cramped inside the confines of the sacred grove. The only solution was their re-consecration in a temple complex outside the grove. A priest was given the charge of invoking the favour of the gods and the village celebrated the consecration with an annual Kaliyattam.And thus thekaavufaded from the Periya Bhagavathikaavu, and it is certain to become the Periya Bhagavathi ‘temple’ in no time. This story is not restricted to Periya Bhagavathi, but has recurred across sacred groves all over North Kerala. You have to look no further than Nandapuram Sreekrishna Temple, where the Vishnumoorthi Theyyam and the Gulikan Theyyam hold annual performances. Unsurprisingly, a recent consultation with the astrologer again revealed that the Theyyam ritual itself ought to be replaced with more conventional Brahminical temple rituals to obtain divine favours. Like thekaavu, will the ritual performance too fade or morph into something else? Only time will tell.Meanwhile, the theyyam that has for so long watched over the land and its denizens must come to its own rescue. The Brahminisation and the loss of the sacred grove have not escaped the notice of the theyyam, I observed. During a recent performance, the Kadayankathi bellowed at the village elders: ‘Where have my groves gone?’ The answer perhaps lies in a question the Pethalan posed during the performance to his gentrified cousin, Palenthayi Kannan (originating from a local myth, but whose identity is now subsumed by the Narasimha avatar of Vishnu). “Did you christen me Kaatumoorthi (primitive forest deity) because you found the name Pethalan uncouth?” he asked.(The photos featured here are part of a project called Lost Wilderness that won the India Habitat Centre Photosphere Award last year.A selection is on display atIndia Habitat Centre,New Delhi,till March 18.)Being godTraditionally, clans set up shrines in akaavuon their land, where the Theyyam deity would appear once a year or even once in12 yearsThe practice goes back to the agrarian society of a time when clan heads held much of the land aroundThe performers belong to subaltern communities like Vannan, Velan, Malayan, etc.The rituals are different from Brahminical ones, often involving blood sacrifices or walking on embersIt’s an open-air performance in front of the forest shrine that can go on for hoursThe costumes and face-painting are extraordinarily elaborate, and art forms in themselves. The extravagant headgear called mudi can even be 50-60 ft highMusical instruments include chenda, tudi, kuzhal, ilathalam and veekniAs the dancers spin and twirl to the frantic drums, they enter a state of trance before collapsing. It takes a while for them to revive, after which devotees seek their blessingsWhen the Theyyam was a sacred ritual, its performance was in the nature of an offering to the deity. And the forest, the deity’s domain, was the performance spaceTheyyam is ancient, predating organised Hinduism and harking back to a time of tribal animism.

First of all sleep itself was destroyed by Mrs. Mathrubootham. She said, “Old man, I think gas cylinder is finished can you please urgently go and get a new cylinder.”I said, “Kamalam when retired person is waking up, will you please give two minutes of time to slowly start brain and heart and liver and all before shouting? Even now my heart is beating badabadabadabadabada so much that A.R. Rahman will put it in a song.” She said, “Old man instead of giving speech you please understand,dosa maavuis sitting in the kitchen andpulippuis increasing like anything. If you don’t get cylinder immediately means breakfast is banana.”I said, “Kamalam, whether any large plate is there in the kitchen? Please put it on dining table.” She said, “Why?” I said, “I can then put my head on the plate and you can eat it peacefully.” “Ha ha ha ha,” she laughed heartily, then came back withdosa maavubowl and said, “Super comedy, old man, one way or the other you have to eat thismaavu, your choice if you want it cooked or raw.”So instead of my usual relaxed routine at 8:15 in the morning, I had to put on shirt-pant and all and go downstairs to find auto and then go to gas cylinder depot. Downstairs, I saw Dr. Shankaramenon. He said, “Mathrubootham, what a pleasant surprise you are outside very early today.” I said, “Gas cylinder emergency doctor, what to do?”He said, “Did you have tea or anything? If not let us do one quick roadside tea and then you can get gas cylinder.”I said, “OK why not.” We had tea. Then I went to look for auto. While I was waving hand for auto here and there like Kamal Haasan inNizhal Nijamaagiradhudance scene, suddenly Mohammed Usman voice came from the sky: “Mathrubootham? Mathrubootham! Hello Mathru?”Ten minutes later we were sitting and eating tiffin in nearby hotel. Somehow I told Usman, “Please let me go, gas cylinder emergency is there.” So he said, “Ok, Ok, you go.” Then I finally found one auto and we went towards depot. In between auto fellow said, “Sir can we go to pump please, it will take only 10 minutes.” I said, “Oh my god, my son has same problem at home also, please finish urgently.”While he was putting diesel in the pump I went to nearby shop and purchased one newspaper and two three magazines. Finally, we reached gas cylinder depot at 9:30 am. I said, “One gas cylinder.” He said, “Uncle please pay the money.” I said, “Please take my debit card.”Madam/ Sir tragedy of tragedies. Where is my debit card? Not this pocket. Not that pocket. Not back pocket. Not wallet. Not shirt pocket. Nowhere debit card. I said, “Oh my god, can you give gas cylinder, I will get money and come immediately?”He said, “Uncle you are superb, but money is money what to do. You please take your time and come back with money, I will keep cylinder on one side for you.”Madam/ Sir, next 30 minutes mother of all panics. I thought, oh my god, how I will show my face to Mrs. Mathrubootham? No cylinder and no debit card also.After two to three minutes high tension I thought Mathrubootham, what nonsense, you can manage.I came home and said, “Kamalam, you will not believe what happened today. I went directly to the depot and full riot type situation is happening there. Customers fighting and fighting. I spent one hour trying to get gas cylinder, but depot fellow said uncle you go home. Better come back later. This scene below your status. What to do Kamalam, what to do. Should I sacrifice status? Never. I will go back later.”“Okay,” she said. “Also, Mr. Usman came half hour back and gave me your debit card. You dropped it in hotel after tiffin. Anyway I have arranged for cylinder for time being from Dr. Shankaramenon, he said he has extra. How was your tea?”I could not give any answer because by this time I had already run out of the house at full speed and escaped.Yours in exasperation,J. Mathrubootham"

No evidence for these sections in footage, say police ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Rabale police have dropped some of the charges, including attempt to murder and molestation, from the case after going through footage of the fisticuffs between the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena workers on Friday.The police have dropped Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC from the complaint made by NCP workers. From Sena’s complaint, Section 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) has been dropped.Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I, Sudhakar Pathare, said, “When we scrutinised the videos, we did not find any evidence supporting the claims made by the complainants. The sections of rioting, assault and gathering crowd still remain in both cases. We have submitted a report to the court on why those sections are not relevant in the case.”Mr. Pathare said as per Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in case of cognisable offences, police officers have to write down the complaint as mentioned by the complainant. “In the further course of investigations, the investigating officer has the right to add or drop sections as per the findings. For a charge like attempt to murder, a motive has to be there. A person who has welcomed another by bursting fire crackers a few minutes prior won’t be attempting murder. Even in case of outraging the modesty, nowhere in the videos did we see any such act,” Mr Pathare said.In the cross complaints filed by the two parties, Airoli corporator M.K. Madhvi of the Sena and other party workers were accused of attempting to murder and deterring NCP MLA Sandeep Naik’s bodyguard from discharging his duty, while Mr. Naik and NCP Mayor Jaywant Sutar were accused of outraging the modesty of Mr. Madhvi’s wife.“The Madhvi family is absconding and hence have not been arrested,” Mr. Pathare said. The Rabale police have arrested seven NCP workers and six Sena workers. All 13 were produced in court and have been granted bail, senior police inspector Sanjay Godse said."

The strangest wars in history,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/the-strangest-wars-in-history/article26434172.ece,"
Wars, unless fought for ideals such as freedom, liberty and justice, are usually a waste of valuable resources and time. In modern times, we have seen battles being fought for essentials such as water. And then, there are battles that have been fought for the strangest of reasons - such as the ones listed here. Let’s see what they were fought for.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Battle of the IceHazard a guess: was this battle fought over ice cubes? Did two countries fight to conquer an icy region? Or did they use ice to fight it?The Battle of Ice is named thus because it was fought on a frozen lake. Lake Peipus, which lies between Russia and Estonia, was picked as the battleground for a fight that was religious in nature. The Teutonic Knights, a Catholic group, invaded Russia to convert Orthodox Christians. Approximately 10,000 to 12,000 knights were warring on the icy lake. The Knights were kept at bay by the Russians, led by Alexander Nevsky. Folklore associated with this battle suggests that several knights, during battle, had been pushed to the western shores of the lake where the ice was thin. Several knights are said to have been dragged to the bottom of the freezing lake, thanks to the heavy armour they wore.Russia still adheres to Orthodox Christianity while Estonia remains Catholic and Protestant in its religious leanings. A futile battle, indeed!The Pastry WarThe Mexican War of Independence liberated Mexico from Spain’s dominion in 1821. For several years after that, the tension between the government and the rebels led to ugly street fights, rioting, ransacking and looting on the streets of Mexico. Plenty of shops and businesses were reduced to rubble. One such shop was a bakery that belonged to Monsieur Remontel, a Frenchman. Remontel demanded an astronomical 60,000 pesos as compensation for his bakery. Because Mexico refused to even acknowledge his complaint, Remontel chose to approach the French King Louis-Phillipe directly. The French, already fed up of trying to get Mexico to pay its mounting debts, demanded 6,00,000 pesos as compensation and a separate payment of 60,000 pesos for Remontel’s bakery. Incidentally, the bakery had been valued at less than 1,000 pesos. Mexico, as usual, ignored the missive. France then blocked-off sea trade with Mexico. Angered by this move, Mexico declared war against France and The Pastry War began. It lasted four months. Britain secured peace between the two warring factions and ensured that Mexico paid the amount of 6,00,000 pesos to France and also compensated Remontel for his bakery.Wars might have been fought for several juvenile reasons, but this one sure takes the cake!The War of the Oaken BucketBloodshed was common in Europe during the medieval ages. It could have the silliest of triggers—such as the stealing of a wooden bucket.Italy, which was not a unified country in the medieval period, included groups that were at loggerheads because of their religious beliefs. One such group, the Ghibelline, believed that the King was the representative of God on Earth, and therefore, deserved to be worshipped. Another group, the Guelphs believed that the Pope had crowned the King, and was, therefore, above the King in hierarchy.Modena, a city in northern Italy, was Ghibelline and Bologna, a city 30 miles away, was Guelph. Once, soldiers from Modena sneaked into Bologna and disappeared with a wooden bucket full of loot. Bologna was enraged—not only had they been stolen from, their pride had been attacked.To recover their stolen riches and the bucket (and some amount of pride), Bologna declared war on Modena. It was not an equal war. Bologna’s army that was almost six times larger than Modena’s. Yet, within two hours, they were routed.A replica of the bucket hangs in Modena even today!The Pig WarIn the most benign of all the wars mentioned here, the only irrecoverable loss was the life of a pig.In 1859, the U.S. and Britain were fighting over borders. The San Juan islands were the particular bone of contention between the two. As it happened, a pig owned by British Hudson Bay company strayed into a potato farm owned by American farmer Lyman Cutlar and did the thing that pigs do - it ate and ate and ate. The farmer tried complaining to local authorities and when they took no action, he shot the pig. This single bullet brought the two countries to war. Almost.As it happened, neither side really wanted a war. It took several years, but they finally decided where they wanted to settle on the island as well. The British occupied the northern part of the island while the Americans settled in the southern part.If you think these wars were silly to the point of being hilarious, maybe the next time you are fighting with your friend or sibling about erasers, sharpeners, socks and such, you might want to pause and think. Are you unknowingly triggering the War of Wet Socks?"

Tune in tothe twitter ofwinged visitorsin your neighbourhood
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is the time of the year when Nature is at her vibrant best and one cannot miss the vibrant hues all around as well as the fragrance of fruits and flowers in the neighbourhood. More than the riot of colours, there is one other element that would catch your attention, especially during the early hours of the day – the chirping and tweeting of birds that are out in search of the proverbial early worm. What is more important is — you don’t have to go far and wide to spot them – you can find a good majority of them in your own backyard!One of the nostalgic memories that most of us carry from our childhood days is that of listening to the song of the Asian koel. It is usually delivered as a duet. With the advent of the mating season (March-August) you cannot miss them — the male which almost resembles a crow, except for the pale green / grey beak and dark red eyes and the female aptly called as ‘pullikkuyil’ in Malayalam thanks to its beautifully speckled body. While the mating call is a musical sound, koels have a large repository of sounds, ranging from shrill angry tones to alarmed tones, which they make at the sight of crows or other threats.Musical tonesWhen you speak of musical tones, the name that first comes to the mind is the bulbul. While you may find the red vented bulbuls occasionally, it is the Red-whiskered bulbul that is sighted more often in the urban areas. The tall pointed black crest, red face patch and thin black moustachial line give it an elegant look and you can find them in lightly wooded areas, bushes and shrubs. They are often found feeding on fruits and small insects.Rufous treepie is another common resident found in our backyard. They add a dash of colour with their cinnamon-coloured body and the white patch across the feathers as well as wings.If you have flowers around your home, especially shoe flower, you would be hearing the unmistakable twitter of sunbirds. Purple-rumped sunbirds are small, colourful birds that are less than 10 cm in size and as typical of most of the birds, the male of the species is more beautiful with its green metallic crown and shoulder patch. You will often see them hanging on branches and pecking at the base of large shoe flowers. Two other smaller species that you can find in your neighbourhood are the common tailor bird and the Pale-billed flowerpecker. Tailor birds are famous for their nests made by ‘sewing’ leaves together.It is time to look out for two of the noisy, yet colourful species of birds — Rose-ringed parakeet and the lesser Goldenback- or Black- rumped flameback woodpecker. Rose-ringed parakeet gets its name from the black and rose ring that the male bird has and you will find them nibbling away at ripe guavas, mangoes and other fruits as well as grains like paddy. Black-rumped flameback is the most commonly found woodpecker in urban areas and announces its presence with loud, shrieking calls. While the male bird has a red crown and crest, the female has a black forecrown with red only on the rear part of the crest.When you talk about noise and chatter, you cannot avoid the most common of all species — the crows and the mynahs. Crows are territorial as well as fearless — quite often you will see them chasing black kites, which are almost three times their size and successfully guarding their turf. Mynahs on the other hand are boisterous with a wide range of sounds in their repertoire. Sometimes you will also find Jungle mynahs, characterised by the tuft of hairs on the forehead, in wooded areas and open agricultural lands next to urban areas.If you happen to see a flash of blue followed by a loud, whirring call, you have located the White-throated kingfisher in the locality. One of the least shy species, they are often found in the open. The Greater Coucal or crow pheasant is a large bird which is shy and darts for cover at the sight of humans.As the sun makes it way to call it a day, you would see the black drongos and bee-eaters get into the thick of action. One peculiar habit of both these species is the way they perch – they would be on the branch of a tree and then suddenly, you will see a quick take off and a blur as the bird makes a sortie in the air and deftly catches the moth / butterfly or bee and then returns back to the same branch where they were sitting earlier – like a bomber returning to its base after a successful mission.Another resident is the White-cheeked barbet — a very common presence in our neighbourhood. It may not be easy to spot them as they blend seamlessly with the greenery around – but the loud, monotonous call will help you zero in on the target.Depending on the place you stay, you are likely to see black and Brahminy kites, magpie robins, pond herons, owls, doves and pigeons – the list goes on. Next time when you hear that chirp or twitter, take a good look, say ‘Hi’ to your avian neighbours and experience the joy of watching them in action!The author is a faculty member at Asian School of Business, Trivandrum.Depending on the place you stay, you are likely to see black and Brahminy kites, magpie robins, pond herons, owls, doves and pigeonsTips and TricksWhile bird watching is a satisfying passion, it is also something that you can get started easily – all you need is a bit of spare time, a good pair of eyes and ears and good weather! If you are a first-timer, here are a few tips that can help you:Start early – while any time is a good time for birding, you are likely to find maximum birds early in the morning.It would be good to have a pair of binoculars to help in identifying the birds and observing them without intruding into their space.Carry a notebook and pen / pencil and start recording the details – date, place, time, species found, any interesting observations (carrying nesting materials / feeding on fruit / type of call made...)Sometimes, you may not know the name of the species and it would be useful to note down the colour of the plumage, size, shape of beak and so on. When it is comes to noting down the size, you could use known birds as a reference. If possible, make a short sketch of the bird in your notebook.A field guide or mobile app is another useful aid in identifying the species. Salim Ali’sThe Book of Indian Birdsmay be quite handy for beginners.Blend into the surroundings by wearing dull-coloured clothing – shades of green or light brown are the best and avoid bright colours at any cost. Remember to keep quiet.If you happen to find a nest, avoid touching the eggs or the young chicks – there is a high chance of them being abandoned by the parents if you do so.Finally, bird watching is all about patience. The more patient you are, the greater are the chances of an amazing experience.Depending on the place you stay, you are likely to see black and Brahminy kites, magpie robins, pond herons, owls, doves and pigeonsFlocking togetherVedanthangal in Tamil Nadu is the oldest water bird sanctuary in the country. More than 40,000 birds from various parts of the world visit the sanctuary during the migratory season"

"Templated sound, disappointing vocals",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/templated-sound-disappointing-vocals/article26412125.ece,"
Uncharacteristically middling fare is the downfall of Sonchiriya’s soundtrack, says Vipin Nair ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With the exception of his last film – the crime drama from 2016,Udta Punjab– director Abhishek Chaubey has always handed the composing duties for his films to Vishal Bhardwaj. InSonchiriya, the pair reunites, though without lyricist Gulzar – Chaubey retains Varun Grover from hisUdta Punjabcrew for this one. Last year, was kind of a mixed bag for Bhardwaj, with a few memorable songs among the two movies he did, but also a bunch of mediocre ones. Let’s see if he’s bounced back withSonchiriya.Monotonous vocalsA Twitter friend made an observation last week (before the release of Sonchiriya’s music) about the pattern that Vishal’s soundtracks have fallen into of late – in terms of the choice of genres and singers – which has made the prospect of a new album from the veteran less exciting of late. It’s unfortunate, thatSonchiriya’s soundtrack pretty much sticks to Vishal template for most part. The song where that monotony has the most detrimental effect is the folksy dance track sung by Sukhwinder Singh and Rekha Bhardwaj, ‘Naina Na Maar’. While Singh’s singing reminds of you of the multiple similar numbers that he’s rendered, even Rekha sounds out of sorts, and not just in this song. Singh’s other song is a better affair – ‘Saanp Khavega’ has great potential, marked by powerful lines from Grover, and a momentous, almost eerie orchestration (Budapest Film Orchestra at work). But sadly, the end product falls short of anything worth writing home about.‘Ruan Ruan’ checks the “pensive melody” box, formerly handled by the composer himself but taken over by Arijit Singh in recent soundtracks. This is however a case where the quality of the song lifts it above the déjà vu aspect, to make it a winner. Arijit is in good form, delivering Grover’s neatly written verse, but it is the arrangement – the guitars (Ankur Mukherjee, Dhruv Visvanath and bassist Saurabh Suman) interspersed with that whistle hook shadowing the ‘Ruan Ruan’ refrain – that really drew me to the song.Unrealised potentialAnother number that had the making of a terrific piece, but doesn’t quite get there is the title song. The composition is something of a surprise to begin with – a gentle, lullaby-ish cadence at complete odds with the fierceness that dominated the film’s promos. The interlude features a lovely classical-flavoured solo on the guitar (played almost like a slide guitar) by Chintoo Singh. It’s the vocals that let the song down – Rekha sounds better here than she did in ‘Naina’, but is still nowhere close to her best.The Budapest Film Orchestra joins in the party in the song’s reprise version and the backdrop gets more elaborate. The singing though, disappoints yet again, but I will take this version for the sweeping instrumental passages by the orchestra. This version of the song occasionally takes me back to the composer’s brilliant ‘Shaaradendu’ that he composed for the Malayalam movieDaya(1998).‘Baaghi Re’ is the track that actually feels like the film’s theme song. The rock-flavoured arrangement follows along the lines of other songs in the genre, that Vishal has created in the past, except with a touch of the Wild West in keeping with the film’s Chambal settings. The decision to hand vocal duties to the folk powerhouse Mame Khan helps escape the tedium to an extent, as he brings in his brand of improvisations to the rendition. The song has another version, and given the current trend, it’s a welcome change to have the remix in the same album. The Groove Room Producers’ spruced-up arrangement, is nicely done, though I prefer the touch of hinterland in the original.Sonchiriya’s album is uncharacteristically middling fare from Vishal, that feels particularly ordinary coming on the back of two recent soundtracks –Gully Boyin Hindi andKumbalangi Nightsin Malayalam, both of which are exceptional."

When I got a call from Jeethu (Joseph) sir for a narration I was expecting a thriller or an action movie. I heard the story and was surprised because from start to end it was a laugh riot. My character is very different from Gauthaman ofPoomaram, the mood of the film is different. I was very relaxed during filming, I just went with the flow. It was a good team, which made work easy.

The tree branch he’s hanging on turns out to be a snake and he knows he’s going to die. But what if there’s a honeycomb, with drops of honey about to fall tantalisingly?As absurd as the imagery presented by the narration is, Sethupathi’s voice draws you in and makes you believe in the allegorical story.But what is the story anyway? The trailer tells you next to nothing, except that Sethupathi carries off a saree like he’s worn one all his life.The two-minute trailer is cut and edited in such a way that all you get are flashes and impressions of people. Sethupathi’s broad shoulders during the opening and the man who looks his character up and down; Samantha Akkineni with a knife; Fahadh Faasil hitting his head in utter despair; three young boys getting up to mischief; Ramya Krishnan sensuously flipping her hair and more.The trailer is also a riot of colours — blue window frames, yellow walls and sunlight pouring in through many of the shots.If this is just the trailer, then we can’t wait for the actual film!Super Deluxeis scheduled for release on March 29.

Islamabad’s counsel in Jadhav case seeks dismissal of India’s claim for relief
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Pakistan’s counsel Khawar Qureshi and Attorney-General Anwar Mansoor Khan concluded the Kulbhushan Jadhav hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Thursday, by calling for India’s claim for relief to be dismissed or declared inadmissible, on the basis of the appeal options being available to him in Pakistan. The two cited an FIR that had been filed at a civilian court in Pakistan.“India seeks relief which they cannot receive from the court,” insisted Mr. Khan.Also ReadKulbhushan Jadhav ICJ hearing | Live updates: Jadhav tried under espionage law in military court, says PakistanThe legal team also launched a wider attack on India, invoking the Kathua rape case, the Samjhauta Express bombing, the Gujarat riots and the use of pellet guns in Kashmir as instances of failures of India’s judicial system and human rights record. Mr. Qureshi began with a personal attack on India and a number of its senior figures, including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and India’s counsel Harish Salve, accusing New Delhi of inhabiting a “wonderland” in “desperation and total disregard for the truth”.Revision system“Pakistan has a very robust revision and reconsideration system,” Mr. Khan told the court. In Pakistan — as is the case in other countries — military court proceedings are sometimes subject to state security considerations and therefore secrecy is maintained, he said.“We want cooperation with India, we want peaceful coexistence with India but that will not [happen] until India stops sending serving officers across the border for espionage and sabotage,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said following the hearing.“India’s position is that of wonderland. Indeed it is of a rotund character with a fragile cranium. Pakistan is not the one who brought him into this court,” Mr. Qureshi said, in an apparent reference to Mr. Salve, who had on Wednesday slammed the language and tone of Mr. Qureshi’s opening arguments.Judgments by the ICJ are made on an average within six months of the hearings concluding, though this can vary from a shorter period to a couple of years.Decision is bindingThe decision of the court is binding, and non-appealable, though it is possible to make a request for interpretation if there is a dispute between the two sides as to what the judgment means or what its scope is.There is also a possibility to request a review of the judgment if a “matter comes to light” that the court was previously unaware of and which could be a “decisive factor”.While requests for interpretation have on occasion been accepted, no requests for review have been successful to date."

Beyond bread and butter,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/beyond-bread-and-butter/article26352315.ece,"
An account of a time of throbbing pain and acute realisation of what’s going on around you
",,"My father always said dogs can perceive omens. It was incredible as a child for me to believe this, whenever I would offer a dog a biscuit or a chapati, and it would devour it greedily and would later rub itself against my leg and lick my feet. It was unusual to imagine that abilities of such mythic proportions would be at the disposal of an order of creatures we consider incapable of freedom from instincts. As it turns out, their instincts would often lead them to bark at certain shifty individuals. They would certainly bark at the other people in my chawl, especially outsiders — save Chacha.Chacha has been delivering pao bread, butter, eggs, lozenges and other confectionery items in our chawl for as long as I remember. I remember seeing him standing at the threshold, holding his old white cement sack, that still somehow faintly bore the name of the company, while my father would answer him and take our usual share of one packet of pao and four eggs for one day. I remember seeing him with his thick black beard as a child and remembering the tale of the Kabuliwala, except that Chacha was a frail looking man all along but had a certain vitality and energy to him that my puny comprehension could never locate. He cycled to our chawl each day. When it rained, which was almost as certain as Chacha’s punctuality, we could see him in his yellow tarpaulin raincoat with the goods covered with a white plastic sheet. Even the rainbow-coloured fan that whirled around did not move then as the contradictory winds and the downpour just made it confused and cease all motion.Time passed and I began answering the door, the number of paos doubled while two more eggs added to our share. Chacha occasionally brought along his son to familiarise him with us and the nearbytenements, so that he could soon replace him. Chacha was getting old. He already had lost most of his teeth to his habit of tobacco, and I could see a discernible limp in his gait and a hunch in his posture, which made the sparsity on his dome all the more conspicuous. His beard was losing its jet, and was streaked with strands of inevitable grey.I remember his son as a likeable kid, but I only ever saw him as a young urchin with the same brilliance in his eyes as Chacha, confident, and probably ambitious, often carrying a toy aeroplane with him. He was well-mannered too, for when my father gifted him some money or some of my old clothes at Diwali or Holi, he would thank him and touch his feet — an honorable gesture.Perennially, when I took the parcel of eggs from him, the wrapping paper bore an article from the pen of Dada Rao. I am almost certain that Chacha was older than Dada Rao. Dada Rao has been a timeless icon of our people’s strength and resilience against foreigners and aliens. My childhood was replete with patrikas and pamphlets of Dada Rao, commanding his followers to rally with him in his battles against injustice and exterior attempts at subordination. Dada Rao was a superhero to me in my youth. There were comics of his exploits, where he would frequently cross the border to teach our wicked neighbours a lesson, and often he would beat and parade butchers and sweepers because they had slaughtered or consumed cow. Often these characters resembled Chacha in their appearance.My father once told me at breakfast that Chacha and his “ilk” were living here on our land. “His kind will be severely punished by Dada Rao. You just wait and see when he comes into power,” he muttered while he took a bite of a toasted pao. Mother was cooking eggs and the smell filled our small two-room apartment.“These people have grown too proud. What do you think? Huh?”“He is just a kid. Spare him your tea chatter. What then will you blabber on about with your friends if you blurt it all out at breakfast?” chuckled mother.“He is the future of our community. Don’t lecture me on how to raise my son,” retorted father as he sipped his tea. “Beta, you need to learn thisas soon as possible for your own good. These people are not your friends. They are only here to multiply, and make this land as our neighbouring country and several others only a few thousand miles away.” I was looking down at my plate, but father had not ended his expostulation.“See, these people are so proud and smug. Look at them! They serve us, live at our pleasure and have the audacity to smile at our faces and allow their kids to play with ours!”His speech had a marked acquaintance to my judgment. I believe I had seen it on TV in one of Dada Rao’s election rallies. I remember millions there, jumping up at his every word, clapping, shouting, jeering when he admonished the current government for the sorrowful conditions in which our community lives. I remember seeing women, old and young, clutching at their little babies or holding the hands of their children, crying and howling when Dada Rao declared that he will protect them against the lustful foreigners. These words and images were engraved on my impressionable mind, almost as if the very hammer and nail that were the insignia for Dada Rao’s party were the weapons that were used to do so.Time was a visitor as always, and Dada Rao’s party won with a remarkable majority. He nominated a respectable and rather agreeable looking fellow from his party as the Chief Minister. I can distinctly reminisce of those days. A band had paraded throughout the city with dhols and cymbals, drums and blaring speakers, announcing to every living soul and each of the dead that Dada Rao, their pious and just leader, was here finally — a second coming of a mythical deity as it were — to deliver his people from the clutches of slavery and ignominy.A local convoy of supporters had reached our chawl that day. I remember them on their loud Yamaha bikes with thumping engines, saffron bands on their heads, smearing saffron gulal on each other’s faces. The elders remained planted on the balconies and windows, smiling and cheering them on. The women clapped and beat their utensils. The dogs barked. All of my friends went out to join them in their celebration, and I did so too.We danced, we laughed and we shouted slogans. It was an initiation, an acceptance into a world I had admired from afar, and now I was submerged in it. The saffron consumed me, assimilating my existence into it, giving me an identity, an association, and in return, I gave it myself. I was not one now but many. We were together in our joy and in our quest for independence. I was saffron. The sheer bliss I felt made me forget that I was hungry. I could not have breakfast that day since Chacha had not come.We had to manage our supplies for the next couple of weeks, after which Chacha resumed his services. He was still his same sombre but lively self, but I often thought I noticed a dissimilarity between the Chacha of old and the one who came to our house now. I thought I saw a shame in his eyes, the dissident vitality of old replaced by a meek submissiveness. Often when he did not have change, he would say he will settle it the next day. However, now he would run around the building and bring the change back to us. There were other curious changes too. When I would answer the door having just prayed bearing a tika on my forehead, he would not look up. He would silently nod, hand me the paos and eggs and walk away, stuffing the money hastily and often carelessly into the pockets of his kurta, invariably spilling coins in the corridor and earning a curse or two from the residents.Soon Chacha stopped coming altogether and was replaced by his son, as he would have intended.His son had grown into a confident young man. He was sprightly, and the bounce in his step helped me envision a younger, chattier Chacha on the same bicycle — one that was unafraid just like his son. His garrulous charm had resisted the onslaught of adolescence and won over the people of the chawl, which he frequented in the evening when he played cricket with us. He was liked by the dogs too, and often let out a packet of biscuits and paos for them. He had told me his mother had passed away so Chacha looked after the shop. This was easier for his aging eyes too, while he was in charge of delivery and pickups. He had to give up his education because of it, but he said that he planned to continue it in a few years. The aeroplane was still on his mind.And so the needles of the clock went on until they were halted by another thud on my remembrance.It was a pleasant morning, the rising sun spilled the first of its already decaying orange light through the window in its absurd routine, while mother served me tea. December had set in and following a healthy monsoon, it was getting a little chilly. The mosque had fallen a few days ago, and riots had broken out all over the city. Our locality was largely untouched and the paos and eggs were coming regularly.Mother was preparing father’s lunch while he bathed. The smell of frying onions and their sibilance was interrupted by a ruckus outside. I heard distant drumming and frightening roars, a loudness matched only by the deafening detonation of bombs from old war documentaries. I was shaken out of my comfortable reverie and jumped to a window.I could see no one and dismissed it all as another one of the zealous celebrations of my fellows of their victory over history. The dogs barked ceaselessly as they always did when they drummed maniacally, but a shoo or a stick made the stupid beasts scamper away yelping in terror.I sat down to sip my tea when I heard a woman’s shriek, shrill almost like a girl’s, shriller than the clang of swords on shields, piercing my ears like a pacing javelin, hurting. I ran up to the window again and saw the horde of celebrators had reached the compound of the chawl. They were gathered round in a circle and shouting slogans while a few women stood a comfortable twenty or thirty yards away with an incriminating, almost baneful look on their face, holding a girl, sobbing and screaming. It was her voice that had made me jump up. She beat her head and her chest, her hair had been undone, the kohl from her eyes bled into her face, besmirching it with the harrowing semblance of an inevitability, a fear-driven humiliation that had sauntered on to her face which I had never seen before. She was the daughter of a resident.All this while the men’s faces ranged from apoplectic paralysis to haughty jeering and chuckling. They brandished wooden sticks, almost as thick as the boughs of the asoka. They shouted slogans of “justice” and “revenge”. Excited at this raucous commotion, I went down, leaving the tea to cool with the rising sun.By the time I got into the compound, the crowd had started moving. The girl let out another wail that left me shaken in my steps, but I walked on.I could see rags which were oddly familiar, red stains and some saffron gulal where the horde had stood. I ran up to join them, unmindful of the fact that I was now accompanying them in raising the same slogans. There were some of my friends at the back of the crowd, still too young for a voter identity card, but they goaded me on relentlessly. I followed the crowd to the exit gate of the chawl, where I was followed by the barking dogs, which looked on helplessly, mewling and shaking.I looked on, bemused and perplexed when it dawned on me. I stood there frozen, afraid, and disgusted. My mind was an infinitely contorted maze of ideas, and memories. I was too late.Cries of hapless anguish filled the silent winter air. The smoke rose into the heavens, not at all what his God had wanted. I had never known the smell of burning flesh, and now I wish that I could forget it. The crowd cheered on while he danced with fiery death and rolled on the wet road that gave him no aid. He rolled and rolled and rolled but to no avail. It went on for some time. I looked at it the whole time.He lay there, wriggling like a worm. It was soon over; petrol burns fast. His cries were gone. The smoke was gone. The winter morning consumed them, hid them from discovery, but failed in front of the charred mass.The crowd scattered, spitting and clapping, raising the same slogans they had raised all morning. The girl still cried. I returned to my home. Mother asked no questions, packed my father’s lunch who went out to the shop.The paos and eggs stopped coming. We welcomed the new year, and the riots continued for some more time.I have to go out in the evenings now to get the paos and eggs, and often I amble past Chacha’s shop but it remains shut. There are weeds growing around it, where people used to sit at tea and discuss politics, and cricket and Dada Rao while Chacha or his wife served them toasted paos and omelettes. It is funny how quickly weeds grow and occupy a place.The chawl has returned to its routine. My friends have got their voter identity cards now, and voted Dada Rao into power again. I have notseen the crying girl in months. It turned out that the family has shifted to a nearby town, citing dishonour. I began assisting my father at his shop, and now look forward to replacing him, especially after his bout of epilepsy.Since that day, I have had a troubled relationship with sleep. I lie down and my eyes do not shut all night. Even when they do, I hear screams. Ceaseless pouring out of lungs and voice for as long as one may be struck dumb, but they continue.Today, I was lying awake in my bed when the doorbell rang. I got up, slipped my feet into my shoes and walked to the door. I opened it to find an emaciated figure, oddly recognisable, bearded white with watery bronze eyes and a hollow mouth. I looked at him for what I perceived lasted an hour, while the chime of the doorbell and the devotional songs that rang with it reverberated in my head. My reverie was broken again.“Eggs, beta?” asked the man. I looked at him. He was robotic, almost inhuman except that his nostrils flared to allow breathing; nevertheless, when they failed, he opened his mouth and looked on. The only emotive response I could gather was one of a patient impatience, an ache to go somewhere, do something but a retirement to the actuality of everything.“No, uh,” I caught the hair at the back of my head with my right hand and squeezed them, “we have them.” I felt a pang of complex emotions, too tough for me to articulate and I realised that he had perceived that.He turned around, without as much as a twitch in his eyelid, and walked away. I walked into the corridor to chase after him, to talk to him, maybe shed sympathy but he walked on with his white sack, blending into the darkness of the corridor where the rising sun still did not shine.If I could, I would ask Dada Rao if it was worth it. Since the day he walked off into the corridor, I have stopped hearing screams. Even when I am able to catch a few hours’ sleep, I am haunted by a singular dream — the bicycle that lay by the blackened heap of sizzling humanity, the rainbow smeared with ash.[email protected]"

Five others were absconding.The rioting broke out on Wednesday here at a temple festival, when the police made a bid to disperse a 1000 strong crowd, after a mob unleashed bulls for Erudhattam.The district administration had denied permission for the conduct of Erudhattam during the Venkatesan Swamy temple car festival. The village temple committee had made an undertaking that no Erudhattam would be organised at the venue. Based on this, the crowd was permitted to assemble. However, a mob unleashed bulls in violation, forcing the skeletal police force at the venue to intervene. The mob hurled stones at the police injuring many. Police jeeps and a fire service vehicle was destroyed. Following this, police companies were deployed at the venue. Curiously, the police FIR does not record the destruction of police jeeps. The FIR has named the accused for destruction of fire service vehicle and attacking fire and rescue personnel."

Two vehicles belonging to the police and one of the fire services were damaged.An irate spectator-mob hurled stones at the skeletal police force that was deployed to disperse a little over 1000 people who had gathered at the venue.The event was organised without permission from the district administration as part of the Sri Prasanna Venkateswara temple festivities.Though permission was denied for the event, video footage showed a mass assembly of people at the venue, with barricades erected and banners announcing ""Jallikattu"" put up by the organisers. Video recordings of the event showed spectators running helter-skelter, several hurling stones at a few policemen who were running for cover.Collector S. Prabhakar said permission was denied for the erudhattam two days ago, and police were deployed in the village. However, the temple committee had taken permission from the local police, claiming that only the temple festival would be held and not erudhattam.But a few men had brought in a few cattle and let it run. When police tried to stop it, a 500-strong mob turned violent. Police personnel were deployed at Madakondapalli, and a Superintendent of Police and two Deputy Superintendents were at the spot to ensure peace. Over 30 people had been secured, the Collector toldThe Hindu.The incident is the fourth such case of illegal erudhattam organised in the district over the past fortnight. Last week, two bulls and a cow were killed in an erudhattam held without permission here in Rayakottai, leading to a stringent monitoring by the administration."

Islamabad’s counsel in Jadhav case seeks dismissal of India’s claim for relief
",,"Pakistan’s counsel Khawar Qureshi and Attorney-General Anwar Mansoor Khan concluded the Kulbhushan Jadhav hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Thursday, by calling for India’s claim for relief to be dismissed or declared inadmissible, on the basis of the appeal options being available to him in Pakistan. The two cited an FIR that had been filed at a civilian court in Pakistan.“India seeks relief which they cannot receive from the court,” insisted Mr. Khan.The legal team also launched a wider attack on India, invoking the Kathua rape case, the Samjhauta Express bombing, the Gujarat riots and the use of pellet guns in Kashmir as instances of failures of India’s judicial system and human rights record. Mr. Qureshi began with a personal attack on India and a number of its senior figures, including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and India’s counsel Harish Salve, accusing New Delhi of inhabiting a “wonderland” in “desperation and total disregard for the truth”.Revision system“Pakistan has a very robust revision and reconsideration system,” Mr. Khan told the court. In Pakistan — as is the case in other countries — military court proceedings are sometimes subject to state security considerations and therefore secrecy is maintained, he said.“We want cooperation with India, we want peaceful coexistence with India but that will not [happen] until India stops sending serving officers across the border for espionage and sabotage,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said following the hearing.“India’s position is that of wonderland. Indeed it is of a rotund character with a fragile cranium. Pakistan is not the one who brought him into this court,” Mr. Qureshi said, in an apparent reference to Mr. Salve, who had on Wednesday slammed the language and tone of Mr. Qureshi’s opening arguments.Judgments by the ICJ are made on an average within six months of the hearings concluding, though this can vary from a shorter period to a couple of years.Decision is bindingThe decision of the court is binding, and non-appealable, though it is possible to make a request for interpretation if there is a dispute between the two sides as to what the judgment means or what its scope is.There is also a possibility to request a review of the judgment if a “matter comes to light” that the court was previously unaware of and which could be a “decisive factor”.While requests for interpretation have on occasion been accepted, no requests for review have been successful to date."

Actor-director Aparna Sen talks about the importance of creative freedom, the subtext in her narratives and how the actor and director in her shape each other
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Like her films, Aparna Sen has a lot to say. Like her films, it is seldom on the surface; it is only when you process it that you get the essence. The celebrated actor-director was in Delhi recently to participate in an international symposium on ‘Creativity and Freedom’. As a film writer, one is always keen to know what was playing on the director’s mind when she shaped certain characters. For Aparna, one has a long list. From trivial details like why she named the photographer inParomaas Rahul Rai to the question if she was drawing from personal experience when she was writing the Rakhee-starrer, as Aparna was herself photographed by a celebrated photographer forLife.Aparna says, “no”, with a smile. She reveals that she met Raghu Rai much later though she was aware of his work. She admits that some things that exist in the subconscious mind do slip into the narrative. Perhaps, it addresses more complex questions like the bond between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law in herParomitar Ek Din(House of Memories) or giving a woman agency in a communal riot-like situation inMr. & Mrs. Iyer.Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the theme: ‘Creativity and Freedom’?I believe this is the raging topic of the day because your creative freedom is being suppressed in so many areas. You can’t write, paint, make films without worrying about some faction or other whose ‘sentiments’ will be hurt! If you critique the state of affairs in your country in any way, you are branded an anti-national.Many different groups of people have become more sensitive than they used to be. They are well within their rights to object to something a filmmaker may have said, but they indulge in rioting or vandalising cinemas or forcibly stopping entry into theatres. The state governments, which should be dealing with such law and order problems, put a stay on the release of the film.Did you ever face censorship?DuringMr. and Mrs. Iyer, some dialogues were cut out in Mumbai and Pune, if I remember correctly. The consensus was that what had been said about Muslims in the film would enrage them and create law and order problems. But you have to take into account the intent of the film. One person or a character saying something derogatory about a Muslim doesn’t mean that the filmmaker herself is against the community. Unfortunately, a scene or a piece of dialogue in a film is taken out of context and judged.Your films had female characters at the centre of the narrative much before it became a trend. What were your concerns?Look, I make films about individuals. But I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act. But I don’t make a film as a platform for my politics. When I make a film about a woman, it is possible that my feminist politics surfaces somewhere but it is not with the intention of propagating feminism.I certainly am a feminist but, in my cinema, I don’t talk about any ‘isms’. I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How has it evolved over the years?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films. But most of them and many feminist filmmakers, in particular, were talking about women negotiating space for themselves in a male-dominated society. Women were mostly shown as persons trying to fulfil their own potential. A notable exception isMahanagarby Satyajit Ray. Here you find a very early feminist narrative where the man and the woman are treated as equal. At the end of the film, when both are without jobs, both stand looking out at the city stretched out before them, and the husband says, ‘In such a great metropolis, surely at least one of us will find a job?’ It is one of the best feminist films I have ever seen.After that, it was more about women trying to realising their own potential and their fight to do so. Any talk about female desire or sexual choice was strictly taboo. That’s why in 1985, my second filmParomacreated such a furore! Many people wanted it taken out of theatres. They felt that women’s freedom didn’t mean licence for adultery! My point is, licence according to whom? The male-dominated patriarchal system where the moment a woman exercises her sexual choice, it is called a ‘licence?’Today, the situation is completely different. Women filmmakers are now very comfortable in their shoes. They are comfortable making films about male characters, who are persecuted by other males or even females. Alankrita Shrivastava addressed the issue of female desire inLipstick Under My Burkha. Konkona Sen Sharma made a film (Death in the Gunj) about a young man where the macho world around him bullies him so much that he commits suicide.,How much do you invest in your characters?Hugely. In the process of fleshing them out in the script, they take on a life of their own. I had planned on having Violet Stoneham of36 Chowringhee Laneto go away to Australia in the end. That was then the reality of India in 1981. Anglo-Indians migrated all the time to England, or Australia, New Zealand or Canada. But I just couldn’t make her go! InYugant, which many outside of Bengal haven’t seen, the dissolution of a marriage was used as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the earth. The couple there were called Deepak and Anusuya. When I was making the film, the shooting went on for a long time as we had no money. In between, I was in New Jersey with my husband and suddenly one night, I started crying. When he asked why, I said, I was missing them so much. He asked, “Who?” “Deepak and Anusuya,” I said, “I haven't seen them for so long!” I get emotionally involved with my characters.Do the actor and director reside in two different compartments in your body?They merge. The actor comes to the fore when I am writing. I write dialogue, which very few actors have difficulty in speaking. Because when I am writing, the actor in me is silently acting it all out in her mind. And when I am directing actors, the actor in me is very helpful. If an actor asks me “Why am I saying this?” I can usually tell the actor how he or she can motivate himself/ herself.Is there ever a clash?Only when I am acting and directing at the same time. I had a problem inSonataas I had to keep running to the monitor after giving a shot.Like you, it seems Konkona also loves to explore the psychological space of charactersHer form is not too different, but hers is a new voice with a new perspective. She is another person.Is her style more technical?No, I don’t think it is technical. It is removed from the classical format. In the classical format, there is a beginning, a middle and an end. She opens with two people looking into the boot of a car, which is interesting because it is dramatic and intriguing with no formal 'introduction' to the characters as such.Why don't you make films in Hindi?I would love to make a film in Hindi. I don’t want to make it with stars though. I have tried that but it is a pain to pursue stars. In any case, markets are not as star-driven as they used to be. They are much more content driven now.What are you working on?I am making an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’sGhare Baire.I have called itGhaire Bairey Aaj,because itis set against a contemporary backdrop. It is about how the world outside impacts relationships at home. I hope it will release in April.I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act. But I don’t make a film as a platform for my politics.I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act.

This takes the number of vacant Assembly seats in the State to 21.With the disqualification of 18 MLAs and the death of former DMK president M. Karunanidhi and AIADMK MLA A.K. Bose, the number of vacant Assembly seats had gone up to 20 earlier.The seat fell vacant on Tuesday after the notification. The Election Commission has now six months to hold bypoll to this constituency.The former Minister was convicted by a special court in a case relating to unlawful assembly and rioting at Bagalur village near Hosur in 1998 and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.The Madras High Court refused to stay his conviction and suspend the sentence, following which he approached the Supreme Court.About 10 days back, the DMK presented a memorandum to the Speaker to declare the Hosur seat vacant. DMK president M.K. Stalin had said that it was surprising that the Speaker had not taken any steps to formally notify the vacancy to the Constituency.

Move comes ahead of 60th anniversary of an uprising against China in 1959
",,"China is barring foreign travellers from Tibet over a period of several weeks that includes a pair of sensitive political anniversaries questioning the legitimacy of Beijing’s rule over the Himalayan region.Travel agencies contacted on Wednesday said foreign tourists would not be allowed back into Tibet until April 1. It’s not clear when the ban started, although some monitoring groups said it began this month.The ban was confirmed by the online customer service portal of the Tibet Youth International Travel Service, as well as staff at the Tibet Vista and Go to Tibet travel agencies. Both are based in the southwestern city of Chengdu — the main jumping-off point for visits to Tibet. March 10 is the 60th anniversary of an abortive 1959 uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, while anti-government riots occurred on March 14, 2008, in the regional capital Lhasa.Annual occurrenceAlthough the foreigner travel ban is an annual occurrence, the occasion of the 60th anniversary is drawing added attention.Amid heavy security on the ground, Tibet is almost entirely closed to foreign journalists and diplomats and information about actual conditions there is difficult to obtain. In 2017, more than 25 million trips from around the world were made to Tibet, an increase of 10.6% over the year before, generating 37.9 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) in revenue, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Numbers of visits rose again last year to more than 33 million, a rise of 31.5%, Xinhua said."

Celebrating the next wave of cultural entrepreneurs who are making a case for local voices and ensuring new talent isn’t overlooked
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Art and culture have always had champions, but the last decade or so has seen a spurt in ideas, in initiatives, in cultural entrepreneurs. It is not a case of a new order replacing the old, but more a reaction to the times, feels artist and cultural theorist Ranjit Hoskote. “There is no singular, monolithic public anymore. Instead, we have a variety of micro publics,” he says, explaining that the new wave of ‘warriors’ who are reviving old traditions and working with local talent, is a response to this. “There is also a sense that there are no institutions that will support this kind of work. So people are going out and creating their own, which is a good thing,” he adds. Examples include artist Jagannath Panda, who revitalised Bhubaneswar’s old city with an art trail last year; Anurupa Roy of Katkatha, who works with puppetry; or Junoon Theatre Company’s Bombay Local series, that organises talks featuring theatre personalities, which are free to the public.Even as established platforms, like the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, have started exploring alternative spaces to showcase world-renowned artists, initiatives like five-year-old St+art are taking art projects right to where the people are. The difference: they also have sign artists, Gond painters and local artists painting walls alongside international names. The art scene today is made up of such small, interlocking, occasionally converging groups that create a diverse ecology. We look at a few who are making an impact, preserving our heritage, ensuring local voices are heard.Michaela and Karan TalwarHarkat, MumbaiGerman filmmaker Michaela — you would’ve spotted her in a cameo inGully Boy— and her husband Karan consider themselves artists “who don’t fit in institutions or in bars”. And their boutique arts studio, Harkat, is for others like them. “Most of pop culture is sparked off by artists working outside the establishment. So we felt we needed to create such a place,” says Michaela, 30. “We are to alternative spaces what Vice is to news.”Since they opened in 2014, Harkat — housed in Bungalow #75 under a canopy of mango and walnut trees — has turned its locality in Versova into a “theatre gully”. “When we started out, there were no alternative spaces. Now five have opened, following their own variations of our model,” says Karan, 31. Audiences are increasing, so are opportunities and venues for artists. “Theatremakers and performers have started thinking in terms of alternative spaces when designing their shows,” says Michaela, recalling how filmmaker Suresh Eriyat said Harkat’s audience for his film,Tokri, was the most receptive he’d encountered in India.Given the current lack of inclusivity in most media, it is heartening to note that almost everything they curate or programme passes through a ‘politics filter’. Proposals problematic about gender and the like are rejected, and in-house curations actively contribute to the conversations. Up next, expect their second in-house play,Jenny and Karl Marx. Details: harkat.inKavery PoovannaWandering Artist, ChennaiA lack of places that promote creativity led Poovanna, 40, to launch Wandering Artist two years ago. The intimate space in RA Puram, which has hosted artistes such as art director Thotta Tharani,sitaristPandit Deobrat Mishra, and pianist Anil Srinivasan, is the go-to place for workshops and performances today. “We also provide a stage for up-and-coming artists, free of cost, to render intimate performances, gather experiences, and hit mainstream media,”says the visual and performing artist, adding that they regularly host training programmes on theatre, art and dance to mentor new talent.But the journey has not been easy. Sustaining the arts is a challenge and looking for patrons is no mean feat. “Arts appreciation is important to encourage and preserve traditional art forms. At some level, we also feel that the notion that arts must be offered free of cost needs fine-tuning as every artist needs their bread and butter,” says Poovanna, who launched Bhuhu, an immersive traditional Indian fine arts course, at the cultural space this month, with modules in murals, sculpture, puppetry and more. Details: wanderingartist.inNabil and MohsinaThe Village Studio, GoaThe alternative art space, which opened its doors in 2017, recently changed hands — with founder Laila Vaziralli handing the reins to Nabil and Mohsina, erstwhile professionals from Bengaluru. While a shift in Goa’s music scene, from EDM and raves to live music and artistic communities, is what convinced the couple to make the move, they assure that Vaziralli (who is behind projects such as Kitsch Mandi and Junta) still curates the events at the studio. This includes performances by poets and indie artists, painting exhibitions, and projects involving the local community that take forward the photographer-turned-artist’s vision of a space that is not only for artists to showcase their work but also “where skills can be taught and learnt”.Their annual music fest and workshops on themes like Sufism were the highlights in December. “Hosting artists such as Papon, Benny Dayal and bands like Thakara has been fun and social media has played a huge role in connecting with them,” says Nabil, adding that costs are always a concern. “[Much of it goes] from our pockets. We don’t have sponsors or funders; we bring in a new gig every week to keep the studio engaging.”Akshat NauriyalSt+art, New DelhiThe walls of Lodhi Colony are awash with colour. Large murals with themes like women’s empowerment and climate change, are attracting residents and tourists alike. The first edition of the Lodhi Art Festival (on till March 15) features 30 new artists, from Sameer Kulavoor and Hanif Kureshi to international names like Daan Botlek (Netherlands) and Brandon Tay (Singapore).This is the latest initiative by non-profit St+art to embed art in streets. “When we began in 2014, art was, to a certain extent, the commodity of the elite. The only exposure people had was if they went to a museum or gallery. So we wanted to take it out of the ‘white cube’ and embed it in public spaces,” says Nauriyal, a drummer and new-media artist who’s always had “an affinity to the alternative underbelly of the city”. In the last five years, they’ve organised 15 festivals in seven cities (including Coimbatore, Chandigarh and Goa), partnered with over 250 artists, painted over 275 walls across the country and started three art districts — in Lodhi, Maqhta (Hyderabad) and Mahim (Mumbai).The larger idea is also to create an ecosystem for local artists. “There is enough talent out there, it just needs a push and a framework,” says the 34-year-old. Rooted in social activism and urban design, their work “draws from the space, the project and the artists’ curation”. There is also an emphasis on working with Indian artisans and art traditions. “We’ve worked with sign painters, Gond and Madhubani artists... putting their amazing art forms on the same contemporary platform as the rest. This leads to an exchange of ideas, cultures and techniques,” he says. If you can’t make it to Lodhi, check out the festival in Maqhta in March-April.

Her latest project is indiastreetlettering.com, a map-based photographic archive of street lettering from across the country. “Letters in public environments have always interested me. They make an essential part of our visual culture,” says Saxena, 31.Although she feels that the walks she organises are not “needed”, they are interesting because they allow participants to see a place with a new perspective. “I liken them to a design appreciation course, condensed into a couple of hours and conducted in the wild,” she says, adding that similar walks are conducted by Tanya George in Mumbai and Zenab Bastawala in Bengaluru.Being a one-woman operation limits the scope of expanding her work to different neighbourhoods and conducting them more often. But each of the walks she organised in 2018 — from the Paharganj Airbnb Experience to Nicholson Cemetery Type Walk — has been sold out. “I feel confident that non-designers enjoy seeing and discussing design, and sometimes it is us, designers, that couch it in so much jargon that it becomes unapproachable.” Deatils: matratype.comAbhishek MajumdarPlaywright and theatre director, BengaluruIn the 10 years since he co-founded theatre company, Indian Ensemble, with Sandeep Shikhar, Majumdar has seen his plays staged across the world.

The organisation will also focus on diversity and insurance for theatre artistes.Uday Kapur and Mo JoshiAzadi Records, New DelhiGiven today’s socio-economic climate, Kapur, 26, feels that an independent record label promoting local artistes is the need of the hour. “We wanted to create an organisation that helps bring music (the forward-thinking, politically conscious kind) from marginalised sections, and introduce new stories to the music industry. Such as Prabh Deep’s, and the affects of the anti-Sikh riots on his community,” says Kapur, who was inspired to start Azadi Records after writing his thesis on Indian protest musicians such as Indian Ocean and Imphal Talkies and The Howlers.Rohan Narayana MurtyMurty Classical Library of India, GugaonA passion for literature may be surprising in a computer scientist, but we’re glad he loves words.

He says the impact of their releases (all well received) has stretched beyond the music industry. “People within Tilak Nagar have started conversing about substance abuse after Prabh’s album dropped. We hope the Aarey [deforestation] movement will get a push with Swadesi’s track. Overall, we hope to paint an accurate, nuanced picture of what’s going on in the country,” he shares.While money is always a challenge — “we’ve only put our own money in so far,” says co-founder Joshi — digital is key to getting their music out. “We’re still small footprint-wise, but we get relatively good engagement and are growing at a good pace. We’ve collaborated with different platforms (Saavn, SoundCloud) and plan to do more this year,” concludes Joshi.

The first edition of Women of Rhythm was held in Mumbai in 2016, and was dedicated to the first ladies of instruments like theghatam,mridangam,pakhawajandtabla. “At the time, I looked at it as a one-off concert, but we ended up building it. The initiative is geared towards breaking gender disparity, giving visibility, creating awareness and, most importantly, showcasing talent,” she says. “We’ve worked with some phenomenal artistes likevidushisSukanya Ramgopal and Dandamudi Sumathi Ramamohan Rao, and younger artistes like Charu Hariharan, Neesha Mokal and Mitali Vinchurkar,” she adds.For Acharya, one of the successes is that “almost all the percussionists featured in WOR have started to get regular, well-paid, quality work. I’m looking forward to the edition where we can get international artistes and have them collaborate with Indian artistes”. Currently, WOR is undergoing structural changes to create more video content. This year, they are also planning to take the property to different cities, with collaborative, theme-based concerts.Hinesh JethwaniIndian Hippy, MumbaiWhen Jethwani’s career hit a bump in 2008 — his IT business tanked during recession — a collection of newspaper clippings and a fascination for the dying art of hand-painted movie posters gave him new purpose. “It didn’t start off as a business plan; I had a lot of time on my hands and I wanted to do an experiment, to see what the artists were capable of and how people would react to it,” recalls the 38-year-old. An unusual plan for someone who did not enjoy Bollywood films growing up!Tracking them down was the difficult part (“I walked around Dadar, Matunga and the Shivaji Park area, which had had a lot of art studios”). The ensuing conversations found form in Indian Hippy, a collective of 12 poster and banner artists. In the last decade, they’ve succeeded in popularising the art form, creating everything from customised posters to 25-foot canvases for hotels like Stillwell Hotel in Los Angeles. “Restaurants mostly want hand-pained art, like wall canvases, or memorabilia (his website, bollywoodmovieposters.com, is dedicated to the latter),” says Jethwani, adding, “We also use digital to our advantage, like at a recent wedding where the client ordered nine posters of the bride and groom (in movies likeDilwale Dulhania Le JayengeandTanu Weds Manu) and blew them up into 10x12 foot banners.”However, he is aware there is an expiry date to his venture. Of the original collective, only five artists remain and “age has caught up with most of them”. The attempt now is to ensure continuity. “We want to get the younger generation fascinated about this beautiful hand-painted art,” he concludes. Details: hippy.inRashmi DhanwaniThe Art X Company, Mumbai“How do you articulate a sense of value for something as intangible as culture?” The question led Dhanwani, 34, to the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA), Mumbai, where she was instrumental in launching its first outreach department, creating direct engagement with the audience. This also helped her set the stage for starting Art X in 2015. “I wanted to create an organisation that was genre-agnostic when discussing access to the cultural sector. One that could create tangible points of engagement,” she explains.From understanding the demands of the audience to what sectors of the community haven’t been included in performance culture, the last three years have seen her curating ventures across the country where, she says, the amount of talent is “immense”.This year, she’s also looking ahead, organising culture meets in eight of India’s metros and gearing up for a host of interesting projects. “We’re working with the Serendipity Arts Festival in Goa and seeing another client that’s interested in research and curation,” she says. Details: art-x.coBabitha GeorgeUnbox Festival, Delhi-BangaloreYes, the festival explores the intersection of art, technology and design, but it has fun doing it — with talks on the anatomy of an AI to experiments in a food lab, and even a session on conspiracy theories. “We noticed that people tend to keep going to the same spaces and communities. So we wanted to create a space where a person could address a question with someone they’d never have been able to work with,” explains George, one of the co-founders.Begun by interdisciplinary consultancy, Quicksand Design Studio, in 2011, the fifth edition (it took a break after 2014) recently concluded in Bengaluru. One of the many highlights was a workshop by professor Justin Marshall, of the University of Northumbria, which expanded on his work with block printers from Jaipur, looking at how conductive ink can be used to think of new manifests for block printing. “This year we had around 100-odd pieces of programming, which sparked a lot of discussions,” shares the 38-year-old, adding that, going forward, the festival will continue to help create a vibrant network between Indian and international artists, thinkers and performers. Details: unboxfestival.comHimanshu VermaRed Earth, JaipurHe moved to Jaipur a year ago, to escape the bustle of Delhi, but that’s the only shift Verma, 38, is making. He continues to be India’s ‘sari man’ — exploring contemporary masculinity and its fluidity through the “open-ended garment” — even as his travelling show, The Saree Festival (started in 2014), explores the drape’s various styles and design-led interventions.For over a decade now, his multi-arts initiative, Red Earth, has also been creating conversations on Indian aesthetics. “A lot of my work is centered around seasons and festivals, to keep the connection with Indian aesthetics alive,” he says. The last edition of the Monsoon Festival had digital miniatures by graphic designers, alongside traditional oil canvases and contemporary works from artists like Anjana Mehra. His latest is the Cabinet of Curiosities, which he débuted in Jaipur last month and plans to bring to Mumbai and Chennai soon. “We created our version of the cabinet, with a mix of design, crafts from Jaipur, and works of contemporary artists like Olivia Fraser, Jyoti Bhatt and Akanksha Agarwal. The curation challenged how things [are perceived and] should be.” Details: redearthindia.comHarpreet KaurArts Manager, LondonKaur is a product of happy accidents — from her parents’ immigration to the UK to a childhood viewing of the works of the British-Asian Theatre Company, Tamasha, which fostered a huge interest in theatre, arts and diaspora rights. “It’s all about how creative projects are looking at social change. That’s my focus,” she says.Years of freelancing, often working alongside the Arts Council England, have made her one of Britain’s cultural experts, according to the BBC. And yet, the need of the hour, she says, is inclusivity, in all its forms. “There’s a need for everyone’s voices to be heard, and the arts council has allowed us to constantly examine diversity in gender, race issues, disability, and a range of socially-relevant issues,” explains, Kaur, who works primarily with the diaspora, like a recent programme that allowed Hindustani artists to tell their stories to the British upper-class.Her most recent arena of focus? Climate change. Delving into international research and development, she says the cultural lens can have a much greater impact than anyone possibly imagines. “This work — what I get the opportunity to do — it’s priceless, and someone has to do it. I’m just grateful that that person is me.”Quasar Thakore PadamseeQ Theatre Productions(QTP), MumbaiDecember in Mumbai, for theatre lovers at least, evoke memories of Thespo, the “under 25” festival that turned 20 last year. While he is quick to emphasise that the initiative is “way bigger than those who started it” — Quasar co-founded QTP at 20, with his friends — he still remains a prominent “oracle” figure, who dispenses advice. His initiative is credited with giving theatre practitioners a way to make their interests more than just a hobby.“When we started, the emphasis was on showcase. Then it became training, and now it’s about exposure, and we have a lot of collaborations with international performers,” says Quasar, 40, the son of late advertising veteran Alyque Padamsee. Internationally-acclaimed puppeteers, mime performers, and solo artists conduct workshops here, and their plays highlight India’s theatrical diversity. A few months before the festival starts, a jury tours the country auditioning performances. You can look forward to his upcoming play,Every Brilliant Thing, in March.Sofar SoundsWhat started as a small gathering of six in an apartment in London 10 years ago is today a community of over a thousand musicians, artistes and hosts. The name behind ‘intimate and unique gigs’ across the globe, Sofar Sounds (founded by music entrepreneur Rafe Offer, with friends Rocky Start and Dave Alexander), has had a presence in India since 2011, says Sarah Lipman, Head of Communications. A community that is all about hosting new artists and fresh music, she shares how many artists tell them how hard it is to establish a career. “We offer them an opportunity to share their music with a full, attentive audience eager to hear something new,” says Lipman, adding how hosting shows in untraditional spaces — like boutiques, cafés, people’s homes — is their USP. “Finding venues is always a challenge. We are always on the hunt for new ones!” While they have worked with all kinds of emerging artists, from spoken word to hip-hop, musicians such as Leon Bridges, Lianne LaHavas and Ed Sheeran have also been a part of their gigs. ““We have hosted names like Parvaaz, Tajdar Junaid and Prateek Kuhad at Sofars in India,” she says."

‘Don’t use riots, terror attacks for politics’
",,"A day after sealing a seat-sharing pact with the BJP, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday asked the NDA government not to behave in a way that would fuel allegations that it was trying to wage a war to influence poll results.Riots and terror attacks should not be used for “political gains”, the Sena said in an editorial in the party mouthpieceSaamana.Targeting students from Kashmir over such incidents could spell more trouble for the government, it warned.The BJP and the Sena announced a seat-sharing arrangement for the upcoming Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly elections after overcoming strained ties and earlier declarations of going solo.Without taking names, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said, “Sometime back there were political allegations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could wage a small-scale war to win elections... The rulers should not behave in a way in whcih these allegations would gather strength.”Referring to the February 14 Pulwama bombing in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, the Marathi daily said, “The country is still boiling over the terror attack, hence some may face criticism. [But] riots and terror attacks should not be used for political gains.”Cautioning the government that the recent attacks on students from Kashmir in other parts of the country could spell more trouble, it recalled the 1984 anti-Sikh riots after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and said the Congress was still “paying a heavy price” for it.It also took a dig at certain lawmakers for their comments on India-Pakistan relations in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack.Noting that Punjab Congress minister Navjot Singh Sidhu was ousted from a television show after he called for dialogue with Pakistan even after the Pulwama attack, the Sena said pressure was mounted on him and a campaign launched against him over the remarks.On the other hand, the comments of BJP legislator Nepal Singh, who recently stirred a controversy with his statement that Army jawans “ought to die”, were selectively ignored and he did not face any action, it pointed out.It said, “Our intelligence officials can trace an e-mail purportedly referring to a threat to the Prime Minister’s life but they fail to stop terror attack on a convoy.”Before 2014, Modi and RSS held the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government responsible for every terror attack in the country.“Then it should be understood if someone expects the current Prime Minister to uproot terrorism from the country,” it said.Our intelligence officials can trace an e-mail purportedly referring to a threat to the PM’s life but fail to stop attack on a convoy.Editorial insaamana"

Incident staged to disturb communal harmony, say police.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"An incident of alleged kidnapping of a female school teacher turned parts of the Labpur block in the Birbhum district into a battlefield on Sunday. The mob attacked the local police station with stones, while the police alleged that the objective of the purported kidnapping was to disturb communal peace in the area. Three persons, including the father of the allegedly kidnapped woman, Suphravat Batyabal, a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, were arrested. Interestingly, the Trinamool Congress’s (TMC) district leadership also indicated that their local TMC MLA is possibly involved in the kidnapping of the 22-year-old school teacher.Tension gripped Labpur on Saturday as a mob smashed the local TMC MLA Manirul Islam’s vehicle and chased him, forcing him to take refuge in the local police station. They alleged that Mr. Islam was involved in the kidnapping of the local school teacher. The mob attacked the police station, where Mr. Islam took shelter, and pelted stones on the forces for a couple of hours.The incident took place four days after Mr. Baytabal’s daughter was allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint at Labpur. The woman's mother lodged a complaint at the Labpur Police Station. She, however, did not mention any names but claimed that “unknown miscreants” kidnapped her daughter, district police officials said. Following the arrest of the woman’s father on Sunday, an Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) of Birbhum told journalists that the entire incident was “staged to implement a political agenda.”“We have arrested the boys (Raju Sardar and Dipankar Mondal), who apparently kidnapped the woman, from Dalkhola in north Bengal. They met the kidnapped woman’s father Supravat Batyabal [who, too, was arrested] earlier in the week and plotted the kidnapping,” said the police officer.Mr. Batyabal, who was a member of Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), switched to the TMC after the CPI-M’s defeat in 2011. Mr. Batyabal joined the BJP recently. Police said that the rescued teacher is in a state of shock.The district leadership of the BJP, which has grown substantially in Birbhum over the last few years, alleged that the miscreants were TMC-backed goons.However, the Birbhum chief of the TMC, Anubrata Mondal, alleged that both the BJP and Manirul Islam, TMC’s MLA, are involved in the kidnapping of the girl. “When the girl was interrogated, she said that her father and Mani uncle [Manirul Islam] masterminded the plan. Even if anyone is attached to the party [the TMC] and encouraging such acts, the person won’t be spared. No one is a Governor here,” said Mr. Mondal.Police officials, however, refused to comment on Mr. Islam’s involvement.(With agency inputs.)"

But following two incidents in quick succession, his confidence in Kolkata started receding.On Saturday morning, a group of men encircled him at his doorstep and told him they would “destroy” his family if he did not leave for Kashmir in 24 hours. The men, unarmed and in their 20s, abused him and Kashmiris, for the Pulwama attack. A similar incident took place on Friday evening.“They repeatedly said that they would harm my family and wife,” Dr. Dar said, sitting in his spacious living room in south Kolkata’s Tiljala area. The doctor from Srinagar’s Government Medical College requested that he should not be identified, or his family or even his neighbourhood.The earlier incident, the first after the Pulwama attack, took place on Friday evening as Dr. Dar stepped out to buy groceries. “A separate set of men encircled me, identified me as a Kashmiri and threatened me,” he said.Following the incidents, Dr. Dar wrote to the Chief Minister, who did not respond, but the chairperson of the State’s Child Rights Commission, Ananya Chakraborty, called to ensure his safety. Earlier, the Home Ministry had issued an advisory to the States to provide safety to Kashmiris. Dr. Dar thanked a Kashmiri journalist for circulating his post where he appealed for “protection”, which went viral.Among the early respondents was a Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) activist Sumaan Sengupto. He spoke to his friend Samim Ahmed, a noted writer, and informed the police.“I think the officer informed the local Tiljala Police Station and they acted promptly,” Sengupto said.Kolkata has about 50 Kashmiri women and men working in mostly in the private sector. The number goes up in the winter as the families of Kashmiri residents visit the city. Besides, an unknown number of dry fruit and garments retailers have visited the city periodically, over decades. The police do not have any record of them. “Because we never had any major problem with the Kashmiris visiting the city,” said a retired Commissioner of Kolkata Police.One of the two Kolkata police personnel posted outside Dr. Dar’s flat said that they are “posted in shifts to provide round-the-clock security.” Dr. Dar said that officials were meeting him periodically, exchanging “a few friendly words to boost confidence” while his phone had not stopped ringing since the post went viral. Following such support, Dr. Dar changed his mind by late evening on Saturday.“There are so many people around, so many are offering us to stay with them, calling or visiting us. I’m feeling happy and secured,” he said. However, he still is worried about his two daughters, who go to a nearby school. “Is it possible to provide security to the kids throughout the year?” he asks.Meanwhile, the public address system perched on the roof of the mobile vans of Kolkata Police are asking people to “maintain calm and peace,” while small rallies are brought out to advocate an attack on Pakistan."

Western Railway cancels 54 local trains; several long-distance trains delayed, some short-terminated at Borivali and Palghar ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Hundreds of protesters blocked the railway tracks at Nallasopara and Virar on Saturday morning to condemn the terrorist attack in Pulwama that killed over 40 CRPF jawans. Suburban and long-distance train services were affected for around four hours due to the protest.According to officials of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) there were more than 500 protesters. The crowd started gathering around 8 a.m., and the tracks were cleared by noon.Preeti Bahot, a commuter from Nallasopara, had to wait for hours for a train. “I reached the station by 8 a.m., as I do every day. I had no clue about the protest, which started around the same time,” she said. Ms. Bahot, who works in Churchgate, said protesters initially also pelted stones, before women on board a local train told them to stop. “The crowd kept increasing and there were easily more than a thousand people at the station. As nobody knew about the protest, commuters kept coming,” she said.Lathi chargeSecurity staff had to resort to lathi charge to clear the crowd. “There was no headway for over three hours, despite a dialogue with protesters,” a senior official said.“We are registering cases against the protesters for unlawful assembly and rioting. We will use video footage to identify those behind this,” Purushottam Karad, Deputy Commissioner of Police, GRP (Western), said.Additional Superintendent of Police, Vasai, Vijaykant Sagar said the situation was brought under control around noon. “We appeal to people to protest peacefully over the martyrdom of our jawans and urge protesters not to inconvenience others or create a law and order situation,” he said.Rage and fury: Hundreds of protesters block the railway tracks at Nallasopara station to vent their anger over the Pulwama terror attack, on Saturday.

Passengers expressed their plight on social media.Western Railway (WR) could operate local services only between Churchgate and Vasai. Trains resumed a little after noon, but the backlog forced WR to cancel several trips. In all, WR had to cancel 54 services through the day, and morning services ran around 20 minutes late. Several long-distance trains, such as Vivek Express which runs between Bandra Terminus and Jammu Tawi, were delayed, while others were short terminated in Borivali and Palghar."
Mamata questions timing of Pulwama terror attack,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mamata-questions-timing-of-pulwama-terror-attack/article26305191.ece,"
Refers to ‘intelligence inputs’, fixing of responsibility
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday raised questions on the timing of the terrorist attack at Pulwama before the Lok Sabha polls, and asked why the incident was not prevented despite “intelligence inputs.”“How have they [Pakistan] got this encouragement before elections? After Parliament is over, when this type of thing happen, as a citizen of the country, I am in doubt. Why have we not taken action against Pakistan earlier? Why at the time of elections, you tell me?” Ms. Banerjee questioned at the State Secretariat.Referring to the suicide attack that killed at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel at Pulwama on February 14, the Chief Minister said that, like all in the Opposition, she wants strong action against terrorists, but emphasised the need to fix responsibility. “Why were 2005 jawans in 78 vehicles were allowed in one convoy when the government had intelligence inputs and information that attacks could happen?” Ms. Banerjee said.“Now we see that we are quiet and [PM] Modi and Amit Shah are making speeches everyday, and through these speeches it appears that only they are patriotic and we are all foreigners,” she said.The Trinamool Congress (TMC) chairperson repeatedly referred to “intelligence inputs” and, browsing through her phone, claimed to have a copy of an intelligence notification of February 8. “My phone is tapped by intelligence agencies. I am telling you officially that I have evidence of it and I will place it before you at the right time,” she said.‘Fomenting trouble’Ms. Banerjee also alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other pro-Hindutva organisations were stoking public outrage following theattack to incite unrest in West Bengal. “I want to appeal to the right-minded people of West Bengal that the citizens of this country have the right to stay anywhere,” she said.The CM alleged that the BJP, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) are taking out late night processions with national flags and targeting people of different communities. “It is a planted game of the RSS, VHP and the BJP. We will resist attempts to take political advantage of the situation,” she said, directing the police to take action against those indulging in riots.BJP hits backsWest Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh hit back at Ms. Banerjee, saying that while the entire country is demanding “tough action against the enemy”, the TMC is opposing tough action against Pakistan. While Mr. Ghosh said that the Chief Minister is “seeing the ghost of BJP everywhere, particularly when the law and order situation of the State has collapsed,” he also wanted to know what was stopping her government from announcing an ex-gratia compensation for the two slain CRPF jawans from the State."

",,"In the aftermath of the terror attack in Pulwama on Thursday, the Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) on Saturday asked Delhi Police to be on high alert for those trying to vitiate the atmosphere in the Capital.“In view of the deteriorating communal situation in various parts of the country, including Delhi, in the wake of the terrorist attack in Pulwama,” DMC chairperson Zafarul-Islam Khan had written to Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik seeking directions to police stations to be alert, a DMC statement said.Provocative slogans“There are attacks on Kashmiris, even on ordinary Muslims, in various parts of the country in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Pulwama. Even in Delhi attempts are being made to vitiate the atmosphere and start riots,” the DMC chairperson wrote in his email to the commissioner.He alleged that there were rallies raising “provocative slogans” being taken out in “Muslim areas and in front of Muslim homes in mixed population areas”.“Unless Delhi Police is alert and proactive, riots will erupt like those in Jammu city for instance. Kindly, order all police stations in Delhi to be alert, proactive and responsive to the need to keep peace and amity at all costs,” the email stated.Delhi Police, for its part, said it was on high alert following the attack that killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama.Ensure safety“The city has been put on high alert.

We’ll ensure safety and security of every citizen,” said a Delhi police spokesperson."
"I deal only with individuals. Even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined: Aparna Sen",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-deal-only-with-individuals-even-if-an-ism-surfaces-it-is-not-underlined/article26272530.ece,"
In a freewheeling chat, ace actor-director Aparna Sen talks about the importance of creative freedom, the subtext in her narratives, and how the actor and director in her inform each other ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Like her films, Aparna Sen has a lot to say. Like her films, it is seldom on the surface; it is only when you process it that you get the essence. The celebrated actor-director was in Delhi recently to participate in an international symposium on ‘Creativity and Freedom’, organised by the Kolkata-based CIMA Gallery, Ashoka University and India International Centre. As a film writer, one is always keen to know what was playing on the director’s mind when she shaped certain characters. For Aparna, one has a long list. From trivial details like why did she name the photographer in “Paroma” as Rahul Rai? Did the fact that Aparna was herself photographed by a celebrated photographer for Life magazine play on her mind when she was writing the Rakhee-starrer? Aparna says, “no”, with a smile. She reveals that she met Raghu Rai much later though she was aware of his work. During the course of the interview, she admits that some things that exist in the subconscious mind do slip into the narrative. Perhaps, it addresses the more complex questions like the bond between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law in her “Paromitar Ek Din” (House of Memories) or giving a woman agency in a communal riot-like situation in “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”.Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the theme: ‘Creativity and Freedom’?Well, not only cinema but in every sphere! I believe this is the raging topic of the day because your creative freedom is being suppressed in so many areas. At the drop of a hat, people have begun to take offence. You can’t write, paint, make films without worrying about some faction or other whose ‘sentiments’ will be hurt! If you critique the state of affairs in your country in any way, you are branded an anti-national. Freedom of expression, which is a fundamental democratic right granted to us by our constitution, is under threat today.Many different groups of people have become more sensitive than they used to be. They are well within their rights to object to something a filmmaker may have said, but they often indulge in rioting or vandalising cinema halls or forcibly stopping entry into theatres. The various state governments, which should be dealing with such law and order problems, put a stay on the release of the film. For a creative person, the atmosphere is stifling!Rahul Bose and Konkana Sensharma in Aparna Sen's English film ""Mr. and Mrs. Iyer"".Did you ever face censorship?During ‘Mr. and Mrs. Iyer’, some dialogues were cut out in Mumbai and Pune if I remember correctly. The consensus was that what had been said about Muslims in the film would enrage them and create law and order problems. But you have to take into account the intent of the film. One person or a character saying something derogatory about a Muslim doesn’t mean that the filmmaker herself is against the community. In fact, she is trying to say that such comments should not be made. Unfortunately, a scene or a piece of dialogue in a film is taken out of context and judged.Your films had female characters at the centre of the narrative much before it became a trend. What were your concerns?Look, I make films about individuals. But I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act. But I don’t make a film as a platform for my politics. My real interest is the psychology of the individual. The individual herself is part of the system, part of many converging political ideologies. When I make a film about a woman, it is possible that my feminist politics surfaces somewhere but it is not with the intention of propagating feminism. I certainly am a feminist but, in my cinema, I don’t talk about any ‘isms’. I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How it has evolved over the years and if we could compare it with the present?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films. But most of them and many feminist filmmakers, in particular, were talking about women negotiating space for themselves in a male-dominated society. Women were mostly shown as persons trying to fulfil their own potential. A notable exception is ‘Mahanagar’ by Satyajit Ray. Here you find a very early feminist narrative where the man and the woman are treated as equal. At the end of the film, when both are without jobs, both stand looking out at the city stretched out before them, and the husband says, ‘In such a great metropolis, surely at least one of us will find a job?’ They are treated as equals by the filmmaker. Even if one of them finds a job, they can function as a family. It is one of the best feminist films I have ever seen.After that, it was more about women trying to realising their own potential and their fight to do so. Any talk about female desire or sexual choice was strictly taboo. That’s why in 1985, my second film ‘Paroma’ created such a furore! Many people wanted it taken out of theatres. They felt that women’s freedom didn’t mean licence for adultery! My point is, licence according to whom? The male-dominated patriarchal system where the moment a woman exercises her sexual choice, it is called a ‘licence?’Today, the situation is completely different. Women filmmakers are now very comfortable in their shoes. They are critiquing women even. They are comfortable making films about male characters, who are persecuted by other males or even females. Alankrita Shrivastava addressed the issue of female desire in ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’. Konkona Sen Sharma made a film (‘Death in the Gunj’) about a young man where the macho world around him bullies him so much that he commits suicide.Film Director and Actress Aparna Sen  
| Photo Credit:R_Shivaji RaoThere is a lot of subtext in your narratives; one could draw different meanings...‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ was about an Anglo-Indian school teacher and her dilemma about remaining in India. She chooses to remain. There is no jingoism here. She is not talking about her motherland,which she will not leave because she is patriotic. It was simply a personal decision of a woman who is unwilling to leave a place she has known all her life. She opts for the country that she was born and brought up in. In that sense, she is a true Indian. So, you can read the text that way too, if you wish. But I made it as a human being’s personal choice, which I find much more interesting. ‘Paroma’ was about a woman who exercised her personal choice and in the process came across the wrath of the family. Eventually, she realises who she is. She realises that she is a person in her own right. To that extent, it was about a woman discovering her own identity.Film director Mrinal Sen

Had she known, she would not have gone. I didn’t plan to make the characters as Hindu and Muslim to start with. I was just going to make a love story about two strangers who meet during a journey. They surfaced because of my deep involvement with secular politics. Meenakshi Iyer tells the rioters that she is the wife of her co-passenger, who is a Muslim, just to save his life. She herself had not known until that moment she would do so! In a physical journey, which is a wonderful metaphor for a journey into oneself, the woman discovers that humanity is more important to her than her caste or religion or gender identities. In spite of so much corruption and violence around us, I still have a deep and abiding faith in human goodness.In some of your films, we find women smoking? Isn’t it bad for both men and women?Of course, it is! But, people do smoke in real life you know! In any case, I haven't shown women smoking that much in my films. Some women do smoke, yes.For a long time, women smoking publicly became a kind of political statement. But, of course, it is bad for you. In ‘Paroma’, one of my characters smokes, but she is not the central character. In ‘Sati’, ‘Yugant’ or ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’, or ‘The Japanese Wife’,for instance, there are no such scenes.In ‘Sonata’, you resisted giving a name to the simmering desire between two women...There really was no ‘simmering desire’. There was just the hint of a grey area. It is left open. I like to leave such things open. Why should I always tell the audience what to think?How much do you invest in your characters?Hugely. In the process of fleshing them out in the script, they take on a life of their own. I had planned on having Violet Stoneham of ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ to go away to Australia in the end. That was then the reality of India in 1981. Anglo-Indians migrated all the time to England, or Australia, New Zealand or Canada. But I just couldn’t make her go! I get very to my characters. In ‘Yugant’, which many outside of Bengal haven’t seen, the dissolution of a marriage was used as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the earth. The couple there were called Deepak and Anusuya. When I was making the film, the shooting went on for a long time as we had no money. In between, I was in New Jersey with my husband and suddenly one night, I started crying. When he asked why, I said, I was missing them so much. He asked, “Who?” ‘Deepak and Anusuya,’ I said, ‘I haven't seen them for so long!’ I get emotionally involved with my characters. I care about how they think. They indicate to me how they should behave or what their dialogue should be.Do the actor and director reside in two different compartments in your body?They merge. The actor comes to the fore when I am writing. I write dialogue, which very few actors have difficulty in speaking. because when I am writing, the actor in me is silently acting it all out in her mind. And when I am directing actors, the actor in me is very helpful. I know exactly what problem the actor is facing. I understand the physical and motivational problems of the actors. If an actor asks me “Why am I saying this?” I can usually tell the actor how he or she can motivate himself/ herself.Is there ever a clash?Only when I am acting and directing at the same time. I had a problem in ‘Sonata’ as I had to keep running to the monitor after giving a shot.What are your memories of Mrinal Sen?To me, he was always a young man, even when he was old. He was mentally the youngest person I have known. Always ready to try something new, always fresh. That was the most wonderful thing about him. He was not afraid of experimenting and that is so necessary in order to develop the language of cinema. He tried to experiment with cinematic form and language as well as subject matter. I worked with him in two films, but he and his wife were family friends as well – friends of my parents.You also tried to experiment in Arshinagar...It is not an easy path because when you are experimenting, you are running into orthodox thought.Like you, it seems Konkona also loves to explore the psychological space of charactersHer form is not too different, but hers is a new voice with a new perspective. She is another person.Is her style more technical?No, I don’t think it is technical. It is removed from the classical format. In the classical format, there is a beginning, a middle and an end. She opens with two people looking into the boot of a car, which is interesting because it is dramatic and intriguing with no formal 'introduction' to the characters as such.Why don't you make films in Hindi?I would love to make a film in Hindi. I don’t want to make it with stars though. I have tried that but it is a pain to pursue stars. In any case, markets are not as star-driven as they used to be. They are much more content driven now.What are you working on?I am making an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Ghare Bairey’(The Home and the World). I have called it ‘Ghaire Bairey Aaj’,because itis set against a contemporary backdrop. It is about how the world outside impacts relationships at home. I don’t want to talk more about it beforehand. I hope it will release in April."

Some yellow vest protesters have expressed racist or anti-Semitic views online and on the sidelines of protests.“I felt an absolute hate,” Finkielkraut told the Sunday paper Le Journal du Dimanche. He expressed relief that police intervened.Lines of riot police used tear gas and an impressive backup, a special horse brigade and water cannons — apparently not used — to force the agitated crowd to disperse.The Paris prosecutor’s office said 15 people were detained for questioning, far less than the scores detained in earlier, larger demonstrations that degenerated into scattered rioting and destruction.Violence has marked most of the protests that started against fuel taxes and grew into a mass movement against Macron and his pro-business policies.However, the increasingly divided movement is having trouble maintaining momentum, and support from the public that initially massively backed protesters, polls showed.French media quoted the Interior Ministry as saying that 41,500 protesters nationwide turned out Saturday, some 10,000 less than the previous week, with 5,000 in Paris."

I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How it has evolved over the years and if we could compare it with the present?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films. But most of them and many feminist filmmakers, in particular, were talking about women negotiating space for themselves in a male-dominated society. Women were mostly shown as persons trying to fulfil their own potential. A notable exception is ‘Mahanagar’ by Satyajit Ray. Here you find a very early feminist narrative where the man and the woman are treated as equal. At the end of the film, when both are without jobs, both stand looking out at the city stretched out before them, and the husband says, ‘In such a great metropolis, surely at least one of us will find a job?’ They are treated as equals by the filmmaker. Even if one of them finds a job, they can function as a family. It is one of the best feminist films I have ever seen.After that, it was more about women trying to realising their own potential and their fight to do so. Any talk about female desire or sexual choice was strictly taboo. That’s why in 1985, my second film ‘Paroma’ created such a furore! Many people wanted it taken out of theatres. They felt that women’s freedom didn’t mean licence for adultery! My point is, licence according to whom? The male-dominated patriarchal system where the moment a woman exercises her sexual choice, it is called a ‘licence?’Today, the situation is completely different. Women filmmakers are now very comfortable in their shoes. They are critiquing women even. They are comfortable making films about male characters, who are persecuted by other males or even females. Alankrita Shrivastava addressed the issue of female desire in ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’. Konkona Sen Sharma made a film (‘Death in the Gunj’) about a young man where the macho world around him bullies him so much that he commits suicide.There is a lot of subtext in your narratives; one could draw different meanings...‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ was about an Anglo-Indian school teacher and her dilemma about remaining in India. She chooses to remain. There is no jingoism here. She is not talking about her motherland,which she will not leave because she is patriotic. It was simply a personal decision of a woman who is unwilling to leave a place she has known all her life. She opts for the country that she was born and brought up in. In that sense, she is a true Indian. So, you can read the text that way too, if you wish. But I made it as a human being’s personal choice, which I find much more interesting. ‘Paroma’ was about a woman who exercised her personal choice and in the process came across the wrath of the family. Eventually, she realises who she is. She realises that she is a person in her own right. To that extent, it was about a woman discovering her own identity.In “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”, the female protagonist rises above the barriers of caste and religion for a bigger cause.She was going to Kolkata, and she didn’t know that the bus would be caught in a riot. Had she known, she would not have gone. I didn’t plan to make the characters as Hindu and Muslim to start with. I was just going to make a love story about two strangers who meet during a journey. They surfaced because of my deep involvement with secular politics. Meenakshi Iyer tells the rioters that she is the wife of her co-passenger, who is a Muslim, just to save his life. She herself had not known until that moment she would do so! In a physical journey, which is a wonderful metaphor for a journey into oneself, the woman discovers that humanity is more important to her than her caste or religion or gender identities. In spite of so much corruption and violence around us, I still have a deep and abiding faith in human goodness.In some of your films, we find women smoking? Isn’t it bad for both men and women?Of course, it is! But, people do smoke in real life you know! In any case, I haven't shown women smoking that much in my films. Some women do smoke, yes.For a long time, women smoking publicly became a kind of political statement. But, of course, it is bad for you. In ‘Paroma’, one of my characters smokes, but she is not the central character. In ‘Sati’, ‘Yugant’ or ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’, or ‘The Japanese Wife’,for instance, there are no such scenes.In ‘Sonata’, you resisted giving a name to the simmering desire between two women...There really was no ‘simmering desire’. There was just the hint of a grey area. It is left open. I like to leave such things open. Why should I always tell the audience what to think?How much do you invest in your characters?Hugely. In the process of fleshing them out in the script, they take on a life of their own. I had planned on having Violet Stoneham of ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ to go away to Australia in the end. That was then the reality of India in 1981. Anglo-Indians migrated all the time to England, or Australia, New Zealand or Canada. But I just couldn’t make her go! I get very to my characters. In ‘Yugant’, which many outside of Bengal haven’t seen, the dissolution of a marriage was used as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the earth. The couple there were called Deepak and Anusuya. When I was making the film, the shooting went on for a long time as we had no money. In between, I was in New Jersey with my husband and suddenly one night, I started crying. When he asked why, I said, I was missing them so much. He asked, “Who?” ‘Deepak and Anusuya,’ I said, ‘I haven't seen them for so long!’ I get emotionally involved with my characters. I care about how they think. They indicate to me how they should behave or what their dialogue should be.Do the actor and director reside in two different compartments in your body?They merge. The actor comes to the fore when I am writing. I write dialogue, which very few actors have difficulty in speaking. because when I am writing, the actor in me is silently acting it all out in her mind. And when I am directing actors, the actor in me is very helpful. I know exactly what problem the actor is facing. I understand the physical and motivational problems of the actors. If an actor asks me “Why am I saying this?” I can usually tell the actor how he or she can motivate himself/ herself.Is there ever a clash?Only when I am acting and directing at the same time. I had a problem in ‘Sonata’ as I had to keep running to the monitor after giving a shot.Like you, it seems Konkona also loves to explore the psychological space of charactersHer form is not too different, but hers is a new voice with a new perspective. She is another person.Is her style more technical?No, I don’t think it is technical. It is removed from the classical format. In the classical format, there is a beginning, a middle and an end. She opens with two people looking into the boot of a car, which is interesting because it is dramatic and intriguing with no formal 'introduction' to the characters as such.Why don't you make films in Hindi?I would love to make a film in Hindi. I don’t want to make it with stars though. I have tried that but it is a pain to pursue stars. In any case, markets are not as star-driven as they used to be. They are much more content driven now.What are you working on?I am making an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Ghare Bairey’(The Home and the World). I have called it ‘Ghaire Bairey Aaj’,because itis set against a contemporary backdrop. It is about how the world outside impacts relationships at home. I don’t want to talk more about it beforehand. I hope it will release in April."
Stress points of democracy,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/stress-points-of-democracy/article26272814.ece,"
In this election year in India, we need to keep a sharper eye on the weakening of institutions ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"These are difficult, as also unsettling, times. It is not the complexity of issues that confront the world as much as the steady undermining of institutional and knowledge structures that are posing a threat to the world.Across the world, democracy is in obvious retreat, with authoritarian tendencies on the ascendant. Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan are constantly projected as the faces of authoritarianism, but many democratic leaders reveal a similar authoritarian streak, which adds to democracy’s woes. It may be too early to predict the demise of democracy, but the reality is that it is not a good time for democratic institutions, or for those who see democracy as the answer to the world’s problems.Examples everywhereSeveral examples exist worldwide on how decisions today are handed down, rather than being the outcome of discussion and debate. Hallowed international institutions such as the World Bank are facing the heat today for not conforming to the prescriptions of certain powerful members. At the same time, there are enough examples of democracy going awry. Brexit, and the Brexit debate, in the U.K. and Europe is a good example.The U.S., which prides itself as a leading democracy, is setting a bad example today. Under President Donald Trump, arbitrary decision-making has replaced informed debate. His diatribe against what he calls a “ridiculous partisan” investigation against him is an indication. Another is his determination to build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants, even risking an extended shutdown of the U.S. government. The decision of the U.S. to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty — a key pact signed in 1987, and hailed as the centrepiece of European security since the Cold War — without a detailed internal discussion appears to be setting the stage for Cold War 2.0.It is, however, the ignoring of democratic conventions nearer home that are cause for greater concern. In a pluralistic, multi-party federal system, disdain for democratic conventions and the violation of well-entrenched behavioural patterns are causing irreversible damage to the polity.Federal falloutCurrently, we are witnessing vituperative exchanges between the Prime Minister and some Chief Ministers which involve accusations such as fomenting riots and running extortion rackets. This damages the fabric of democracy. Centre-State relations are already under strain, and face the threat of still greater disruption.Selective interpretation of information is a fallout of such situations. Those in authority deem all information not acceptable to them as nothing but disinformation. Those opposed to the government, on the other hand, insist that the government suffers from a lack of probity. The current sulphurous exchanges between the ruling dispensation and the Opposition over the purchase of Rafale aircraft are an example. The casualty is truth, and the veracity of official facts and statistics.Many instances of this kind can be quoted, but one specific instance that has caught the fancy of the public is the current debate on jobs and unemployment. The Central government has effectively rejected a report by the well-regarded National Sample Survey Office — which showed that unemployment in 2017-18 was at a 45-year high — without giving any valid reason for doing so. The government’s only reasoning for rejecting the report is that it is a ‘draft’, which has only added to existing doubts about its real intentions. Similarly, doubts are being raised about the validity of the government’s revised GDP estimates.Breaches of democratic conventions are adding to the already existing disquiet. Adherence to democratic norms has for long been perceived as crucial to maintaining the independence of institutions and processes. An impression exists today that attempts are being made to effect changes in the existing system. Two instances during the past year when the government breached long-held conventions have raised questions about the intentions of those in authority.One was the brouhaha concerning the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and a perceived attempt to reduce its functional independence, to compel it to fall in line with the views of the government. The resignation of the RBI Governor put a temporary quietus to these concerns, but it is widely believed that the RBI has been brought into line with the government’s wishes. The second instance relates to the Interim Budget in an election year. The Interim Budget announced on the eve of the 2019 general election clearly breaches certain long-settled conventions, by including many substantial measures that ordinarily would form part of a regular Budget. The intention is plain, viz. build more support for the ruling dispensation in an election year.Alongside the decline in democratic conventions, another cause for concern is the virtual collapse of key institutions such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Touted as India’s premier investigation agency, its reputation has of late suffered a near mortal blow, mainly on account of internecine quarrels, as also external interference in its internal affairs. Created out of the Delhi Special Police Establishment in 1963, a brainchild of then-Home Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, the agency was earlier headed by persons with impeccable integrity and ability. It had also adhered previously to the salutary principle of not carrying out arrests, except in the most exceptional of circumstances. Over time, the quality of the CBI leadership and the tribe of proven investigators has witnessed a decline, which has impacted the image of the organisation.An agency of the government, part of the Ministry of Personnel functioning under the Prime Minister, supervised at one step removed by the Central Vigilance Commission, and constantly under the watch of the Supreme Court, the CBI serves many masters. The choice of Director, following the Vineet Narain case, by a committee headed by the Prime Minister, with the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of Opposition as the other members, has hardly helped the CBI maintain a reputation for independence. The recent unsavoury drama, which witnessed a ‘Kilkenny cat fight’ between the Director and his No. 2, reflects the lack of institutional culture in the organisation.Compounding the situation arising from the lack of trained and competent investigators is the fact that supervisory officers, who come and go, are most often not in a position to provide proper guidance to investigating officers. At times, they also tend to tinker with the investigation reports sent to them, to reject the findings of investigating officers.A changing work cultureWhat is worse is that while earlier the CBI used to carry out arrests of so-called accused persons only as a measure of last resort, today it is overturning this on its head. As its investigating officers’ skills have declined, it is increasingly resorting to peremptory arrests, often on very slender evidence, in anticipation of securing approvers to build, or strengthen, a case. The law generally disapproves of approver evidence, but this has become the stock in trade of the CBI. In many instances, the CBI has also been resorting to pressure tactics while questioning individuals, even when they are not accused persons, setting aside legal niceties and requirements. In a few instances recently, the CBI has even resorted to intimidatory tactics, taking recourse to a battery of investigators to question a witness, let alone an accused, in the hope of securing useful leads. The recent incident where a posse of CBI personnel went to question the Kolkata Police Commissioner at his residence late in the evening, though he was only a witness, reflects the changing mores of the CBI. This should be a matter of concern for one and all.M.K. Narayanan is a former National Security Advisor and a former Governor of West Bengal"

Alone on Valentine’s Day? That doesn’t mean you can’t treat yourself and your inner-techie
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"That wonderful day known as Valentine’s Day is the perfect excuse for couples to profess their love for each other. In small ways like ﬂowers and gifts, and in big gestures, like expensive dinners or romantic getaways.Either way, V-Day can be hard on all those single people. That does not need to be the case though, Valentine’s is about love and nothing says ‘I love myself’ more than gifting yourself a gadget companion. Here are some ideas.Just what the heart needsValentine’s Day is all about those matters of the heart, ﬁguratively. Why not take that meaning to a more literal level and buy yourself that Apple Watch 4 you’ve been lusting for, for so long. You see, under its sleek exterior lies an ECG, an electrocardiogram, that sends pulses to your heart to measure its health.Pinging you with advice when it notices any irregularities and even going as far as to alerting emergency services when you’re in danger of cardiac arrests. Plus, it’s nifty that it’s got that breathing reminder. Get yourself what your heart wants this V-Day.Crush on these assistantsNo matter how much you shy away from digital assistants, they are a riot. Even if they may one day take over the world as prophesied byThe Terminator, that’s a long way oﬀ, and while they’ve not evolved to the levels of the robots inEx-MachinaandHer, to be able to romance, they’re still fun to talk to.You can ask them any trivia question, dictate messages, ask them the time or to play music for you, they can tell you silly jokes and remind you of things you need to do. If you have a smart connected home, they can keep that temperature controlled and those lights nice and ambient. Who knows, not far into the future you may be able to actually converse with them. Till then, they’re a great voice to have in an empty house.Forget true love — go true wirelessFree yourself from pesky wire clutter and take that plunge into true wireless. A go-to are Apple’s AirPods and the excellent Samsung Gear IconX for Android if you want to stay speciﬁc to the platform.However, if you want to stand out a bit, Jabra’s snazzy Elite 65T series is way better in both sound quality and ﬁt, they come in snazzy colours and models too. The gorgeous blue-and-gold Elite Active brings in motion detection and water resistance. The Elite Sport brings a better ﬁt for the rigours of working out.A little Tinder loving careNot down to holding hands? Treat yourself to a brand new phone, so you can download Tinder and get started. There are plenty of good aﬀordable phones out there. The OnePlus 6T has some incredible features and an ultra-fast 10GB RAM-equipped McLaren Edition to boost your swiping right.Huawei has got some incredible camera technology with its Mate 20 Pro’s 40 MP camera and its brand new Honor View 20’s unique colours and that same 40 MP camera, both tuned by Leica. iOS junkies can invest in the iPhone XS and XS Max or the iPhone XR which is slightly lower-end, but still good. If they’re too expensive — which they are — you could get a good deal on an iPhone X or 8 series.Size mattersIf you love the idea of curling up on the couch watching rom-coms, then why not treat yourself to a massive screen? Xiaomi has pretty good 4K 55-inch Mi TVs. If you want something bigger, there’s a 65-inch 4K from Vu.Now if you want to go bigger, then why not go for a projector? You can get a higher-end projector which gives 1080p and can project a larger than 75-inch image.Block out the hatersIf you peg Valentine’s Day as nothing but one big marketing ploy, then this gift for yourself could go against that very philosophy — but it’s worth every penny. One of the best noise-cancelling headphones on the market, the Sony 1000XM3 can blot out all those pesky Valentine’s Day noises so you can jam on your own tunes.They cost upwards of ₹30,000, but are packed with an incredible sound signature, extremely comfortable earpads and the noise-cancelling does not feel like you’re constantly coming down an elevator from the 100th ﬂoor. Just cup the earpiece and the music dims enough to hear what people are talking and then get back into your bubble. There are cheaper options for noise-cancelling; you can get Bose QuietComforts for a little less and TaoTronics and Cowin have budget noise-cancelling options."
Uighurs appeal to China to post videos of relatives in camps,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uighurs-to-china/article26246152.ece,"

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.“China, show us their videos if they are alive!” Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter. He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated 1 million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution.Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centers where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education. Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism.In a rare show of public criticism from a majority Muslim nation, Turkey on Saturday called China’s treatment of Uighurs “a great cause of shame for humanity.” Citing reports of Heyit’s death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the “concentration camps” and “systematic assimilation” to which Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang are subject.At a regular press briefing Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey’s statement “a very bad mistake.”The video shows Heyit in a gray sweater against a nondescript, gray wall. He states his name and gives the date as Feb. 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused.The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed.Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are unable to contact relatives still in Xinjiang . Fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive.The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media. On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings.If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

Writer stresses need for women to attain absolute freedom
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Noted fiction writer K.R. Meera has said the world over, women are among prime victims of mobocracy.Elections to the local bodies in Nagaland got stuck at women’s reservation issue for a very long time now as the tribal leaders of Nagaland took to the streets against reservation. But later it was found out that they were just using it as a red herring to avoid elections. The current plight of women of the politically-conscious Kerala is same as that of those Naga women, she said at the Krithi Knowledge Festival here on Monday.“In Kerala, as a child, instead of learning mathematics and science, I should have learnt thanthra samuchaya, naishtika brahmacharya, and the like,” she said, mockingly. “The lessons on history and civics we learnt as children have no value now as the present demand is for knowledge of the rituals around menstruation. Aren’t the mobocracy of the 16 types of tribes in Nagaland and the agitation on the streets of Kerala against the Supreme Court judgement similar?” she asked.Until women attain absolute freedom, mobocracy will not end. Unless they proclaim their citizenship, future generations they bring forth will also have to continue facing moral policing, sexual harassment and sex racketing, drug abuses, gang rapes, and communal riots. This is the emotional threat of mobocracy,” she said."

Double dose of feline love,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/double-dose-of-feline-love/article26242277.ece,"
A tale of how two kittens wormed their way into the Anil family’s hearts ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In an unusual twist of animal love, 33-year-old Ashwinii Anil always had an affinity for black cats. Unfortunately, most people consider black cats inauspicious, going so far as to use them in barbaric sacrificial rituals. In spite of her love for them, Anil was always cautious about adopting a pet. With two young kids: a mildly autistic six-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter, the single mum hardly had any time. Still, she’d do her part for animal-kind and rescue injured street animals, treat them and get them adopted or release them in their place.For years, Anil continued with the practice, until she encountered a tiny ginger kitten. Found all alone in a garden, he was emaciated with an abscess. Anil immediately knew what she had to do. “I didn’t have any intention of keeping him,” she says. “Somebody had abandoned him because he knew how to use the litter box.” Surprisingly, the kitten now named Michan (after a character on the show Doraemon) fit right in with Anil’s family, abating all her wariness of keeping pets. Even though she had Michan, the mother-of-two still desired a black kitten. As if the stars aligned, a few days after Michan was officially adopted by Anil, she saw a post for Kali. “She was only 45 days old and Michan was three months old,” says Anil. “She was tiny but powerful and fierce.”Initially, all was not well in the household when the two met. Michan and Kali fought tooth and nail for a whole week. “Now Michan is not interested in us at all and only wants to play with Kali,” laughs Anil. Both her kids too, have become attached to the kittens, extremely entertained with the duo’s mischievous ways.Kali is very graceful, independent and “likes to play by herself the whole day,” says Anil. “But at night she has to sleep in my blanket.” On the other hand, Michan, like most ginger cats, is rambunctious and loves to trouble his feline sibling. “He used to be so attached to me before Kali,” says Anil wistfully but concedes that together the two cats are a riot."

We have been denied what was rightfully ours,” he claimed.A TDP delegation led by Naidu will submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday, party sources said.PTI"

Anne-Claire Lévêque and Emilie Camatte are working towards bringing out a book of French idioms with contributions from French students at Alliance Française
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Stooped over a sheaf of colourful papers — vigorously scrubbing, rewriting and cross-checking — is a motley group of French language enthusiasts. They are constructing French idioms through illustrations. Writer and freelance journalist, Anne-Claire Lévêque and illustrator and artist, Emilie Camatte, stand by, observing and occasionally throwing suggestions to the eager students. It’s a riot of paints, colour pencils, papers and references at the Alliance Française of Madras library on a Friday afternoon. This is a step towards bringing out a book of idioms, compiling all the contributions from the various centres at the end of their tour in India, in association with Alliance Française.“The idea is to integrate French expressions and their meanings, to learn about them,” says the duo, adding laughingly that they are running on four hours of sleep and might not be coherent enough. I ask about the full-day workshop: While Anne-Claire suggests creating conversations through the idioms, Emilie recreates the expressions through simple motifs. As they whip out pieces of paper, replete with illustrations that compliment the expressions, they tell me, that it is their first collaborative effort. Between broken English and generous droppings of unfamiliar French words, they begin to tell me their stories.Emilie has been to India almost four times now. And so, it is only justified that her illustrations draw from Indian aesthetics — the culture, ‘crowd’ (as she puts it), colours and fabrics. Though none of her books are available in translation in India, her content oscillates widely between documentation and imagination. She says, “I am drawing parts from what I see in my mind. Most often these are stories within a story,” adding, “always inspired by reality”. Emilie currently has four works that are heavily inspired by India. “People here, keep their senses open. I had gone to Rajasthan and was overwhelmed by the colours and fabrics they use,” she says, recalling the time when trains fascinated her, with its crowded compartments and vendors shouting ‘chai, chai, chai’— a collage of stories. She also collects the fabrics which later make appearances in the books.Anne-Claire, on the other hand, used to “breathe books” from childhood. But after an illustrious career as a freelance journalist, she decided to venture into writing children’s’ books. She prefers writing fiction over reportage, any day. “I still live in my childhood imagination. Kids have a big world of possibilities, when you are an adult this world shrinks,” she observes, adding that like children, she too tends to see situations from different perspectives. Her writing, does not take refuge in the magical and supernatural. Rather, she looks at everyday life situations and finds a narrative in it. Her first book which was published in 1998Attention ala marchel(Watch Your Step!), was born out of her observation of people dancing at a party. Their body movements spurred her into a weaving a story. She adds, “For me, words matter the most. The sound of words and the way they look on paper inspire me.”Before they take leave, Emilie quickly lets me run my eyes through her book,Niranjana veut aller à l'école(Niranjana wants to go to School). The patterns and colours are familiar. I spot turbans, curtains and clothes. The faces too, are familiar. As they leave for Puducherry for their next session, Anne-Claire says, “The responses were great from all around India.

Modi will be taught a lesson if he made personal attacks against the people of Andhra Pradesh, said the Chief Minister ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"All the major Opposition parties on Monday converged at Andhra Bhawan, where Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu along with all his legislators, MPs and Ministers sat down on a 12-hour fast protesting against the Narendra Modi government’s failure to deliver the promised special status to the State. This was the second time the Opposition got together in a month.The last such gathering was at a rally by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata protesting against the CBI’s alleged misconduct.Left skip eventThe CPI and the CPI (M) skipped the event since they are part of the Pawan Kalyan-led front against the TDP in Andhra Pradesh.Opening the day-long protest for justice, Mr. Naidu said Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not follow “raj dharma.” “Atal Bihari Vajpayee said ‘raj dharma’ was not followed in Gujarat (during the 2002 riots). Now, raj dharma is not being followed in the case of Andhra Pradesh. We have been denied what was rightfully ours,” he said.The Andhra CM alleged that Mr. Modi was “unfit” to rule the country and that he went to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh “only to rub salt into our wounds.”“On behalf of five crore people of Andhra, I am warning this government... I came here to remind you of the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act,” he said.Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was one of the first Opposition leaders to visit the fast venue, said the Prime Minister had made a habit of lying on the special status. “He goes to Andhra Pradesh, he lies about the special status. He goes to the North-East, he tells another lie over there. He has absolutely got no credibility left,” Mr. Gandhi said.Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said the No-Confidence Motion moved by the TDP had brought the Opposition together. “This is not a fight of any one political party, it is not a fight of the TDP or TMC alone. This is a fight to save the Constitution, to save secularism and to save the nation,” he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “One may have voted for any party but after elections, whoever wins and becomes the CM, is the CM of the entire State and not of a particular party. Similarly, when one becomes the PM, then he is the PM of the entire country, not just one party. The way PM Modi treats governments of Opposition parties in States, he behaves like he is not the PM of India but the PM of Pakistan.”Mr. Naidu was seen showing the clippings of his exchanges with Mr. Modi in Andhra Pradesh to all the political leaders who came. National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said the Prime Minister had stooped so low as to make personal remarks against Mr. Naidu. “The Jammu-Srinagar highway is closed for six days. They cannot clear the 30km road, but they want to rule the country,” he added.Just cause, says DMKStating that Mr. Naidu was fighting for a just cause, DMK leader Siva said the Modi government would be ousted in three months. He also reminded the gathering that Mr. Naidu had played a vital role in the earlier coalition governments. “The powers of the State are being encroached upon,” he said.Loktantrik Janata Dal chief Sharad Yadav said the Modi-Shah claim that the Opposition has no prime ministerial face is grounded in ignorance. “In 1996 or 1989 we did not have any prime ministerial face and yet we managed to win the election and find a credible candidate,” he added.Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Ahmed Patel and Jairam Ramesh were also at the venue to express their support. Among others who met Mr. Naidu were former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, NCP’s Majeed Memon, JD (S) chief Deve Gowda, Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and BJP rebel Shatrughan Sinha.On Tuesday, Mr. Naidu, along with ministers, MPs and legislators, will march from Andhra Bhawan to Jantar Mantar before meeting President of India Ram Nath Kovind at noon."

Caught between two extremisms,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/caught-between-two-extremisms/article26231338.ece,"
Wahhabi influence and Hindu nationalism are responsible for the radicalisation of a small segment of Muslim youth ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"News reports about occasional acts of terrorism outside of Jammu and Kashmir, which for historical reasons forms a special case, attributed to young Indian Muslims have appeared intermittently in the press. In addition, several recent reports suggest that global jihadi organisations such as the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) have recruited a few Indian Muslim youth primarily by exploiting the latter’s local grievances to serve their own global goals.Many analysts, Indian and foreign, had assumed until recently that Indian Muslims were immune to extremist propaganda because of both the syncretic and moderate nature of Indian Islam and the democratic and secular character of the country which made them feel they were equal participants in the political process. Both these assumptions are now problematic, as several factors have been at work in the past three decades that challenge this conventional wisdom.Wahhabi influenceThe first is the increasing influence of Saudi Wahhabism and related forms of Salafism on Islam as practised in the Indian subcontinent. This is the result of several inter-related variables but the most important of these is the vast increase in employment opportunities in the energy-rich West Asian countries following the oil boom of the 1970s. This resulted in many Indians of all faiths temporarily locating to these countries in search of higher earnings. While a much larger number of Indians belonging to other religions moved to West Asia in search of lucrative jobs, both white and blue-collar, the religio-cultural impact of the encounter with the fundamentalist form of Islam followed in these countries, especially Saudi Arabia, on a section of Indian Muslim emigrants was qualitatively different.Several of these temporary migrants returned to India enamoured with the obscurantist ethos of these oil-rich countries. This fascination was publicly exhibited above all in the adoption by a section of Muslim women, often under patriarchal pressure, of an ultraconservative dress code, including the niqab, or full face covering, popular in Saudi Arabia and some other West Asian countries. This dress code is very different from the traditional concept of purdah (covering up or modesty) practised by conservative Muslim families in the Indian subcontinent.Protected by SufismBut this display of presumed orthodoxy constituted merely the tip of the iceberg. The impact of Wahhabi/Salafi Islam on the mindset of a segment of returnees, who also passed on their preferences to a much larger group of relatives and acquaintances already impressed by the former’s newly acquired prosperity, was more profound. Islamic beliefs and practices among some Indian Muslims began to approximate the harsh Wahhabi dogma, which stands in stark contrast to the indigenous version of Islam in India. The vast majority of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent belong to the Hanafi sect based on the most liberal school of Islamic jurisprudence.Moreover, traditionally Indian Islam has been greatly influenced by Sufi teachings and is, therefore, tolerant and accepting of religious diversity. Visitors to major Sufi shrines, such as those of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer and Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi, where people of all confessions come to pray and seek blessings, can testify to the syncretic spirit of Indian Islam. Consequently, it harbours natural defences against extremism in belief and practice. The ideological infiltration of Wahhabism/Salafism has eroded some of these defences and made a section of Muslims more insular and, therefore, open to extremist ideas.Equally important, the spectacular rise of Hindutva or Hindu nationalism from the 1990s has had a major psychological impact on a section of Muslim youth, prompting their estrangement from the national mainstream. Inter-religious riots in which Muslims suffered disproportionately had been common in India since Independence. In some cases the police killed Muslim youth in fake encounters. The Hashimpura massacre in Uttar Pradesh by members of the Provincial Armed Constabulary in 1987 was the most macabre example of such incidents.However, until the 1990s the vast majority of Indian Muslims treated such occurrences as aberrations and their belief in the secular and non-discriminatory character of the Indian state remained unshaken. The demolition in 1992 of the Babri mosque by a Hindu mob under the direction of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) luminaries and the riots that ensued, in which scores of Muslims lost their lives, shook the confidence of many Muslims in the secular character of the Indian state. What was most galling was the Central government’s apathy in the face of this brazen act of mob violence despite the fact that it had been forewarned. This event began the process of alienation among a section of Muslim youth from the Indian state.This feeling grew exponentially a decade later in 2002 with the massacre of about 1,000 Muslims in Gujarat under BJP rule to avenge the death of 59 kar sevaks who were burnt to death in a train at Godhra after an altercation with local Muslims. What added insult to injury was the inaction, or, as the Human Rights Watch report on the bloodbath put it, the refusal of the state machinery to protect Muslim citizens.More recently, the disenchantment caused by these earlier events has been reinforced by the lynching of several Muslims in northern and central India on the pretext that they were taking cows for slaughter or eating beef. The lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri, in western Uttar Pradesh, in 2015 on suspicion that he had stored beef in his house was the most chilling example of such incidents. It was followed by additional acts of mob violence carried out with relative impunity by the so-called gau rakshak (cow protector) vigilantes. Such incidents have led to a widespread feeling among Indian Muslims that the state, instead of providing security to them, now colludes with those determined to intimidate them into submission. This series of actions and reactions makes it evident that the growth of Hindu nationalism has acted as a major stimulus for the radicalisation of a section of Muslim society in India and that the two phenomena feed off each other.Onus on governing elitesOpinion leaders and religious scholars from within the Muslim community have the primary duty to confront and defeat the malign Wahhabi-Salafi influence on Indian Muslims in order to preserve the liberal and syncretic nature of Indian Islam thus pre-empting the spread of extremist ideology among Muslim youth. However, the impact of the growth of Hindu nationalism on the Muslim psyche can be countered only by the policies and actions of the governing elites at the Centre and in the States. Only they can take concrete steps, such as quick and impartial action against those responsible for creating mayhem in the name of religion, to reassure Muslims that the state will not shirk its responsibility of providing them physical security and ensuring that they are treated with fairness and dignity. This will be the best antidote to the percolation of radical ideas among Muslim youth by removing their sense of alienation from the Indian state that in the long run can threaten the country’s security.Mohammed Ayoob is University Distinguished Professor Emeritus of International Relations, Michigan State University and Non-Resident Senior Fellow, Center for Global Policy, Washington DC"

"For tourists, India a ‘chaos’ they love to explore",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/for-tourists-india-a-chaos-they-love-to-explore/article26232047.ece,"
Most visitors don't buy the stereotypes about the country, but they do remain wary of touts and strangers
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With the rising number of travel vloggers visiting India, relaying “10 things that blew their minds”, another 10 that they “hated” and everything in between, tourists visiting the country now have a lot more information to access before starting on their journey. And while no two people have the same experience, for those visiting Delhi, especially for the first time, a cultural shock is almost inevitable.“It’s Chaotic,” exclaimed Fie, from Berlin, who is on her first trip to India, along with a group of friends.“In Europe there are rules. Things are ordered. Here, people do whatever they want. You would never see a car moving in the wrong direction or people crossing the street like this there,” she said. Ani from Albania, who has been in the country only for a week, said: “I feel like I have been travelling for a year and have seen 20 cities. There’s so much here, it’s like everything is rolled up into one.”For a Caucasian in India, getting stared at on the streets is a given, but now strangers walking up to them to take selfies is also a regular affair. Boris, also from Berlin, said that he gets approached by at least two people everyday who want to click a selfie with him. “But it’s more like they are curious, not aggressive,” he added.Commenting on the selfie requests, Losha from St. Petersburg said: “It’s funny, it’s not like they even want to have a conversation. They just take a picture and leave.”Safety concernsSeveral tourists said they had been warned about safety issues, women getting raped and tourists being scammed, before visiting the countryBut as Ani put it, “There are similar stereotypes about my country too, but I don’t think they are true. It has more to do with being careful and depends on the situation.”However, scams are a problem, said drivers of tourist cabs parked on Janpath Road, where several luxury hotels are located. “You won’t believe the amount of fraud that takes place on this road,” said Sukhbir, a cab driver. “They have a system where the touts tie up with auto drivers. They tell them [tourists] that there are riots happening up ahead and it’s not safe to travel there. They then trick people into going to hotels and shops they are associated with.”He also claimed that the police are hand in glove with the touts. “They (touts) have gone underground now because of some recent incident but they’ll be back soon,” he said. “It kills our business, but more than that it brings the country a bad name,” he added.Fake toursJustyana from Poland said things like being taken on a fake tour or hotels not turning out to be what they promise is common, but she's cautious enough not to give out personal information.“They are always asking for your details about where you are staying and things like that and trying to tell you that they will take you to a better place.”Touts can be persistent, said Antti from Finland.“They have an odd way of trying to sell things to you. They don’t get to the point immediately. They will try to engage you in a conversation, get information and then after a while tell you ‘oh you should come to my friend’s hotel or my brother’s store’. In Jaipur we encountered one guy who did this and kept walking with us for the longest time even after we said no,” he said.Most people are not too bothered by street vendors.“We just ignore them and keep walking. But it’s hard to say no to kids,” said Justyana.“But even with these things, like charging extra for a rickshaw ride, or hotel or some street items, it’s not so expensive and it’s not such a big deal,” she added.Learning experienceThe more time spent travelling, however, helps you navigate the country better. For instance, Yaov Ben Zaken, an Israeli tour guide who’s been bringing tourists to the country for several years now, is friends with the street merchants selling cheap necklaces and wallets near the art and craft emporiums on Janpath Road.“These people aren’t really scamming anyone. They’re just trying to make a little money to feed their children and live their lives,” he said. Zaken has travelled the world and his constant advice to tourists is to not be judgmental “...About the smell, the clothes, the poverty. Visit a new place, experience its culture, you will learn something.”"

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Turkey has called China’s treatment of its minority Uighurs “a great cause of shame for humanity.”In a statement on Saturday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said it’s “no longer a secret” that China has arbitrarily detained more than a million Uighurs in “concentration camps.” He said the Turkic Muslim population faced pressure and “systematic assimilation” in western China.Mr. Aksoy said Turkey has shared with China its position on “all levels” and urged authorities to close the detention facilities and respect human rights.The minister said Turkey had also learned of the death in prison of famed Uighur musician and poet Abdurehim Heyit, who had been sentenced to eight years over one of his songs.“This tragedy has further reinforced the reaction of the Turkish public opinion toward serious human rights violations committed in the Xinjiang region,” Mr. Aksoy said.“We expect this legitimate response to be taken into account by the Chinese authorities. We respectfully commemorate Abdurehim Heyit and all our kinsmen who lost their lives defending their Turkish and Muslim identity,” Mr. Aksoy said.Beijing has intensified a security clampdown on Uighurs in the northwestern region of Xinjiang that was put in place after a bloody 2009 riot.

Old Rajender Nagar, in the Central part of Delhi, is a riot of food choices, keeping in mind the young population that thrives on books and hope
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"There are some signs that tell you what’s in store for you. 1) If there are dark clouds, there will be rain. 2) If there are ants, there will be sugar around. 3) If there are groups of students, there will be good food. While 1) and 2) may or may not be true all the time, 3) is a fact.The best example of this is Delhi University, an area which is now bursting at the seams with restaurants. You get all kinds of food there, from Naga and Assamese to Tibetan and Korean to American and Italian. Even Jawaharlal Nehru University is surrounded by several big and small eateries. And if you are in Old Rajender Nagar, you will find a whole new township of students — and a spate of restaurants.I was there last week — with an old friend, Raj — and thought I should try out one of the eateries that I had been hearing about. A part of Old Rajender Nagar is a hub of students — young men and women seeking to sit for the civil-service examinations. There are coaching centres all around, and students from across the country have taken rooms here. Eateries that serve regional food have sprung up in a market square next to the residential area, which is also the main market area.Old Rajender Nagar is on the right of Shankar Road if you are coming in from Connaught Place. I went there some months ago and had good Maharashtrian food at a place called Marathi Katta. This time, I wanted to try out an eatery called The Canteen. But it turned out that it had downed its shutters, so we went looking for other eateries, and came across Sri Annapurna, which serves Andhra cuisine.This is the place you should visit if you like your food hot. We saw the menu card and decided to get our lunch packed. I asked for a plate of tamarind rice (Rs. 90), two of upma (Rs. 60 a plate), one plate of chicken fry (Rs. 190) and another of chicken curry (Rs. 170 for half a plate). While the food was being readied, we shared a masala dosa (Rs. 80). The potato sabzi in the dosa was light but delicious, and the dosa itself was soft at the centre and crispy at the edges. Excellent.The young man at the counter urged us to wait for the chicken biryani, which had just been placed on the stove. But that was going to take another 30 or 40 minutes, so we reluctantly left without trying out the Andhra dum biryani (Rs. 150).We carried the lunch back home — and I must say I enjoyed the meal. The tamarind rice was nice and tart, and the chicken fry was hot and spicy. I enjoyed the thick gravy of the chicken curry, flavoured with onions and tamarind. I liked the upma, too, which was neither too oily, nor too dry. It had bits of peanuts in it, which added to the taste.I was right: Where there are students, you are bound to find food. Go try out Old Rajender Nagar. It’s young and vibrant, just like its residents."

Anuvab Pal lights up proceedings, finding comedy in diversity
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In order to find out what we want to know, perhaps the first question to ask is who we really are. Wrapping up the day’s events at The Huddle, in a show titled “Does the Nation Want to Know?,” comedian and writer Anuvab Pal first gathered the giggles by exploring the intricacies of how each region in the country behaves.“I am Bengali and we are not the bravest people in the country,” he began. “If someone threatened to elope with my wife, I’d have to go and scare him with a poem.”Runs riotMr. Pal ran riot through each State and the idiosyncrasies of the people there, although the fact that people in south India seem to understand and speak English well seemed to impress him immensely. (“When Lord Wellesley came to south India and yelled, ‘surrender,’ everyone applauded. At last, someone who speaks English! And while we are in the region, here’s another one, “Vasco da Gama went to Kerala, got an Ayurvedic massage and never left.” One last: “I performed in Kashmir last week. Everyone there is so good looking. No wonder they want to separate.”)Mr. Pal also held up a mirror to the state of journalism in India, especially in the form it plays out at prime time on television screens, where shouting anchors and tired talking heads play out a charade of a debate night after night, with not much real accomplishment other than constantly stirring the communal pot. He traced part of this, comically, to the origin of the construct of the term ‘Lutyens media’, which is often deployed to indicate a cabal of journalists and politicians who hobnob and trade favours in central Delhi, and the obsession with the actual residents of Lutyens Delhi in claiming London as their own and sounding ‘propahly’ English.The central point of Mr. Pal’s comedy is an honest look at ourselves, a diverse people now struggling with the issue of national identity, and baffled at how we got here in the first place. Class and linguistic constructs used to be structured. Now, who knows what’s going on?‘Does the Nation Want to Know?’ the show asks. In its inability to answer that lies the real question. Does the Nation Know?"

Bombay hip-hop goes mainstream,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bombay-hip-hop-goes-mainstream/article26218801.ece,"
From text battles on Orkut to Zoya Akhtar’s Gully Boy, Divine and Naezy get a taste of Bollywood ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"For the first four years of his career, ‘Gully boy’ rapper, Divine aka Vivian Fernandes would only spit rhymes in English. As a young kid with access to only to Western hip-hop, the now 28-year-old didn’t realise Hindi was a viable option. “I must have made 25 songs and released about ten, but the maximum [views] I got were about 10,000,” says Divine whose earnestness belies the swag he sports on stage. Today, the J.B Nagar Catholic boy’s YouTube channel has more than 8,00,000 subscribers. He’s released music with T-Series, Sony and Zee Music. He’s also provided music for films likeBlackmail,Mukkabaazand Netflix showSacred Games. Now, Divine has formed his own company Gully Gang Entertainment with his own record label. “I rapped in English but I thought in Hindi,” he gently chuckles. “My listeners were very different from the scene before but now the whole scene listens to us.”The scene in question is the circle of music fiends who happily devoured jacked-up drinks at Mumbai’s swish bars. They’re that elite person (read: flower child/ hipster) in search of a new cool fix. This not-quite-melting-pot was stirred after Divine’s 2013 hit‘Yeh Mera Bombay’. Then, a year later came Naezy’s ‘Aafat!’. “We started relating to everyone, whether it’s a businessman, rickshaw driver, hawker or actor,” says Divine. “That’s the beauty of Mumbai, a local guy and actor will both have to drive on same road.” It’s also why there’s been a proliferation of multi-language hip-hop artistes, more than any other music genre. The barrier for entry into hip-hop is lower according to rapper A-List aka Ashwini Mishra who’s been a pioneer of Indian hip-hop. “You didn’t need to move in certain circles or get entry to fancy clubs,” says A-List. “The circle of rappers was fairly mixed in class and caste. It’s not the same rich middle-class kids that form part of the [music] scene.”Surf and turfLong before Ranveer Singh was jumping off stages injuring unsuspecting spectators to promoteGully Boy, hip-hop in India had virtual beginnings. Although, MTV introduced the genre to a nation of starved music lovers in the 90s, there were few artistes like Baba Sehgal, Style Bhai and Blaaze who experimented with desi hop-hop. Legit MCs (master of ceremonies or mic controllers) from around the country were battling on Orkut in a group called Insignia (also called Pathshala). The Pathshala, featured Rap Combats (subgroups) on texts, audio and even had a database of contacts. Today’s underground MCs are mostly those Insignia alumni taking hip-hop forward. “They’d write a verse and it was just reading and then they had audio battles, people dissing each other with lyrics,” says 26-year-old Ankur Johar aka Enkore who was active on Insignia along with Divine. “Simultaneously, clubs in the city were having hip-hop nights but there were hardly any MCs.” Artistes like Big Silly, Raja Mukherjee, Vineet Nair (Poetik Justice), Lester Cardoz (Kav-E), DJ Ishani, DJ BobKat are veterans. “Unfortunately [they] ended up in high-brow places and a lot of the artistes ended up having to look more elite,” says Enkore who’s recently released his second albumBombay Soul.But it was evident that hip-hop had sunk its claws into willing music lovers. Even 50 Cent at the height of his career performed in Mumbai in November 2007. It was during a time only washed-up international musicians passed through the country in a bid to stay relevant. Some time later “Bombay Bassment took the indie scene by storm as India’s first ever hip-hop band,” remembers Ishani Majumdar, one of the first DJs (as DJ Ishani) to host hip-hop nights in the city.After the noughties, freestyle rap cyphers started mushrooming in a spots like Dadar’s Narali Baug, Sion Fort, hookah parlours and random joints all over the city. Upscale clubs like Royalty too were playing hip-hop in Bandra, although these places were less accessible to most. “We met on a weekly basis and the idea was to create a space where it wasn’t about performances but working on the craft,” says A-List who used to host Cypher Mania for freestyle rapping. “The problem with hip-hop in Mumbai is you didn’t know whether you sucked or not. Even if you were the worst, you still rapped and that community was very crucial,” he adds. Soon dedicated freestyle rap (cypher) nights were established. For instance, event company Culture Shoq’s open mic nights were initially aimed at comedy and poetry. “But then us rappers started filling up all the spots,” laughs Enkore.Gone with the filmWithGully Boyhip-hop is front and centre in a Bollywood film, but it’s not the first time the two have intersected. Yo Yo Honey Singh, Bohemia, Raftaar, Badshah have been the conveyor belt to fuel Hindi films’ obsession with club hits. As Zoya Akhtar steers away from her brand of cinema (a la riches to rags), Bollywood awakens to a different kind of hip-hop. “From a music point of view, Bollywood is validating our music, they are recognising our music,” says Naezy aka Naved Sheikh who along with Divine are the inspiration for the upcoming film. “Now the masses too will also listen to our music.”A hip-hop veteran like A-List too considers the merging favourable saying it offers a lot of financial opportunities to rappers. “Hip-hop is not a monolith. Authenticity, doesn’t have to mean one kind of Indian hip-hop,” he says. “If you rap, you’re a real rapper.” Though, Divine appreciatesGully Boy, he understands that the film industry has latched onto something ‘cool’. “I don’t have that much faith in Bollywood. It’s great that hip-hop is in the mainstream, but we shouldn’t depend on it,” he says. “The Internet made guys like me and I think making good music should be the goal, not Bollywood.”Others are more sceptical. Soon after videos ofGully Boy’s launch were out, Enkore took to social media to voice his displeasure. He rapped, “Bollywood scripts ne palte poore biopics aur culture ko diyaRock On/Samjho yeh strategy, entertainment yeh, na koi documentary/Aur scripted hip-hop kabhi asli nahi. He explains his stance, “I don’t think Bollywood is damaging hip-hop but it’s diluting it. It is the voice of the streets and it’s that voice for us.”It’s a sentiment that has resonated with every artiste interviewed for this feature. Hip-hop is the voice of the people and it’s here to stay. Most artistes have been hustling to pursue their passion and they don’t plan to stop any time soon. “The indie music scene in general is going through a rough patch right now, limited performance spaces and dwindling crowds,” says Ishani. “Indie hip-hop artistes will adjust to the new dynamics and continue to be a force in this Bollywood-addicted city.”Make some NaezyIt was some time after the 1992 riots in the city when Kurla was under close scrutiny by the police. “Many people were killed in encounters and it had become hard to get your hands on guns,” remembers Naved Sheikh aka Naezy (a portmanteau of Naved and Noisy) who easily embodies the cool grace he sports in performances. Dressed simply in sweats and T-shirt, he’s bemoaning a mouth ulcer. But it does nothing to stop the gush of conversation. “People use knives now,” he says seriously. The 26-year-old rapper is talking about his childhood where he lived with ten people in a 10x10 house. The “chota criminal” as he calls himself, distinctly remembers how at 14, he heard Sean Paul’s ‘Temperature’ at a neighbourhood function. Hip-hop soon became an escape not just from what was happening outside but also inside for Naezy. With little access to TV and the Internet, Naezy would go to cyber cafés and print out lyrics of songs. He’d meticulously pour over them learning to spit rhymes. After the 2014 viral hit ‘Aafat’, the rapper brought Indian hip-hop to the fore. His latest song,‘Asal Hustle’(which released two years ago) has 12,51,950 views. “I don’t like the term gully rap, it’s what people have started calling it,” he laughs. “I’d prefer Bombay hip-hop. If we come from Bombay we need to represent our life and our genre, we are more than just gullies.”Naezy’s famously declared he couldn’t possibly rap about ‘bottles of vodka’, because he couldn’t afford one, let alone four. Instead, he prefers to talk about his life, even if it’s about the less-than-rosy things Mumbai has to offer. “Even if I have money, I won’t talk about it. There are two kinds of rappers in the industry, those who talk about the truth and others who just show off. But I think there’s space for everyone. I want to talk about socio-political issues.” In a soon-to-be-released song, the rapper dissects the relationship between a roadside thug and a police ‘mama’. “I will ask them tumhara duty kya hai, sirf paisa leta hai kya?As a child, Naezy impressed the kids in his hood with export quality clothes he’d scoured Colaba and Fashion Street for. Today, he only wears Adidas. “The brands that I used to buy copies of want to style me exclusively,” he smiles with a touch of pride. Things have certainly changed, but Naezy can’t forget his roots. His family still wants him to study further (he’s got a Bachelor’s in Science). Even a Bollywood life inspired by his life won’t impress his family. “Gully Boyis just another project to them,” he says. “But hip-hop is my life.”"

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It turned out to be a good toss to lose for England Lions. Put in by India-A captain Ankeet Bawane, the visitors batted with flair and determination to make 303 for five on day one of the first unofficial Test at the Wayanad Cricket Stadium on Thursday.Opener Ben Duckett is the man responsible for that healthy score, but he didn’t seem particularly happy when he met reporters after stumps. For, he was out for 80 (118b, 15x4) when he looked set for a century. Sam Hain was the other main scorer, with 61.Those two weren’t the only batsmen to frustrate the home bowlers. Steven Mullaney (39 batting) and Will Jacks (40 batting) have so far added 65 for the unfinished sixth wicket to ensure the Lions had the upper hand on the opening day.Batsmen dominateIt was the first time in the last three First Class matches on this ground that the batsmen could dominate. Seamers had run riot in Kerala’s quarterfinal and semifinal encounters last month.And that could have been a reason for the host’s decision to bowl first. But, the wicket for this match has less grass and even a different soil has been used. The conditions were far less cold, too.Lions were given a bright start by Duckett and Max Holden (26), the two adding 82 before Navdeep Saini broke the partnership. The Delhi seamer had Holden edging to K.S. Bharat behind the stumps.That brought Hain to the wicket and he too gave ample support to Duckett as the duo added 48 for the second wicket. The opener, who had guided Lions to their only win on the tour with an unbeaten 70 in the final one-dayer at Thiruvananthapuram, was in lovely touch.He played some sweetly-timed strokes through the off-side and was promising more, until he was bowled by a ball that came in slightly from Shardul Thakur. “I was hoping to get a hundred after doing all the hard work, and it is a shame I couldn’t,” Duckett said. “I hope I get another chance to bat in the second innings.”Ollie Pope and skipper Sam Billings too would have to wait till the second innings to make an impact in the match; neither could reach double figures.As for India-A’s bowling, it wasn’t very disciplined. Saini was the pick, while Avesh Khan caught the eye with his pace.The scores:England Lions — 1st innings: Max Holden c Bharat b Saini 26, Ben Duckett b Shardul 80, Sam Hain c Bharat b Saxena 61, Ollie Pope b Avesh 8, Sam Billings c Bharat b Saini 9, Steven Mullaney (batting) 39, Will Jacks (batting) 40, Extras (b-12, lb-21, nb-4, w-3) 40; Total (for five wkts. in 90 overs): 303.Fall of wickets: 1-82, 2-130, 3-162, 4-201, 5-238India-A bowling: Shardul 18-1-62-1, Saini 16-3-57-2, Avesh 12-3-35-1, Saxena 17-3-49-1, Shahbaz 25-5-59-0, Panchal 2-0-8-0.Toss: India-A

After graduating, our group of friends went in different directions and I didn’t perform mimes any more,” recalls Praveen Kumar. “But, I always wanted to do something related to comedy,” he adds, “and so I got married.”Be ready for more such quips at Praveen’s stand up comedy show Mr Family Man. The 85-minute performance has an opening act followed by non-stop laugh riot, promises Praveen. “The show was launched last November and so far I have performed it in Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kochi, Coimbatore and Tiruchi and I am coming to Madurai for the first time. The second round of shows will be at Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai and Hong Kong.”Written in both Tamil and English, the show is about how a ‘family man’ is also a superhero like Batman or Superman. “Especially because of the challenges he faces everyday, from the kind of responsibilities he manages to the relationships he maintains with not just friends and relatives but also with the driver, plumber or the carpenter. So it’s basically a comical take on his daily struggles,” says the 37-year-old family man. “Much of it is from my personal experience. For instance, I will talk about what I did when a rat entered our kitchen or what happened when I took my wife for shopping. That will make it relatable to everyone.”A Kanchipuram boy, now based in Bengaluru, Praveen has been a stand up comedian for nearly 10 years now. “I make sure that my shows are clean comedies. Adult jokes don’t excite me any more. And since I want families to enjoy my shows, I steer clear of anything that can embarrass parents and children in each other’s company,” he says.Organised by Evam and Eight-O-Eight, the show will be in Tamil, on February 10, 6 pm at JC Residency, Chinna Chokkikulam.

Matter has been posted for hearing on February 28 to allow Delhi Police to secure prosecution sanction ",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A Delhi court on Wednesday pulled up the authorities in question for sitting on a Delhi police request for prosecution sanction against former JNU students’ union president Kanhaiya Kumar and others in a 2016 sedition case.‘Sit on its hands’“After filing of the chargesheet, no department can sit on its hands with the file with regard to the sanction. The department concerned can do well to speed up the matter regarding the sanction,” Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Deepak Sherawat said when the police informed him that the sanction had not been granted to date.“The chargesheet was filed without first obtaining the requisite sanction under Section 196 of Criminal Procedure Code and adjournments are being sought on the grounds that the process relating to obtaining of sanction is under way. The precious time of the court is being wasted as the decision with regard to the grant of sanction hangs fire,” said Mr. Sherawat.Later, allowing the probe agency’s plea for more time to file the sanction, the magistrate posted the matter for February 28.The magistrate had on January 19 refused to take cognisance of the chargesheet, stating that the Delhi police filed it without sanction for prosecution. The police had then promised to get the required sanction within 10 days.According to Section 196 of the CrPC, “No court shall take cognisance of any offence punishable under Chapter VI of the Indian Penal Code.” Section 124-A (sedition) of the IPC, under which the accused have been chargesheeted, is placed under this chapter.The case relates to alleged shouting of anti-India slogans on JNU campus in February 2016.Those chargesheeted in the case include Mr. Kumar, former JNU students Syed Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya — under Sections 124A (sedition), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 465 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine, forged document), 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly, 149 (unlawful assembly with common object), 147 (rioting) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code."

Party backs police action against activist and academician Anand Teltumbde
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Shiv Sena on Wednesday backed police action against activist and academician Anand Teltumbde, and sought to draw a parallel between those linked to the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune and the Al-Qaeda terror outfit.The party said that constant attacks on the police, administration and law, raising doubts over the State government and demoralising people was the strategy adopted by the Al-Qaeda. “People supporting Elgar Parishad also have a similar strategy,” the Sena said in an editorial published in its mouthpieceSaamana.“Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar dubbed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) a terrorist body, but it is a radical nationalist organisation,” the Sena said. Mr. Teltumbde, who the police claim has Maoist links, is an accused in the Bhima-Koregaon case registered by the Pune police. The case was filed following violent clashes at Bhima-Koregaon village near Pune district on January 1, 2018. The activist was arrested last week in the case and released following a sessions court order. He was booked following the Elgar Parishad on December 31, 2017, which, the police alleged, triggered clashes the next day at Bhima-Koregaon.According to the police, the event was funded and supported by the Maoists. The Sena said, “The Bhima-Koregaon riots, where Dalits were attacked, has caused a vertical split in society. Sowing the seeds of rebellion, creating and spreading such literature and raising funds for it is the actual work of Maoist intellectuals. Al-Qaeda and intellectuals linked to the Elgar Parishad have a similar style of functioning.”‘Anti-national activities’The editorial said people facing criminal charges such as murder, corruption and massacre get acquitted at times, which does not necessarily mean they are innocent, and Mr. Teltumbde’s supporters should know this. The Sena claimed some serious “anti-national activities” were being planned, and portraying police as criminals was the beginning of such a conspiracy. “Hence, this is the right time to stand firmly with police,” it said.It also objected to the term ‘Dalit academic’ used to refer to Mr. Teltumbde, saying it was an insult to tag caste with a person’s intelligence. “People having a soft corner towards the Naxal movement cooked up the plan to spew venom of casteism in Maharashtra,” the editorial said.It added that “bogus intellectuals” reacted to the action against Mr. Teltumbde and other intellectuals like Varavara Rao, Arun Perreira, Vernon Gonsalves and Sudha Bhardwaj as if the “sky was falling“.The court offered them, including Mr. Teltumbde, some respite, but does it mean police should not do anything, wondered the Sena. “The police have presented proof of their [activists] speeches and venom-spewing literature. All these people were key persons to destabilise the country,” the Sena alleged.Their high academic qualifications have offered them prestige and contacts in the fields of administration, law and judiciary and education sectors, it said. “These people have used such a network to spread the destructive thoughts of Naxalites and Maoism,” it said.In a way, these people are “sponsors or preachers of terrorism”, the party said, adding that intellectuals also need to abide by law."

",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Senior leaders of several Left parties on Sunday came together at the Brigade Parade Grounds here on Sunday, and called for the removal of the BJP government at the Centre and the defeat of the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.Slogans of “BJPhatao desh bachao, TrinamoolhataoBanglabachao”(Remove BJP save country, defeat Trinamool save Bengal) were raised by workers of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party at a rally that was called to highlight the support base and strength of the Left parties in the State.Former West Bengal Chief Minister and veteran CPI(M) leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has been ailing for some time, made a public appearance after several months. Mr. Bhattacharjee, however, did not come on stage or address the gathering.In the well-attended rally, several Left leaders made repeated references to the united Opposition rally, where leaders from 23 parties came together at the same venue on January 19 and called for the defeat of the BJP in the Lok Sabha poll.“I have seen photographs of the rally held here, where leaders gave a call to remove [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi… There is a need to remove both the governments — BJP from Centre and Trinamool from Bengal,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said.‘Policies not leader’Mr. Yechury said the country did not need a leader but proper policies (“Neta nahin,niti ki jaroorat”). Referring to comments made by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “orchestrating riots and killing people”, Mr. Yechury asked why the Trinamool chairperson had become a Minister in the NDA government after the riots in Gujarat.Describing both the BJP and the Trinamool Congress as two faces of the same coin, the CPI(M) general secretary said both parties were indulging in shadow- boxing.Left parties such as the CPI-ML (Liberation) also joined the rally."

Charles Dickens was considered one of the greatest writers of his time. Through his writing brought into the open, the suffering and oppression of the poor and downtrodden.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"We are all familiar with the story of the Christmas ghost that comes visiting an elderly miser and shows him snippets of a life lived selfishly, causing him to change his lifestyle.This is a story by Charles Dickens. Born on February 8, 1812, he was an English writer, and created some of the best known fictional characters of his time. He was the second of eight children, and of his early life he says, “Very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy”. He spent a lot of time outdoors and was a voracious reader too. But, his sunny days came to a sudden end when his father was thrown into prison.Charles had to be lodged with a family friend, whom he later immortalised in his bookDombey and Son, as Mrs. Pipchin. Later, he went to live in the back attic of an agent for the Insolvent Court, whom he wrote about inThe Old Curiosity Shop.He had to leave school, so that he could pay for his board and help his family. He worked 10 hours a day for which he earned six shillings a week. His job? Pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. A few months later, his grandmother passed away and she bequeathed a sum of money to his father that enabled him to pay his debts and be released from prison. The family left for Marshalsea in Southwark, London. However, to Charles’ great dismay, his mother never asked for him to be released from his job. He was sufficiently hurt, “I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back”.Back to schoolHe went back to school, after which he worked as a junior clerk at a law office. He later worked as a freelance reporter. By 20, though he lacked focus on what he wanted to become, he knew he wanted fame.In 1833, he submitted his first story “A Dinner at Poplar Walk” to the London periodicalMonthly Magazine. Two years later, he began a series onStreet Sketchesfor theMorning Chronicle.The Sketches by Bozbecame popular, and he received a proposal from publishers to supply text to match the illustrations for a monthly letterpress. The resulting story becamePickwick Papers, and in its final instalment sold 40,000 copies.Over time, his success as a novelist grew. It is said the young Queen Victoria readOliver TwistandPickwick Papers,and was enthralled by them.Nicholas Nickleby(1838–39),The Old Curiosity Shop(1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel,Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty, as part of theMaster Humphrey's Clockseries (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.On June 8, 1870, Dickens suffered a stroke from which he never recovered. He has stated that he wished to be buried at Rochester Cathedral “in an inexpensive, ostentatious and, strictly private manner”, but instead was laid to rest in the Poet’s Corner of Westminster Abbey."

A documentary resurrects the 1960 tour by Assam’s Bhupen Hazarika and Bengal’s Hemango Biswas at the peak of the Assamese-Bengali conflict.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With cracks resurfacing in the relationship between the Assamese and the Bengalis due to the updation of the National Register of Citizens in Assam, a documentary intends to serve as a reminder of how music brought peace to Assam during the language riots of 1960.The documentary has been made by Rongili Biswas, daughter of legendary Bengali singer Hemango Biswas. As a precursor to the film, she has released online a music album, titled ‘Hemango-Bhupen: A Song for Everyone — Tales of the 1960 peace initiative against the linguistic riots in Assam’.The tracks play in the background while stills — many of them rare photographs — tell the story of the 1960 riots, which broke out after Assamese was made the State language. This triggered large-scale violence and arson across Assam, home to many Bengalis.It was then that Bengal’s Hemango Biswas and Assam’s Bhupen Hazarika (singer-lyricist recently honoured with Bharat Ratna) travelled with a peace caravan to pacify the mobs.The cover of the album on the 1960 tour of Hemango Biswas and Bhupen Hazarika, which has been released online.The duo travelled with a 30-member caravan across undivided Assam. “The artists came from all walks of life, representing a very rich folk tradition of various communities of Assam. Predominantly, they were from the Assam chapter of the leftist cultural movement IPTA (Indian People’s Theatre Association), which completed its 75th year in 2018,” said Ms. Biswas, an academic and musician in her own right.Ms. Biswas made the documentary, ‘A Song for Everyone’, with a grant from the Benguluru-based India Foundation for the Arts. The title has been borrowed from a poem on the mission, composed by the Bengal poet Shankha Ghosh. “But I need to re-edit the film,” Ms. Biswas said.Many hurdlesIn the film, Ms. Biswas has interviewed many of the dancers, singers and musicians — now mostly in their late eighties — associated with the 1960 caravan. They narrate how the caravan slowly evolved, overcoming obstacles.“It was not an easy situation,” recalls Uma Dutta, a danseuse with the troupe, in the film. “A local person told us before our performance in Goreswar (in northwest Assam), one of the worst-hit areas: “You Bengalis (there was another Bengali dancer, Sandhya Das) have come to perform here. Don’t you know how Bengali women were tortured here a few days back?’”Hemango Biswas noted in a small piece, ‘Let Us Meet – A report on 1960 Peace Mission’, that at almost every step of organising the event, for which he summoned Bhupen Hazarika from Kolkata, the team had to negotiate hurdles: “…both the communities tried to dissuade us. Some even made fun of us.” But the show – which had artists from Khasi, Jayantia, Nepali, Assamese and Bengali communities – was a resounding success.Rongili Biswas, daughter of singer Hemango Biswas.Shillong Observerhad noted, “Out of the gloom of riot-torn life we emerge as brothers, each with distinctive culture and language orchestrated into a magnificent harmony united in creative labour for a prosperous future.”The high point of the performance was a song, specially produced for the occasion by Hazarika and Biswas,Haradhan-Rongmon Katha, a conversational ballad that narrated the story of two farmers Haradhan and Rongmon, one Bengali and another Assamese, who had come together to survive in the backdrop of a fratricidal riot.“Just as Bhupen’s sensitive and mellifluous voice resonated with the sorrows of Haradhan, perhaps the meandering strains of Bhatiali in my voice too echoed Rongmon’s grief. The audience was overwhelmed,” noted Biswas.Strikes a chord“I remember after the programme in Nagaon, one of worst riot-hit areas, as Hemangoda and Bhupenda came down from the stage, with arms around each other, many people started crying,” recalls Ruby Hazarika, a team member. “The Gopinath Bordoloi Hall was chock-a-block and the song had a huge emotional impact,” remembers Gyanada Bora, who attended the performance as a school student.Bhupen Hazarika, who joined the BJP much later in 2004, joined IPTA after his return from the U.S. around 1952 and was “one of the most active and creative members of IPTA”, noted Hemango Biswas.Their friendship consolidated as they jointly organised the third Assam conference of IPTA in 1955, when the likes of Balraj Sahni, Salil Chowdhury and Hemanta Mukherjee participated, among others.So in 1960, “Bhupen arrived as soon as he received the telegram” to initiate his battle against fratricide. No wonder, his U.S.-based son Tez Hazarika’s initial comments on hearing that Bharat Ratna was conferred on his father echoed the sentiment: “Awarding Bhupen Hazarika with the Bharat Ratna is a win for humanity, diversity and India as a secular democracy.”The caravan — with the 30 performers in three cars and a jeep — moved from one district to another as the audiences started swelling. Not only the locals (some of whom were engaged in the conflict) joined, but many requested a performance in their localities.“[In] rural areas, especially school students…blocked our path and force us to perform. Such a programme was held in Bokakhat [where girl students] were busy cooking for us,” wrote Biswas in the article on the peace mission. Many even confessed to their mistake.“After the [Nagaon] programme, three students came up to me and confessed with much remorse that they had participated in the riots. One of them was a lead worker of the student federation,” he wrote.In Tezpur and later in Mongoldoi, Assam IPTA’s president and cultural icon Bishnu Prasad Rabha “demonstrated how the [British] colonial rule created a division and rift between different ethnic and linguistic groups” and the post-independence Congress government continued the “legacy forward.”Interestingly, it was the Congress government which arranged for the peace tour after the caravan’s maiden performance in Shillong, realising that the Assamese-Bengali conflict was spiralling out of control.“Bhupen and I got an invitation from the Chief Minister [Bimala Prasad Chaliha] and administrative responsibilities were delegated to Home Minister Fakhruddin Ali Saheb (later President of India),” noted Biswas.Hazarika noted in an essay that the Chief Minister confessed that he had “lost the battle” against linguistic nationalists. “You do whatever you can. Killings are rising with each passing day,” Chaliha told Hazarika. Then Home Minister Ahmed promised “everything” to make the peace caravan a success.“After so much of travelling we, the members of the Let Us Meet cultural troupe — who hardly used to know each other in the beginning – became one unit, a family,” Hazarika says in the film.Ms. Biswas plans to bring out, by next summer, a book containing short memoirs of Hazarika and Biswas, their letters, the songs and poems performed on the tour and small essays by them on each other. “Perhaps this is the most fitting time to revisit their works as the situation is appearing to be more complex than ever in Assam,” she said."
Modi organised riots and killing of people: Mamata Banerjee,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/modi-organised-riots-and-killing-of-people-mamata-banerjee/article26163720.ece,,https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday accusing him of “orchestrating riots and killing people” to come to power, minutes after Mr. Modi had at a public rally in Durgapur charged the Trinamool Congress chief with running extortion rackets in the State.Describing Mr. Modi as the “grandfather of corruption,” she told a Bengali television channel in an interview that the Prime Minister had triggered “a politics of vendetta”.If the first day of Mr. Modi’s campaign in the State is any indication, West Bengal is set to witness a bitter, no-holds-barred battle between the BJP leader and Ms. Banerjee in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election.In his speech, Mr. Modi accused the Chief Minister of “trying to block CBI investigations in the State”.“He was interrogated because he orchestrated a riot and killed people, it is a fact,” Ms. Banerjee said. “Godhra happened in Gujarat, everybody knows. He now says, he will interrogate people because he was interrogated… what kind of logic is that? He was guilty so he was interrogated… this is politics of vendetta.”However, she was conciliatory when talking about Home Minister Rajnath Singh. Asked about a comment by Mr. Singh blaming the State government of inaction in checking illegal immigration, Ms. Banerjee said he had no option but to say what Mr. Modi and Amit Shah wanted him to say.“Mr. Singh is helpless. He has no option but to repeat whatever they [Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah] want him to say. I do not know whether I should say this and perhaps it is not … they are also framing Rajnath’s son. They have filed FIR against him [Rajnath’s son]. Whatever they [Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah] want you to say... [you] have to say, that is the policy,” Ms. Banerjee asserted.On corruption, she countered that it would be Mr. Modi who would face probes over issues like demonetisation and the Jan Dhan scheme, once he was out of power. “The truth will be out,” she said, adding that in order to cover up “corrupt activities”, Mr. Modi was engaging in syndicates of his own.“These are syndicates of lynchings, cow vigilantes, syndicates of [investigative] agencies and syndicates of riots. However we will not allow them to orchestrate riots in Bengal and make Bengalis fight the Bengalis, or divide Hindus and Muslims,” she asserted.We will not let them disturb Assam and the northeastern region or let them push Biharis or people from Uttar Pradesh out of the State [of Gujarat]…India will not get divided, rather he [Mr. Modi] will go,” she said.“They ask about Saradha and Narada scams, which will not be proved; I would like to ask why chit funds were not investigated between 1980 and 2011,” she said. Referring to Mr. Modi’s jibe that the Opposition was scared of his anti-corruption stand and therefore uniting against him, Ms. Banerjee contended that on the contrary the “BJP is scared” and bringing leaders from across the country to fight her in West Bengal."

‘BJP govt. ruled without appeasement’
",,"BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had ensured development for all without appeasement. With the shrinking of the Congress, there was a dip in communal violence across the country, he said.Mr. Shah was addressing the inaugural session of the BJP’s minority wing national council meet. Keeping a steady attack on the Opposition Congress, Mr. Shah said, “Jaise jaise Congress aur uske kul ke sarkarein samapt hotey gaye, waisey his desh main dange bhi samapt hotey gaye(Just as Congress-led governments went out of power across the country, communal riots too starting ebbing).”“I want to ask those who indulge in the politics of appeasement, you ruled for decades, what did you do for minorities?” he said.

A century-old residence gets a makeover, yet retains its glory at the hands of architect Husna Rahamanwho deftly plays with hues and patterns. By Nandhini Sundar
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When an architect is faced with a century-old residence or even one that is half the age, his/her immediate reaction is to demolish and develop the site or build a fabulous contemporary dwelling, money and space permitting.Today, restoring such a building to its former glory is beyond the radar, especially given the economics behind such an initiative. The state of the structure and the lifestyle the interior facilities offer, further promote this inclination.But when architect Husna Rahaman of Fulcrum Studio was given the century-old sprawling 7,000 sq. ft colonial home for restoration — the structure essentially a no-nonsense load-bearing piece of engineering that cannot be tampered with on whim — she realised that strategic alterations, if any, could happen only where necessary.The entire restoration thus occurred on a delicate balance of reverence and relevance, the regal aura retained while the modern functional quotient was brought in where relevant.Playing with patternsIn tune with the era it related to, the residence came with its accompanying hues and patterns that literally saturated the spaces, the patterned antique floor and wall tiles engulfing the ambience.And so, without shunning this past grandeur, Rahaman set about managing deftly the play of hues and patterns where they would enchant and refresh, without submerging the senses. “It was literally a riot of colours and this base was used as a spring board to complement the residence where it is not eliminated but used to balance,” she explains.Keeping this intent in perspective, an elegant network of wood verticals and horizontals were brought in to frame the length and breadth of the expansive living area.A new set of chandeliers were added, yet the design of these were kept deliberately colonial in keeping with the structure’s flavour.The rich flooring was retained, along with the porcelain tile dadoing on the walls, both in the living area as well as rest of the residence.A refreshing contemporary twist was brought into the home by introducing metal motifs on the walls, the motifs reflecting the existing patterns. While the walls and the ceiling continue to accommodate the wooden columns and beams, a colourful reminder of the colonial past, the architect ensures a contemporary flavour wafts into the sturucture through concealed lights and varied metal motifs.Contemporary upgradeThe living area reveals the presence of two groups of furniture, each connected by a large back-to-back sofa cluster. The unusual blend of materials and styles seen in the living area and carried methodically into the rest of the residence, where luxury is paired with minimalism and exquisite Indian crafts tie in seamlessly with streamlined forms, reveals a reverential contemporary upgrade of a glorious past.While the strong imperial character of the structure has been reverentially retained, the spaces have been infused with warmth to address the home it ultimately is. This has been successfully achieved through application of soft roses on the walls, neutral colours with subtle pops of colour in the rugs, strips of wallpaper and cushions in shades of pink and orange.Likewise, the spatial poetry of the house, an element lacking in modern crowded structures, has been preserved to integrate the multiple rooms.Infusing metalGiven the era of the residence, metal does not figure in its construction. Yet, metal has been craftily infiused nto the stately space, lightening the palette.The floral medallion in the living area serves as a symbolic confluence of the metallic motifs used in the rest of the residence. Metal also features as an artistic railing for the staircase, replacing the previous cement and brick staircase. The terrace further reveals a stunning dark grey metal gazebo to unwind and relax, besides serving as an entertainment zone when need arises.Sun roomThe first level of the building came with narrow spaces, yet the interiors were filled with abundant natural light. Rahaman decided to capture this effectively to create a sunny library. “The room came with its quota of colours and patterns like the rest of the house and the space was converted into a turquoise library with a western exposure by merely introducing rugs into the space,” she says.The ‘sun room’ reveals rugs in intense hues of ochre and turquoise blue, soaked in geometric patterns where they define the floor, with the turquoise blue and wood verticals on the walls complementing the same. Vibrant in conception, the space greets with a burst of exuberance, the twin daybeds created between the columns further enhancing with their presence.The contemporary flavour wafts into the spaces through concealed lights and metal motifs"

The rivers Thames and Vrushabhavati, the mishaps, museums and more common things between Bangalore and London
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"River Thames has played a major role in shaping the commerce, trade, culture and lifestyle of London. But, the resultant growth of the city itself has become a bane to the river as the effluents and sewage found its way into the water, converting it into an unhealthy, stinking cesspool. By the year 1236, Thames was so contaminated that it was useless and unhygienic. During the subsequent centuries, the administrators took rapid measures to clean the river and by 1450 they could establish domestic water supply from the river.In 1858, the failing drainage turned River Thames into a deadly stinking sewer. It was infamously referred to as the ‘Great Stink”. The Punch Magazine in its issue of July 10, 1858, published a cartoon with the titleThe Silent Highway Man,depicting the horrible plight of Thames flowing near St. Paul Church. A human skeleton, shrouded in black cloth was rowing a small boat with dead rats and some other creatures. Again, London rulers rose to the occasion and with their herculean efforts brought life back to the river. By 1950, yet again, rapid growth of the city turned Thames into dirty water flow. Foreseeing the impending disaster, London Authorities launched a huge project with very strict measures in 1954, to prevent the flow of the industrial effluents, sewerage and all other rubbish into the river. It took almost a decade to complete the processes. Today, Thames is a major tourist attraction of Europe. It’s a pleasant experience to have a boat ride on the river sailing under all the bridges. A blue plaque indicates that over 100 types of fishes live in Thames.In Bangalore, just one century back there was a smaller version of Thames called Vrushbhavati. An inscription at the base of the left foot of the bull at Bull Temple suggests the origin of an underground stream at that point. The water used to get collected in a big depression forming a pond, then known as Basavannana Kere. Later, it went downstream towards Hosakere Halli, and continued as a visible rivulet, taking a turn near Gali Anjaneya Temple, went further parallel to Mysore Road to join River Arkavati. Many nonagenarians recall how crystal clear the rivulet was and it was utilized to cultivate crops and vegetables. But, the formation of new extensions like Basavanagudi, Chamarajapet, resulted in the flow of sewerage joining the river. The uncontrolled flow of industrial effluents worsened the situation. Though sewerage treatment plants were set up, the uncontrolled growth of the city, and the resultant inflow of huge quantity of dirty water have become insufficient in solving the problem. Like the ‘Great Stink’ of London, Vrushabhavati also came to be known as ‘Kengeri Mori’(gutter). However, since last few years, some NGOs are grouping together to sensitize the industrialists and the concerned authorities to control the inflow of sewer and effluents into the river. In fact, there are a few local talents who say that it is possible to convert the flow into little ‘Thames of Bangalore’ and even generate some quantity of electricity to illuminate the garden that could be laid on the banks near Mysore Road. What is required is strict implementation of law by the authorities and realisation by the general public about the urgent need of restoring the river.London is a city of disasters and misfortunes. Since the beginning, the city has been ravaged by riots, loots, attacks, smog, famine, plague, cholera, Black death, world wars, fire and floods. The fiercest enemies of London are fire and water. Since the beginning of London’s history there have been more than a dozen major fire breakouts, burning different parts of the city. But, a little spark originated in a small bakery, on September 2, 1666 engulfed the City of London and is considered as one of the 10 Great Fires of the world. Similarly, the floods of Thames had almost drowned the city in1928 and 1947. In spite of all these disasters, every time London has risen like a Phoenix from the ashes. In Bangalore, there have been sieges by Marathas and Mughals. The third Anglo Mysore war in March 1791 is a major attack on Bangalore. Yet, compared to London the damage to life and property was less.Few major fire mishaps in our city were at the Venus Circus, Carlton Towers, K. R. market (caused by crackers). In spite of these tragedies, we do hear about fire safety norms not being followed in many public places. Rains have caused havocs in low lying areas of the city. But it is more due to callous attitude of the concerned authorities than due to rain itself.London is a city of museums. There have been several such centers depicting various facets of the city’s history. London Museum gives a clear picture of 2000 years history of London. The huge exhibition centre has been built on the location which was ravaged by bombs during the second world war.Bangalore too has more than 12 museums including the attractive Government Museum at Kasturba Road. There is an exclusive Kempegowda Museum at MG road to showcase our city’s history. Yet, there is an immediate need to build Bangalore Museum on the lines of London Museum in a bigger and better location.London is one of the few major tourist destinations of the world. The tourist friendly city promotes itself through souvenirs and mementos done on all the icons of London. The colorful pictorial time line of London History is available in almost all places of the city at a reasonable prize.In Bangalore, attempts have been made both at MG Road and Kempegowda Bus Station to give the time line of Bangalore history. Some enthusiasts are making souvenirs with the pictures of some monuments of the city.The sole purpose of London-Bangalore comparative study series written in this column is not to make Bangalore an another London but to make our city a Better Bangalore.London-Bangalore series concluded.[email protected]"

Charles Dickens was considered one of the greatest writers of his time. Through his writing brought into the open, the suffering and oppression of the poor and downtrodden.
",https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"We are all familiar with the story of the Christmas ghost that comes visiting an elderly miser and shows him snippets of a life lived selfishly, causing him to change his lifestyle.This is a story by Charles Dickens. Born on February 8, 1812, he was an English writer, and created some of the best known fictional characters of his time. He was the second of eight children, and of his early life he says, “Very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy”. He spent a lot of time outdoors and was a voracious reader too. But, his sunny days came to a sudden end when his father was thrown into prison.Charles had to be lodged with a family friend, whom he later immortalised in his bookDombey and Son, as Mrs. Pipchin. Later, he went to live in the back attic of an agent for the Insolvent Court, whom he wrote about inThe Old Curiosity Shop.He had to leave school, so that he could pay for his board and help his family. He worked 10 hours a day for which he earned six shillings a week. His job? Pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. A few months later, his grandmother passed away and she bequeathed a sum of money to his father that enabled him to pay his debts and be released from prison. The family left for Marshalsea in Southwark, London. However, to Charles’ great dismay, his mother never asked for him to be released from his job. He was sufficiently hurt, “I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back”.Back to schoolHe went back to school, after which he worked as a junior clerk at a law office. He later worked as a freelance reporter. By 20, though he lacked focus on what he wanted to become, he knew he wanted fame.In 1833, he submitted his first story “A Dinner at Poplar Walk” to the London periodicalMonthly Magazine. Two years later, he began a series onStreet Sketchesfor theMorning Chronicle.The Sketches by Bozbecame popular, and he received a proposal from publishers to supply text to match the illustrations for a monthly letterpress. The resulting story becamePickwick Papers, and in its final instalment sold 40,000 copies.Over time, his success as a novelist grew. It is said the young Queen Victoria readOliver TwistandPickwick Papers,and was enthralled by them.Nicholas Nickleby(1838–39),The Old Curiosity Shop(1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel,Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty, as part of theMaster Humphrey's Clockseries (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.On June 8, 1870, Dickens suffered a stroke from which he never recovered. He has stated that he wished to be buried at Rochester Cathedral “in an inexpensive, ostentatious and, strictly private manner”, but instead was laid to rest in the Poet’s Corner of Westminster Abbey."
