As suspense continues on her plan to rejoin Cong., AAP dares her to quit MLA seat
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Having said this week that she was ready to rejoin the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Chandni Chowk Alka Lamba on Saturday said she would “work to defeat the BJP” when asked whether she would quit AAP.Alleging “lack of democracy” within AAP and “disrespect” towards MLAs by party convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Ms. Lamba said she would work against what the BJP stands for. After having been associated with the Congress for 20 years and being the National Students’ Union of India president, she had joined AAP in 2014 and was elected as an AAP MLA in 2015.With Ms. Lamba publicly talking about her disagreements with AAP, Congress general secretary in-charge of Delhi P.C. Chacko had on Friday said the party would “welcome” her back as she had been a “member of the family”.Chacko’s statementSpeaking toThe Hinduon Saturday, Ms. Lamba said she was thankful for Mr. Chacko’s statement, but no one from the Congress had approached her so far.Meanwhile, AAP spokesperson and Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj took to Twitter to take a jibe at Ms. Lamba.“To join the Congress, Alka Lamba would need to resign from AAP. That would mean losing her MLA seat — the MLA seat which lured some to AAP, the MLA seat which many could not get even after serving Congress for 20+ years. It requires courage to leave that MLA seat,” Mr. Bharadwaj said.When asked to respond to Mr. Bharadwaj’s statement, Ms. Lamba said, “I take it as the official statement of the party since he is the spokesperson. I would like to ask the party about what has been done with me since December 21...What about the 15-20 MLAs who were disrespected by Mr. Kejriwal in a meeting with workers?”.She added that she had decided to “work to defeat the BJP” and would “work for the victory of thegathbandhancandidate from Chandni Chowk”, in case an AAP-Congress alliance for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections materialises.On December 21, 2018, AAP MLAs had moved a resolution seeking justice for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots’ victims.While reading the resolution, AAP MLA Jarnail Singh asked for the Bharat Ratna awarded to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to be withdrawn in context of some statements he made in the wake of his mother, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination.Ms. Lamba had objected to the inclusion of this demand, and had offered to resign. Though the resolution was passed, senior AAP leaders had denied that the demand was included in the resolution and when the bulletin of the Assembly proceedings was published the next week, there was no mention of Rajiv Gandhi."

The Nawabs played Holi
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-nawabs-played-holi/article26564375.ece,"
Ahead of the festival of colours, let’s recall how the Walled City celebrated the festival
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Nawabs and nawabzadas playing Holi despite Islamic taboo may sound far-fetched, but is not untrue. Delhi’s Nawab Buddhan of Suiwalan, Nawab Dojana of Matia Mahal, the Nawab of Basai Darapur and Nawab F. Z. Khan of Agra, did not mind a bit of colour revelry in post-1857 days. Their families enjoyed it too. For the women, it meant catching relatives and friends unawares early in the morning, splashing them with cold water and colouring their faces with red and black powder. “Tu bilkul churail lag rahi hai Bhabhi” (sister-in-law you are really looking like a she-ghost) was one of the epithets hurled during the sudden tamasha. Fun over, it was time to clean up the mess and change soiled clothes for visits by sethanis (wives of the city seths) who brought sweets and other savouries in abundance. This is what Mohd Mian Akbar, a Ballimaran shoe merchant, used to say up to his death in the 1980s. However, to counter his view (despite repetition) here is what an Englishman had to say a 100 years earlier:“Holi” is celebrated by Hindus but not by Muslims, who resent colour being thrown on them. The festival falls in March which corresponds to the Indian month of Phagun, when the colours of spring transform the landscape as if by the magic brush of a painter who, with deft strokes changes the bleak scenario of winter to the yellow, pink and golden hues of “Basant”, said Capt Ridgeway in his diary before the outbreak of the first war of independence, in Delhi. By that time the heat of summer was to bring about a drastic change in the natural surroundings, with tree leaves drooping under the impact of the blazing sun. The only redeeming feature, Ridgeway noted, was the pleasantness of the early mornings and late evenings, “when the heat subsided and one went to the gardens for fresh air and figs sold in leaf-cups the size of dessert quarter-plates”.Tense timesPeople did celebrate Holi in 1857 but it was much subdued the next year, when the British had regained full control of the Capital and the surrounding areas. The same thing happened 90 years later in 1947 when Partition was yet to be effected. Contrary to popular perception, some leading Muslims, among whom were nawabs, did celebrate the festival of colours with great enthusiasm that year too as their ancestors had been courtiers at the durbar of Mohammad Shah Rangila and later Shah Alam, Akbar Shah Sani and Bahadur Shah Zafar.Among them, Mohammad Shah and Zafar celebrated Holi with great gusto, though Shah Alam did not mind dabbling in colours with Maratha chieftains, whose leader, Mahadji Scindia, was the most powerful military leader in North India with the emperor under his thumb. Akbar Shah did not mind his financiers, the bullion merchants of Chandni Chowk led by Seth Sidhu Mal, putting gulal on his forehead and sprinkling rosewater on his royal clothes, which dried up very fast, leaving behind a faint perfume. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the least orthodox of them, liked the Holi revelry of his subjects and also participated in it, but with regard to his status as the inheritor of Mughal dignity. The orthodox nobles of his court however preferred to stay indoors during the time the colour-throwing was at its peak.In 1948, post-Partition, Holi was celebrated on a subdued note in Delhi, Agra and other prominent cities. There were warnings from the police that colour was not to be thrown on unwilling people, yet there was perceptible tension in Chandni Chowk, Daryaganj, Paharganj and Dev Nagar. Fearing a riot, a strong police force was made to patrol the thoroughfares, along with the armed constabulary on the orders of Mr Beadon. Though there was no rioting, sporadic clashes were reported from some areas, where a sort of curfew-like situation prevailed later.Change of colourHowever, by 1949, conditions became stable and Holi was celebrated without major incidents. In the mid-1950s the nawabzadas of Aligarh and Agra, along with some kunwars of Wazirpura and Dhirpura celebrated Holi in style in Chandni Chowk. They went about in an old weapon-carrier spraying colour on all and sundry with rubber tubes immersed in big drums filled with coloured water.That year, like other years, also saw grand celebrations outside Lala Chunna Mal’s haveli. In the Jama Masjid area, a much-married Urdu poet, one of whose compositions is echoed in the film song, “Gal Gulabi, chaal sharabi/Aap se accha kohi nahin hai”, went about greeting his men and women friends in the Walled City and presenting them his romantic verses sprinkled with wet gulal.A practice in those days for Hindi newspapers was to award “Holi degrees” to friends, colleagues, acquaintances and also political leaders. These were in the form of one-line sentences which were both ribald and hilarious. About that time one old tradition that has ended was the Christian Holi, celebrated on Shrove Tuesday, a day before Ash Wednesday, and the beginning of the fasting season of Lent. Now Holi has lost much of its colourful past and even the colours are scarce as black and silver paint and infection-causing dirty water is generally used.No fears of infection were aroused when the Nawab of Loharu played Holi in unpolluted times with the Nawab of Tonk and his own brother-in-law Mirza Ghalib. The poet, however, missed the revelry of Braj Holi in his native Agra and the titillating colour-soaked verses of Mian Nazir Akbarabadi on the much-maligned ""Holi-ka-Bhudua-Diwali-ka-chor"", the fictitious buffoons made the butt of irksome jokes during the two change of season festivals."

Narendra Modi has no concern for the poor, oppressed, farmers: Ajit Singh ",https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/modi-has-no-concern-for-the-poor-oppressed-farmers-ajit-singh/article26561218.ece,"
In a democracy, we need a PM who listens to everybody, consults everyone, then takes a decision, the RLD chief says.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Moving away from his traditional seat of Bhagpat where he was trounced in 2014, veteran Jat leader and Rashtriya Lok Dal president Ajit Singh says he is contesting from Muzaffarnagar to heal the violent communal divide. The 80-year-old former Union Minister said the 2019 polls are crucial for democracy and preserving constitutional bodies.How important is this election for you, especially after a string of defeats?How important this election is for me, that’s not the question. [The question is] how important it is for the country, for democracy, for keeping our Constitution and saving all our constitutional bodies. If people lose faith in constitutional bodies, there is no democracy. Therefore, this is a very important election. And like Mr. [Amit] Shah said, if Modi wins this time he will be Prime Minister for 50 years. That means there will be no democracy.You think it’s a greater challenge than RLD, SP or BSP...Than me or who is winning... And one thing is very clear as far as U.P. is concerned, this combination, nobody can beat.Why do you think so?Look at the arithmetic.Just arithmetic or is there anything else to the alliance?Every part of society, be it farmers, youth, minority or Dalits — everybody is angry with the government. See, the election in a democracy is all about what they have done in the five years; whether to give them another chance . If you look at it, they have not done anything, except lot of promises of which they haven’t kept a single one. To farmers, they said they will give 150 times the cost, not done. For the youth, two crore jobs per year, now they are saying ‘makepakoras’. And clean Ganga... nothing has happened. Made in India, nothing. Smart cities, not there. So what has he done? Those are the questions and as the campaign progresses, all these questions will come up again. See, all the TV and newspapers are now saying that because of what happened [in Balakot]... but these are the issues on which people will decide. As far as that issue [Balakot airstrike] is concerned, everybody is with the army.You have contested many times from Baghpat. But in 2014, not only did you lose, you stood a surprise third. So this time...The last election, at least in this part of India, was not normal because of those riots in Muzaffarnagar.Why did you choose to contest from Muzaffarnagar?Because the riot started from here. Muzaffarnagar’s message went to the whole country. And this was the reason why the BJP won.So you want to uproot the BJP from here?Yes.But isn’t this a big risk for you, since Muzaffarnagar was the hotbed of that violence and communal divide?On February 13 last year, I went to Muzaffarnagar. February 12 was my birthday, I completed 79 years. So I said, the 80th year I will spend on getting rid of that communal divide. I called itbhaichara(brotherhood). And for the last one year, I have been to at least 10 districts, two or three times and stayed there overnight, talking to different groups. So that thing is gone now. The communal divide is not there. And the Kairana election cemented the bonding together of vote banks... our votebank.Jats and Muslims are coming together like before?Yes, yes! In Kairana, not only that, our core voter voted, farmers of all castes and religions voted. Another big issue here is the cow. Cows are worshipped and they forever have been. As far as the farmers are concerned their livestock was their ATM; you need money, you go sell some cattle. Now they didn’t get their price for the sugar cane — this area depends on sugar cane for its economic survival — and then these animals are eating up their other crops. So there is a great deal of anger. That’s a very big issue here.Is that going to be a part of your campaign?I watched a lot of social media and YouTube videos, in which farmers are saying, ‘Look what Yogi is doing, eating the crops.’ They call them [stray cows] Yogi and Modi.But the BJP is projecting it like they are actually protecting cows from being slaughtered...Everybody can see what the situation is; they are worse off than they were earlier.Apart from sugar cane, cows, and communal divide that you want to heal, anything else that will be an important issue?Unemployment is a very big issue.Notebandihas destroyed the informal economy. And then look at GST, look at farmers, first they declare MSP, then they import all the commodities from abroad. Last year, was there a need to import sugar? Three years ago, they imported wheat when there was a bumper crop. Two years ago, they imported lentils when there was an oversupply of it.They declared MSP but depressed the market price. So farmer doesn’t get the MSP. Then the electricity prices have gone up, double. Tractors used to be tax free but now been declared commercial vehicles and every year they have to pay tax. Now there is GST too if you are buying a tractor or its parts. Now they are saying, every 10 years you have to buy a new tractor. No farmer can afford it. They run them for 40 years. They have no idea of the rural economy. This has not only affected the farmers. That money circulated in the area. I tell these small businessmen and traders, if ₹10,000 crore is given as farmers’ sugar cane dues, in three months this will be all in your pockets. Everybody is affected right now.Have the dues been paid back to the sugar cane farmers?Mr. Modi has been saying that we have done so and we will pay in 14 days and he would not accept whatever the [actual] figures are. But it’s a plain and simple lie.RSS and BJP say other governments were corrupt and they are not...Ask any person in a village or town, ‘Has corruption increased?’ They all stand up and say ‘yes’. Forget everything, we need a PM in a democracy, who listens to everybody, consults everyone and then takes a decision. He [Mr Modi] doesn’t listen to anyone, doesn’t consult anyone or answer any questions or any press conference. We need a PM...chappan inch ki chaati theek hai, lekin dil bada hona chaiye(a 56-inch chest is fine but one must also be big-hearted). But Modi has no concern for the poor, oppressed, farmers and the unemployed.Are you happy with the three seats that have been given to you as part of the alliance (Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Mathura)?In a combination or seat adjustment, no party is ever happy. Therefore, the question is not that. It is larger. There may be all these seat differences, but in U.P., we didn’t take too much time to discuss and bicker about it... because everybody realises that it is not important.You expect that your core voter will stick with you in Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar. But in other seats where the SP and BSP are contesting, will your voters transfer to them?Yes, yes. As I said, I had gone to 10 districts...with those bhaichara meetings, so they understand.So Jats are also angry with the BJP?They are basically farmers and aggressive farmers. The farmer’s situation and the farming community feels they are being left out.On April 7, you, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati will hold a rally in Saharanpur, kicking off your joint campaign. How important is it for U.P. that you three have come together?Let me put it this way, in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana, the combination already existed. Now we have formalised it."

Christchurch: Filmmaker blames unchecked tech use
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/christchurch-filmmaker-blames-unchecked-tech-use/article26557338.ece,,,"Veteran filmmaker Kumar Shahani has said the Christchurch terror attack is a fallout of the unquestioned proliferation of technology.Speaking at a session on ‘Culture and Education’, organised as part of the Young Scholars Congress (YSC) here on Saturday, Mr. Shahani said the ghastly incident in New Zealand brought to the fore the rationality behind the patronage extended to the arms industry in the world.“It is high time we questioned the non-neutral use of technology that are being utilised. Technologies have become powerful so much that they are beyond scrutiny,” he said.He also criticised the reluctance shown by global leaders including United States President Donald Trump in demanding harsher gun control laws. “Mr. Trump has evaded from making a statement against the arms lobby. The proliferation of arms and ammunition has led to the emergence of militant powers who possessed the technology to wage wars,” Mr. Shahani said.He also drew parallels of the live streaming of the massacre in New Zealand with incidents that have occurred in India. “The mass rapes, which were filmed during the Surat riots in 1992, showed how imaging could be used for evil purposes. Such actions were fundamentally against human values,” he said.Noted poet Prabha Varma, academicians Meena T. Pillai, C. Padmanabhan and A. Pasalathil also participated in the session."

The police responded with teargas and water cannon.After weeks of declining participation, France's ""yellow vest"" protest movement attempted to rebound with a major rally in Paris which quickly turned violent.A large crowd gathered on the Champs-Elysees avenue for the 18th straight week of anti-government protests which initially rocked President Emmanuel Macron's administration, forcing him to adopt more anti-poverty measures, but had appeared to fizzle in recent weeks.Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who erected barricades near the Champs-Elysees in scenes reminiscent of some of the most tense “yellow vest” rallies.Saturday's attempted reboot coincides with the end of two months of public debates called by Mr. Macron to take the heat out of the protests, which repeatedly ended in rioting in December and January.The level of participation will be seen as a bellwether of support for the movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes but quickly ballooned into an anti-Macron revolt.Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17.The organisers of Saturday's protest presented it as an “ultimatum” to Mr. Macron, prompting fears of a return to the violence that characterised earlier rallies.Over 5,000 police were deployed.A large security cordon had been thrown up around the Champs-Elysees, where the Arc de Triomphe war memorial was sacked and stores looted and vandalised by protesters on December 1 in images that caused shock worldwide.In December, Mr. Macron attempted to stopper the movement by pledging €10 billion ($11.2 billion) in tax cuts and benefits for the low paid and pensioners.He also launched a “grand national debate” on the internet and town hall meetings to gather opinions on how the country could be reformed.Laurent Casanova, an engineer who was among the protesters, toldAFPhe had come to mark the end of the consultations.“We have been patient but now we want results,” he said.The protest is one of several planned in Paris on Saturday, where French climate campaigners are also planning a “March of The Century”."

The Arc de Triomphe, which was sacked by protesters on December 1, was again the focal point of the unrest.Black-clad demonstrators encircled the square surrounding the arch, pelting the police with stones. “Macron, we’re coming to get you at home,” some of the protesters chanted, referring to the presidential palace near the Champs-Elysees. Thirty-one people had been arrested by mid-morning, the police said.Interior Minister Christophe Castaner condemned the violence as the work of “professional trouble-makers” who had “infiltrated” the march and said he had ordered police to “react with the greatest firmness to these unacceptable attacks.”Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17."

Ronaldo’s hat-trick lifts Juventus into Champions League quarter-finals
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored a spectacular hat-trick to fire Juventus into the Champions League quarter-finals with a 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid on Tuesday that saw his side claim a thrilling tie 3-2 on aggregate.The Portuguese superstar scored two headers either side of half-time and a late penalty to clinch a place in Friday's last-eight draw with a dominant display by the Italian champions in Turin.‘This is why Juve brought me’“It was always going to be a special night and it was, not only for the goals, but for the team,” said Ronaldo. “This is the mentality of champions. This is why Juve brought me in, to help on magical nights like this.”Diego Simeone's Atletico were a shadow of the team who had run riot in the first leg in Madrid, and crashed out of the tournament they had been hoping to win in their own Wanda Metropolitano Stadium on June 1.It is the eighth time that Ronaldo has scored a hat-trick in the competition and mirrors his treble which lifted former club Real Madrid past Wolfsburg in April 2016 with the Spaniards 2-0 down after the first leg.Juventus signed 34-year-old Ronaldo last summer from Real Madrid for 100 million euros in order to make the difference on the continent for the Italian champions, who have not won the Champions League since 1996 and have finished runners-up twice in the past four seasons.And five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo pulled out a spectacular performance as he spearheaded the attack along with Federico Bernardeschi and Mario Mandzukic.Dominant JuveAllegri's side came out firing, dominating the first half with nine shots on goal compared to three for the Spaniards.Atletico had an early scare when Juventus skipper Giorgio Chiellini, making his 500th Juve appearance, had the ball in the back of the net after four minutes.But a VAR review confirmed Ronaldo had fouled goalkeeper Jan Oblak in a scramble in front of goal before defender Chiellini had finished off.Defensive specialists Atletico held off the Juventus pressure until the 27th minute, when Ronaldo met a pin-point Bernardeschi cross to head home the opener.A Chiellini header from a Miralem Pjanic corner was cleared by Oblak, before Alvaro Morata missed a chance for an away goal before the break when he shook off Leonardo Bonucci only to head over.But back after the break Ronaldo levelled the tie with his second goal with a move he began from his own half with a pass to Leonardo Spinazzola down the left.The ball was worked to Joao Cancelo, who crossed into the penalty area for Ronaldo, whose powerful header was pushed out by Oblak but not before it had crossed over the line.Teenager Moise Kean then missed a chance to put Juve ahead just after coming off the bench.But the decisive goal came with four minutes left when Bernardeschi burst into the penalty area from the left and was brought down by Angel Correa.Ronaldo made no mistake from the spot to score his 25th goal against Atletico, and fourth hat-trick, to spark pandemonium among the home crowd.

The Dosmoche festival is celebrated to purify the town by burning down evil spirits
",,"The dreary, cold winter morning in Leh comes alive with a riot of colours and the pleasant sound of sacred chants. The ringing of bells signals ceremony and the drum announces the imminent ritual, the gongs proclaim the forthcoming festival and the ‘wooden fish’ (wooden percussion instrument) keeps rhythm with the guttural chants of the Buddhist monks that resonate from the Leh Palace. It is a time to purge and purify the town, a time to lure all the evil spirits and burn them down.Attired in their best Ladakhi traditional costume, thousands of people from the nearby valleys of Leh gather to celebrate the Dosmoche, the Buddhist festival of the 'scapegoat' that falls in the second half of February. It is a unique annual celebration by the Buddhists of the Vajrayana School.Comfortably perching on the rocks and boulders around the courtyard of the Leh Palace, people gather to witness the monks in vibrant coloured clothes, wearing formidable masks made of wood and mud to perform the sacred mask dance known as the Chams, depicting stories from the Buddhist Scriptures.The monks, on the first day fashion a hideous human effigy, a ‘sthorma’ (the scapegoat) out of dough and simultaneously create ‘Tomas’ sculptures made from barley and butter. A wooden mast made from colourful threads, decorated with paper streamers and religious symbols, designed by the monks of the Thakthok Monastery is erected in the centre of the crowded town. This is believed to hold the evil in captive.On the second day, after a preliminary offering to the Gods in the Palace Chambers, the monks carry the Sthorma and the Tomas to the centre of the town to be burnt. The procession consists of folk musicians, monks playing their traditional instruments, monastic priests donning masks and other holy gurus chanting prayers to ward off the evil spirits.The storma scapegoat on its way to be burnt during the Dormosche festival in LehAll the Tomas and the Sthorma are disjointed and thrown into a bonfire. These are the 'scapegoat's that entice the hungry ghosts, symbols of eternal starvation and greed. The demons and devils of the past year follow them and are annihilated in the fire. The wooden mast with threads is ripped apart and thrown into the blaze.Gaudy gambling dens, food counters, roadside traders selling an assortment of wares like clothes, footwear, trinkets and spices in the centre of the town add to the excitement of this festive celebration.Besides Leh, the Dosmoche that is fixed according to the Tibetan Lunar Calendar is celebrated with equal élan in the monasteries of Likir in Lower Ladakh and Deskit in the Nubra Valley.The writers are ace photographers known for their travelogues"

A compromise is still possible: on Ayodhya dispute
",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-compromise-is-still-possible/article26502542.ece,"
But there is need for clarity on the status of one mediator and the efficacy of mediation on Ayodhya ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court’s attempt to maintain Hindu-Muslim harmonythrough a mediated settlementof the long-standing Babri Masjid dispute deserves appreciation. But it has raised a couple of concerns too. One relates to the choice of a mediator, and the other to the efficacy of mediation at this stage.Mediator neutralityBy definition, a mediator is a neutral third party who facilitates a negotiated settlement between adversarial contenders. Unfortunately, the neutrality of one of the three court-appointed mediators, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, has come into question as some of his public pronouncements in the recent past appear to negate his supposed disinterestedness.A year ago, in an open letter to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had said: “People from both communities who are adamant on following the court’s verdict are also driving the issue to a situation of defeat.” The “best solution”, therefore, is “an out-of-court settlement in which the Muslim bodies come forward and gift one acre of land to the Hindus who in turn will gift five acres of land nearby to the Muslims, to build a better mosque.”Also ReadAyodhya title dispute: Who are the mediators appointed by the Supreme Court?He even told Muslims that giving up their claim to the disputed property did not amount to “surrendering this land to the people who demolished the Babri Masjid or to a particular organisation. On the contrary, they are gifting it to the people of India”.Apart from the fact that this position betrays Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s bias in favour of disputants belonging to one religion, it is difficult to understand the justifiability of treating a gift to Hindus as a gift to the people of India. Does he regard only Hindus as “the people of India” to the exclusion of other communities?Nonetheless, it stands to reason that Muslims would be in a position to gift the land only when their ownership of it is confirmed by the Supreme Court. If Muslims lose the case, the entire land would come under the control of Hindus and the question of Muslims giving up their claim would then be rendered redundant.But the Art of Living founder thinks that even a Hindu victory would not be conducive to peace. It could foster Muslim resentment and may “lead to riots throughout the country”, he told the AIMPLB, thereby insinuating that Muslims are violent. He seems to be unaware that Muslims have agreed to abide by the court verdict whichever way it goes. Now that he has been made a mediator, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar must clarify if he still stands by his statements.Advisability of mediationDespite Hindu groups opposing a negotiated settlement, the Supreme Court made it clear that an attempt should be made to settle the dispute by mediation. It overruled their objections by invoking Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) which allows the court to refer any dispute to one of the four modes of non-adjudicatory resolution processes: namely, arbitration, conciliation, judicial settlement (including settlement through Lok Adalat), or mediation. In this case, the court opted for mediation.Also ReadStrange turn: on SC's order regarding Ayodhya disputeThis was again opposed on the basis of a two-judge Supreme Court judgment inAfcons infrastructure and Ors. v. Cherian Verkay Construction and Ors(2010). It illustratively explained that mediation cannot be done in a representative suit which involves public interest or the interest of large number of persons who are not represented in the court.But the five-Judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi differed. Citing the provisions of Order 1 rule 8 CPC and Order XXIII rule 3-B, it stated that there was no legal impediment to making a reference to mediation. Whether the said CPC provisions would apply in the event parties arrive at a settlement in the mediation proceedings was left open to be decided later.Also, what the Supreme Court had frowned upon inAfconswas a civil court exercising power under Section 89 of the Code to refer a suit for “arbitration” without the concurrence of all the parties to the suit. But the court is free, the Supreme Court had said, to consider and decide upon any non-adjudicatory resolution method other than arbitration such as judicial settlement or mediation.Questions still remain. If the Hindu groups continue to reject mediation, how will this dispute be resolved? And if they agree to negotiate, will the compromise they reach with Muslims be binding on all Hindus in India?Even Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who conceded that a negotiated settlement is most ‘desirable’ in this case, was initially not sure if such a settlement could bind millions of Hindus and Muslims as the issue is not an ordinary dispute between two private parties.Win-win situationIf examined closely, it would be seen that the Babri Masjid dispute is not really an explosive issue affecting the religious sentiments of millions of Hindus and Muslims as has been portrayed. This may have been the case in the initial years after the illegal demolition of the Babri Masjid. But today, more than a quarter century later, such a portrayal should be construed as having entered the realm of political mythopoeia where myths of various kinds are created at the hustings for electoral advantage.The fact is, there is no evidence to show that the handful of parties claiming to represent Hindus and Muslims in this case are fully backed by their respective communities. In other words, the Babri Masjid/Ram Janmabhoomi imbroglio is no longer a life-affirming issue for the Indian masses, who are more concerned about jobs, poverty alleviation and access to affordable housing, health care and education.That said, both communities cannot afford to let the Ayodhya dispute simmer forever and stall the country’s socio-economic growth. The main reason for the unrelenting Muslim attitude is the fear that if they give up their claim on the Babri Masjid, Hindu groups would ask for other “disputed” mosques to be handed over. After all one of the post-demolition kar sevak slogans in 1992 was, “Yeh toh sirf jhanki hai,abKashi, Mathurabaaki hai(This is only the trailer, now Kashi and Mathura remain),” in which Kashi and Mathura are metonyms for two more disputed places of worship.A question of trustIf this Muslim fear is addressed by the Hindu parties to the dispute, and also by influential organisations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the chances of amicably resolving this seemingly intractable conflict would exponentially increase. A collective assurance from the Hindu side that it would not stake claim to any other “disputed” mosque in India could be the face-saving compromise and win-win situation both sides are looking for.A.

Across Baghdad, a moment of respite and guarded hope ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/across-baghdad-a-moment-of-respite-and-guarded-hope/article26496346.ece,,https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Baghdad’s main commercial district has seen more bombings than its residents can count. Death visited almost daily during times of war most horrifically, a 2015 suicide bombing that ripped through two shopping malls, killing over 300 people.But over the past year or so, the residents of Karrada have felt more normal than they have in decades. Streets lined with food stalls are crowded with shoppers, coffee shops and restaurants are packed until late, and the grey cement blast walls that protected against bombings are being removed.“I used to go to school and come back home, nothing more,” said Rusul Mohsen, a 33-year-old middle school teacher, seated recently at a store front sipping coffee. “If I went to a restaurant, I would ask to sit in a corner the farthest away from any windows, fearing a car bomb explosion might shatter the glass.”For the first time in 15 years there is no major war or insurgency in Iraq, and the defeat of the Islamic State group in late 2017 after a ruinous four-year war has given the population a moment of respite. Despite the enormous challenges ahead, there is a guarded sense of hope across the capital.Car bomb explosions that became the norm after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, making the Iraqi capital’s name synonymous with war, have ceased at least for now. Thousands of concrete barriers that snaked through the city as protection from suicide car bombers have been towed away in trucks, easing traffic.Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool said thousands of barriers have been towed away to a plot of land on the outskirts of the city, saying they may be used in the future around Baghdad to protect against infiltration.Parts of the heavily fortified Green Zone on the west bank of the Tigris River have reopened to the public, including public access to the landmark “Victory Arch” a 40-meter (131-feet) tall arch of two swords held by bronze casts of former dictator Saddam Hussein’s hands to commemorate the Iran-Iraq war.The U.S. established the Green Zone in 2003 to secure its embassy and Iraqi government institutions. But the zone became a symbol of the country’s inequality, fueling the perception among Iraqis that their government is out of touch.On the other side of the river, Baghdad’s famous Rasheed Street, the capital’s oldest street and cultural center known for its crumbling, old Iraqi houses, has also reopened for cars and pedestrians after a 15-year closure due to security risks.A new Central Bank headquarters, a towering waterfront building on the banks of the Tigris designed by the late Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid, is currently under construction, expected to be completed next year.“Baghdad feels better than it has since 2003,” remarked a veteran Western diplomat in Baghdad.Even so, the country faces massive challenges.The Islamic State group, which is about to lose its last shred of territory in neighboring Syria, is creeping back in Iraq, stepping up insurgent-style attacks in areas outside Baghdad and the country’s north. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced and much of the country is in ruins. The country is plagued by corruption, and in the oil-rich but parched south, violent riots have repeatedly broken out against living conditions.Baghdad, an ancient metropolis of 8 million people that was once the Arab world’s cultural center, is barely functional, its infrastructure crumbling. Armed militias who fought IS alongside the Iraqi armed forces roam the streets in what many see as the country’s latest menace, amid reports of kidnappings for ransom and general lawlessness. Unemployment, poverty and disenfranchised youth are widespread.“There is a big gap between people’s aspirations and the government ability to deliver,” the Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity so he could speak freely.Still, many hope that after years of bloodshed, Iraq is starting to turn a corner.In Karrada, the Hadi Center where a 2015 suicide bombing trapped people in a burning inferno for hours, killing around 300 people, is full of shoppers and youngsters fill the food court. The adjacent Laith Center had to be razed and rebuilt from scratch. It’s now almost completed.Assem Gharib, owner of a pastries and ice cream shop, said for years he used to pay someone to supervise the street outside his shop and keep cars from parking in front.“I used to be frightened whenever a car approached, imagining it to be a suicide bomber or a car bomb. Now it’s the opposite, we are happy when a car parks in front of the shop,” he said.That kind of confidence eluded most Iraqis for the past 15 years. The country has been at war, one way or another, for more than a generation, starting with the eight-year Iraq-Iran war that ended in 1988, followed by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent military intervention by the United States.The worst bloodletting came with the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which triggered an al-Qaida driven insurgency and sectarian violence that washed over the country, killing tens of thousands of Iraqis. Bombings reached up to 10 a day.The violence culminated with the Islamic State group, an al-Qaida offshoot, seizing Iraqi cities and declaring a self-styled Islamic caliphate over large parts of Iraq and Syria. That triggered a displacement crisis unprecedented in Iraq’s history. Millions fled their homes in the face of the militants’ rapid advance. Others fled as Iraqi forces, backed by the U.S. and Iran, battled back, ultimately reclaiming the last town in late 2017.Few dare to hope the current lull in fighting will last and many worry fear the growing power of the Shiite militias, known collectively as the Popular Mobilization Forces.Bashar Ali, a 33-year-old shop owner on Karrada street, said he fears the return of IS fighters from Syria and the lawlessness outside the city, including kidnappings and killings.“Baghdad is like my home, I feel safe in my own home, but when I go outside I don’t feel this way,” he said."

Supreme Court expresses surprise over Gujarat HC decision in Teesta Setalvad case
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court on Monday expressed surprise that the Gujarat High Court simultaneously granted activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband protection from arrest in a NGO fund embezzlement case while granting the police liberty to seek their custody if they do not cooperate in the probe.“If investigating officer is given liberty for [seeking] police custody and anticipatory bail is granted, can they co-exist? The moment the investigating officer gets police custody, the anticipatory bail goes,” Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi observed orally about the February 8 judgment of the High Court.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Gujarat police, said there were other matters pending in the apex court relating to Ms. Setalvad and her husband and all those could be heard together.Taking note of the submission, the Bench issued notice and tagged the case with the matter in which the couple was accused of embezzlement of funds collected for the victims of the riots of Gulberg society in Ahmedabad.Ms. Setalvad and her husband have denied the allegations and maintained that the State is targeting them for fighting the cause of the victims of post-Godhra riots.An FIR was registered on March 31, 2018 against Ms. Setalvad and her husband for allegedly securing Central government funds worth Rs. 1.4 crore “fraudulently” for their NGO Sabrang between 2010 and 2013."

Analysis: The art of quoting Gandhi

Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi accused each other of sullying the legacy of the Mahatma and working against his principles.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Principal rivals in the 2019 elections, Prime MinisterNarendra Modiand Congress president Rahul Gandhi both cited Mahatma Gandhi to make their political points on Tuesday. The day also marked the anniversary of the historic Dandi March, started by Mahatma Gandhi from Sabarmati Ashram on March 12, 1930.Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Modi accused each other of sullying the legacy of the Mahatma and working against his principles. They both claimed to be working for the fulfillment of Mahatma Gandhi’s vision.Mr. Gandhi said in Mr. Modi’s home turf of Gujarat that the Statehas fostered two differing ideas of India— one represented by Gandhi and the other by his assassin, Nathuram Godse. “On one side is hatred, symbolised by Godse; and on the other side is love, symbolised by Mahatma Gandhi and Gujarat’s heritage. And the victory will be of love, Mahatma Gandhi, brotherhood, Gujarat and the Congress party,"" Mr. Gandhi said.While Mr. Gandhi made his political point bypatching his Congress partyon to the vision, Mr. Modi’stake on Gandhi’s messagewas notable by an omission.“Gandhijisaid that he does not believe in inequality and caste divisions. Sadly, the Congress has never hesitated from dividing society. The worst caste riots and anti-Dalit massacres happened under Congress rule,” Mr. Modi said in a blog, that also accused the Congress of being the antithesis of Gandhian thought.Mr. Modi is certainly right that a lot of caste riots and anti-Dalit massacres did take place on the Congress’s watch. What Mr. Modi did not say is that several riots targeting Muslims also took place during Congress rule. Gandhi did preach brotherhood, but Hindu-Muslim brotherhood was particularly dear to his heart. Mr. Modi thought that was not worth mentioning."

A compromise is still possible

But there is need for clarity on the status of one mediator and the efficacy of mediation on Ayodhya
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court’s attempt to maintain Hindu-Muslim harmony through a mediated settlement of the long-standing Babri Masjid dispute deserves appreciation. But it has raised a couple of concerns too. One relates to the choice of a mediator, and the other to the efficacy of mediation at this stage.Mediator neutralityBy definition, a mediator is a neutral third party who facilitates a negotiated settlement between adversarial contenders. Unfortunately, the neutrality of one of the three court-appointed mediators, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, has come into question as some of his public pronouncements in the recent past appear to negate his supposed disinterestedness.A year ago, in an open letter to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had said: “People from both communities who are adamant on following the court’s verdict are also driving the issue to a situation of defeat.” The “best solution”, therefore, is “an out-of-court settlement in which the Muslim bodies come forward and gift one acre of land to the Hindus who in turn will gift five acres of land nearby to the Muslims, to build a better mosque.”He even told Muslims that giving up their claim to the disputed property did not amount to “surrendering this land to the people who demolished the Babri Masjid or to a particular organisation. On the contrary, they are gifting it to the people of India”.Apart from the fact that this position betrays Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s bias in favour of disputants belonging to one religion, it is difficult to understand the justifiability of treating a gift to Hindus as a gift to the people of India. Does he regard only Hindus as “the people of India” to the exclusion of other communities?Nonetheless, it stands to reason that Muslims would be in a position to gift the land only when their ownership of it is confirmed by the Supreme Court. If Muslims lose the case, the entire land would come under the control of Hindus and the question of Muslims giving up their claim would then be rendered redundant.But the Art of Living founder thinks that even a Hindu victory would not be conducive to peace. It could foster Muslim resentment and may “lead to riots throughout the country”, he told the AIMPLB, thereby insinuating that Muslims are violent. He seems to be unaware that Muslims have agreed to abide by the court verdict whichever way it goes. Now that he has been made a mediator, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar must clarify if he still stands by his statements.Advisability of mediationDespite Hindu groups opposing a negotiated settlement, the Supreme Court made it clear that an attempt should be made to settle the dispute by mediation. It overruled their objections by invoking Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) which allows the court to refer any dispute to one of the four modes of non-adjudicatory resolution processes: namely, arbitration, conciliation, judicial settlement (including settlement through Lok Adalat), or mediation. In this case, the court opted for mediation.This was again opposed on the basis of a two-judge Supreme Court judgment inAfcons infrastructure and Ors. v. Cherian Verkay Construction and Ors(2010). It illustratively explained that mediation cannot be done in a representative suit which involves public interest or the interest of large number of persons who are not represented in the court.But the five-Judge bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi differed. Citing the provisions of Order 1 rule 8 CPC and Order XXIII rule 3-B, it stated that there was no legal impediment to making a reference to mediation. Whether the said CPC provisions would apply in the event parties arrive at a settlement in the mediation proceedings was left open to be decided later.Also, what the Supreme Court had frowned upon inAfconswas a civil court exercising power under Section 89 of the Code to refer a suit for “arbitration” without the concurrence of all the parties to the suit. But the court is free, the Supreme Court had said, to consider and decide upon any non-adjudicatory resolution method other than arbitration such as judicial settlement or mediation.Questions still remain. If the Hindu groups continue to reject mediation, how will this dispute be resolved? And if they agree to negotiate, will the compromise they reach with Muslims be binding on all Hindus in India?Even Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who conceded that a negotiated settlement is most ‘desirable’ in this case, was initially not sure if such a settlement could bind millions of Hindus and Muslims as the issue is not an ordinary dispute between two private parties.Win-win situationIf examined closely, it would be seen that the Babri Masjid dispute is not really an explosive issue affecting the religious sentiments of millions of Hindus and Muslims as has been portrayed. This may have been the case in the initial years after the illegal demolition of the Babri Masjid. But today, more than a quarter century later, such a portrayal should be construed as having entered the realm of political mythopoeia where myths of various kinds are created at the hustings for electoral advantage.The fact is, there is no evidence to show that the handful of parties claiming to represent Hindus and Muslims in this case are fully backed by their respective communities. In other words, the Babri Masjid/Ram Janmabhoomi imbroglio is no longer a life-affirming issue for the Indian masses, who are more concerned about jobs, poverty alleviation and access to affordable housing, health care and education.That said, both communities cannot afford to let the Ayodhya dispute simmer forever and stall the country’s socio-economic growth. The main reason for the unrelenting Muslim attitude is the fear that if they give up their claim on the Babri Masjid, Hindu groups would ask for other “disputed” mosques to be handed over. After all one of the post-demolition kar sevak slogans in 1992 was, “Yeh toh sirf jhanki hai,abKashi, Mathurabaaki hai(This is only the trailer, now Kashi and Mathura remain),” in which Kashi and Mathura are metonyms for two more disputed places of worship.A question of trustIf this Muslim fear is addressed by the Hindu parties to the dispute, and also by influential organisations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the chances of amicably resolving this seemingly intractable conflict would exponentially increase. A collective assurance from the Hindu side that it would not stake claim to any other “disputed” mosque in India could be the face-saving compromise and win-win situation both sides are looking for.A.

T.N. to witness bypoll in 18 Assembly seats

At a press conference, Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo said the by-elections will not be held for Ottapidaram, Aravakurichi and Tiruparankundram Assembly constituencies.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Voters in Tamil Nadu’s 18 Assembly constituencies, where byelection will be held in April, would decide the fate of the Edappadi K Palaniswami-led AIADMK government, which is ruling with a wafer thin majority in the House whose strength has been reduced from 234 to 213.The AIADMK has 114 MLAs, excluding the Speaker, and has to win at least in about 10 seats to remain comfortably in power till the end of its term in 2021.Confusion over dateThere was some confusion over the announcement of bypoll date on Sunday. At separate press conferences in Chennai and New Delhi, T.N. Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo and Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said the bypoll would take place on April 18, along with the Lok Sabha poll in the second phase. However, the document uploaded on the EC website mentioned the date as April 23, but said the polling will be held in the second phase. Officials hinted that the date in the document might be corrected soon.Though 21 Assembly seats are vacant, bypoll would not be held in Tirupparankundram, Aravakurichi and Ottapidaram (SC) as election petitions are pending in court. Post-bypoll, the strength of the House would go up to 231, which means the AIADMK would technically have to win just two more seats to cross the half-way mark of 116. However, with the AIADMK MLAs in Aranthangi, Virudhachalam and Kallakurichi joining the T.T.V. Dhinakaran camp, and two others elected on the ‘Two Leaves’ symbol — Thamimun Ansari and Karunaas — turning against the government, the ruling party has to win as many seats as possible.Also, the byelection to the remaining three seats would be held eventually when the court settles the issue or if the petitioners withdraw their case. Considering that 17 of the 18 constituencies (except Thiruvarur) where bypoll would be held were won by the AIADMK in May 2016, it will also be a test of popularity for the ruling party.Both the AIADMK and DMK have obtained a commitment from their respective allies that they would extend support to them in the byelection.While 18 of the 21 constituencies had fallen vacant following the disqualification of dissident AIADMK MLAs; Thiruvarur and Tirupparankundram fell vacant after the death of M. Karunanidhi (DMK) and A K Bose (AIADMK). In Hosur, a vacancy was created due to the disqualification of former Minister Balakrishna Reddy following his conviction in a rioting case. The byelection will be held in Poonamallee, Perambur, Thiruporur, Sholingur, Gudiyatham (SC), Ambur, Hosur, Pappireddipatti, Harur (SC), Nilakottai (SC), Thiruvarur, Thanjavur, Manamadurai (SC), Andipatti, Periyakulam (SC), Sattur, Paramakudi (SC) and Vilathikulam.To a query, Mr Sahoo said the Election Commission (as reported inThe Hinduon October 27, 2018) had clarified that the disqualified AIADMK MLAs can enter the fray for the Assembly by-elections."

Power and communications outages continues to hit Venezuela
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Venezuelan Opposition and government loyalists held rival demonstrations in Caracas on Saturday, as both sides prepared for what some fear could be a protracted power struggle.The rallies unfolded as power and communications outages continued to hit Venezuela, intensifying the hardship of a country paralysed by economic and political crisis. The blackouts heightened tension between the bitterly divided factions, which accused each other of being responsible for the collapse of the power grid.“Hard times are ahead,” said Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who addressed crowds with a loudspeaker after security forces earlier dismantled a speakers’ stage that the Opposition had erected. He said he planned to tour Venezuela to seek support and lay the groundwork for a massive rally in Caracas.The 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly said he anticipated more government efforts to sideline and intimidate the Opposition. However, President Nicolas Maduro’s government has not moved directly against Mr. Guaido since he returned to Venezuela from a Latin American tour Monday.Mr. Guaido earlier speculated that Mr. Maduro was effectively ignoring him in an attempt to sap the energy of the Opposition, whose hopes of ousting the government have so far been stymied.But on Saturday, Mr. Maduro stepped up verbal attacks on Mr. Guaido, calling him “a clown and puppet” in a speech to supporters outside Miraflores, the Presidential palace. He scoffed at Mr. Guaido’s claim in late January to be interim President of Venezuela, a declaration supported by the United States and about 50 other countries.“Not a President, not anything,” said Mr. Maduro, who accused Mr. Guaido and his U.S. allies of sabotaging Venezuela’s Guri Dam, one of the world’s largest hydroelectric stations and the cornerstone of Venezuela’s electrical grid.The Venezuelan Opposition and U.S. officials say Mr. Maduro’s attempts to pin blame on his political adversaries is absurd, and that government corruption and mismanagement over many years caused the blackout and wider deterioration of the economy.Explosion at power stationIn another blow to Venezuela’s infrastructure, an explosion occurred at a power station in the country’s Bolivar state on March 9, according to local media. Video posted on social media showed fire and smoke billowing from the site.

| Photo Credit:Getty ImagesNetblocks, a non-government group based in Europe that monitors internet censorship, said Saturday that the second outage had knocked out almost all of Venezuela’s telecommunications infrastructure.Earlier, it referred to online connectivity data indicating that the initial outage that began Thursday and eased about 24 hours later was the largest on recent record in Latin America.Managers of the Caracas subway said they were waiting for the electricity supply to stabilise before resuming service, and the power grid problems quickly became only another issue that galvanised Venezuelans to take to the streets.Hyperinflation and shortage of basic necessitiesOpposition protesters who converged on Avenida Victoria in Caracas vented anger over the country’s problems, including hyperinflation and shortages of basic necessities. They pushed against the shields of riot police who avoided a clash by withdrawing from the area.Some protesters elsewhere in the city said police tried to block them from reaching the rally, creating a sense of confusion as power and communications outages plagued the country.“This is chaos,” said Jorge Jaimes, a physician frustrated with the decline of a country that was once the wealthiest in Latin America.At the pro-government rally, people danced and waved flags on what organisers labelled a “day of anti-imperialism” in a show of defiance toward the United States, which has imposed oil sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to oust Mr. Maduro. Many showed up wearing red caps and shirts in support of the self-proclaimed “socialist revolution” of leader Hugo Chavez, who died six years ago and was succeeded by his protégé, Mr. Maduro."

Poll in 3 seats delayed by court case
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"On April 18, when Tamil Nadu votes in the Lok Sabha elections, voters in 18 Assembly constituencies, where byelections will be simultaneously held, would decide the fate of the Edappadi K Palaniswami-led AIADMK government that is ruling with a wafer thin majority in a House, whose strength has been reduced from 234 to 213.The AIADMK has 114 legislators, excluding that of the Speaker, and has to win at least in about 10 seats to remain comfortably in power till the end of this government’s term in May 2021.Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo told journalists on Sunday that though 21 Assembly seats were vacant, bypolls will not be held in Tirupparankundram, Aravakurichi and Ottapidaram (SC) constituencies as election petitions filed by individuals are pending in court.In the immediate future, post-bypoll, the strength of the House would go up to 231, which means that the AIADMK would technically have to win in just two more seats to cross the half-way mark of 116. However, with the AIADMK legislators in Aranthangi, Virudhachalam and Kallakurichi joining the TTV Dhinakaran camp and two other legislators elected on the ‘Two Leaves’ symbol — Thamimun Ansari and Karunaas — turning against the government, the ruling party has to strain every nerve to win as many seats as possible to retain power.Also, the byelection to the remaining three seats would be held eventually when the court settles the issue or if the petitioners withdraw their case.

FIR registered to intimidate us, say organisers of November 2018 protest
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The adivasi farmers’ protest march from Thane to Mumbai in November last year, has become a bone of contention between the Mumbai Police and the Loksangharsh Morcha, which organised the march.According to members of the Loksangharsh Morcha, the Azad Maidan police have registered an FIR against them to intimidate them. Firoz Mithborwala, an organiser, said, “We were served notices by the Azad Maidan police on Tuesday, in the middle of a press conference that we had organised to voice our questions regarding the Pulwama and Balakot attacks. This is an attempt to intimidate all activists who support the struggling farmer, and all those asking questions that challenge the official version of the events in Pulwama and Balakot.”The notices issued to Mr. Mithborwala, Smita Salunkhe, Afroz Mallik, Ravi Bhilani, and Jyoti Bandekar stated that an FIR was filed against them on November 23, a day after the march, for unlawful assembly, attempting to overawe the government by criminal force, or show of criminal force and wanton provocation with intent to cause riots under the Indian Penal Code. It also stated that all the five activists will need to be arrested.“The police have asked us to come to court on March 22. Adivasis and farmers are standing with us. The march was completely legal and the State government even arranged for special trains to take protesters back to their hometowns. Why, then, have the police suddenly termed it unlawful?” Mr. Mithborwala asked.The police, however, said that the protest march was in violation of the law and that the FIR was legally justified. “There are guidelines laid down by the Honourable Bombay High Court that forbid a protest march on foot through the city. We had clearly communicated to theorganisers that they could protest at Azad Maidan but not march through the city, which they ignored.

A peek into the wounded soul ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/a-peek-into-the-wounded-soul/article26456065.ece,"
Baapu”, a sensitive play directed by Bhanu Bharti, captures Mahatma Gandhi’s principled opposition to the proposal of the Partition of the country
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Bharatendu Natya Utsav, organised annually by Sahitya Kala Parishad, Government of Delhi, has acquired a significant place in the theatre world of the Capital in which the best productions of the year are featured. This year’s Utsav opened with the specially invited production of “Baapu” which was staged by Aaj Rangmandal at the Kamani Auditorium as a part of the celebration of the 150 birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.Written by renowned Hindi playwright Prof. Nand Kishore Acharya, recipient of Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Baapu unfolds like a long lyrical poem evoking intensely melancholic mood, replete with tragic musings. It reveals multiple layers of the wounded soul of Mahatma Gandhi towards the close of his life who is bitter by the betrayal of his followers in his quest for the creation of a spiritually powerful Indian society, strong enough to be the true practitioners of Satya and Ahimsa. The focal point of the play is the troubled inner world of Gandhi and out of which emerges the dichotomy between the great ideals of non-violence once followed by his followers with sincerity and their present opportunism for the lust after political power. The synthesis of expressive theatrical elements into artistic whole stirs the soul of the audience.Nehruvian philosophyThe directorThe play is directed by Bhanu Bharti, one of the pioneers of contemporary Indian theatre, who has several landmark productions of different genres to his credit . His philosophical vision is influenced by the Nehruvian era and his artistic credo is inspired by Gavari, a community theatre form of Bhils of Udaipur, Rajasthan and the Japanese classical theatre Noh and Kabuki.Over the years, he has evolved his own form to reflect deep antagonism in contemporary Indian society. In the production, what one discerns is his insight into what lies beneath the surface and to interpret the historical context in which Gandhi stands alone while the country is passing through turmoil and witnessing communal carnage. He undertakes fast for communal harmony and for ensuring safety for Muslims.Recalling BoseSolo in structure, the play is replete with historical references. In the play, the character of Gandhi refers again and again to Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose, the Muslim League and Mountbatten. The core of the production is Gandhi's principled opposition to the proposal of the Partition of the country. He is vehemently opposed to the proposals of the Cabinet Mission. He is sad that Nehru, Patel and Azad are following the plan of the Partition conceived on the basis of communalism. He feels that the top Congress leadership is close to Mountbatten while keeping him in the dark about the Partition. At several places, he declares that the country will only be divided on his dead body. He believes that the Congress leadership should be handed over to the younger generation and suggests the name of Narendra Dev but to his utter dismay his proposal is rejected outright.At the hour of his utter alienation, he recalls Subhas Chandra Bose whose candidature for the Congress President he had opposed tooth and nail. He says Subhas's men of Azad Hind Fauj came to his help to bring about peace and stop communal carnage. He recalls with pain that those whom he once considered his followers in the quest for truth and non-violence have done little to stop communal riots and instead they move out in police protection. Had they been Satyagarhi, they would have died in the cause of communal harmony and non-violence. He realises that his firm belief in non-violence, truth and call for communal harmony will enrage a section of Hindus and is obsessed with fanaticism as they are. They will kill him and this will be the death of a Satyagarhi who embraces death for the cause of Ahimsa and Satya.The play opens in a room with scanty objects-a bed, a small stool, a candle and at some distance a chair and charkha are kept. The emptiness of the space indicates solitude in which the protagonist has confined himself. Gandhi is alone, talking to himself. In the second half there is no bed, Gandhi sits on the floor. His alienation from the top leadership of the Congress has acquired an ominous air. Towards the end, we hear three gun shots and ‘Hey Ram’. The lights fade out.Realistic styleLighting by seasoned lighting designer R.K. Dhingra is highly ingenious. To create the right ambience, he has mostly used mood lighting and haze machine. Through lighting design, a black curtain is projected upstage, displaying a window on the wall. Only the movements of the performer are provided with a light that makes them clearly visible and most of the space is dimly lighted to reinforce the gloomy mood to reflect the isolation of a life inspired by great ideals.Teekam Joshi, a graduate from National School of Drama and one of the outstanding stage actors, is superbly cast in the role of Gandhi. He acts in a realistic style with restraint, imparting tremendous emotional tension to the portrait, revealing the inner turmoil of his character and truly living his life – indeed a memorable performance."

The vision of the World Handmade Textile Biennales just got the push it needed at the unveiling of the refurbished Handloom Haat with the support of the Asian Heritage Foundation
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is significant that Handloom Haat, the government’s brick-and-mortar endeavour to create a centre for textile craft and heritage, is on Janpath — ‘the people’s path’. Because the idea is to connect the weaver with us, the people who have the power to change a livelihood into a profession. To keep our living heritage alive in a changing world.“The idea is to start linking people to their histories and legacies,” says Sujata Prasad, who retired as an Additional Secretary from the Ministry of Culture. She now serves as an advisor to the Crafts Museum. She leads me through the exhibition, bringing every piece alive.Some are from her own collection (like the kalamkari piece that tells the complete Ramayana), several from the Crafts Museum (like the phulkari) and from mastercraftsmen themselves (like Rohit and Rahul Salvi’s silk patan patola). Each piece is well-labelled and tells us a little about the craft, the piece, and details of the weaver.The exhibition itself is divided into five zones: Chintz, Ikat, Embroidery, Brocade, and Khadi. Each will, in the future, evolve into a different biennale in the area from where it originates: the World Khadi Biennale in Ahmedabad (December 2019), Brocade in Varanasi (September 2020), Ikat in Hyderabad (June 2021), and Chintz in Jaipur (March 2022), Embroidery in Srinagar (November 2022). At the exhibit, the idea is also to connect similar craft forms from across the world. Each section has maps indicating where else the craft is practiced — there is Ikat in Indonesia and Turkmenistan, for instance.Weavers, designers, buyers from apparel and interiors spaces, and technologists, will all be a part of it. “It is a destination event,” says Ramesh Prasanna, cultural entrepreneur and Director — International Alliances, Government Interface and Media, from the Biennales team. He calls it textile and cultural tourism, which, like the Kochi Biennale will have different elements scattered across the city.Prasad, who is an advisor to the Biennale, of which the Asian Heritage Foundation is the custodian, is looking forward to collecting the ‘smaller’ histories — the narrative of the bigger traditions is known and has been told, she says. But a family that sings its own song as it weaves, will now be able to give the world a glimpse not just of the cloth, but also of the lives they lead.At the exhibition, you will find a double-ikat telia rumal wall hanging with 100 non-repetitive motifs a bright orange Chettinad saris in natural dyes, along with pieces from textile researcher Rta Kapur Chishti’s personal jamdani collection and much more. It’s not just the old though; there are contemporary pieces and motifs too, and weavers have experimented with fabrics they hadn’t traditionally used.In the midst of it all, there are three of craftsperson Sarojben Rathore’s patchwork pieces that provide context to life as she’s seen in it:‘The Earthquake in Gujarat’, ‘Gujarat Communal Riots’, ‘A Life in an Ideal Village — Gojul Gaam’.The exhibition is brought together, though perhaps unwittingly, by a khadi pieces that cover the bright lights overhead. There’s more of the material draped over the large windows, shielding the pieces from harsh sunrays.Through his five decades of work in culture, Rajeev Sethi, — the founder-chairperson of the Asian Heritage Foundation and a Biennale mentor — says he’s been concerned that handmade may be subsumed in the onslaught of machines and fakes. “If one really wants to be a conscious consumer, one must appreciate the effort that has gone into evolving these traditions…We need to understand why an ikat is pre-loom, a brocade is on the loom, and that chintz or embroideries are post the loom,” he says. The Biennale is just a beginning."

In conversation with the Chief Minister who just completed 1,000 days in office
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Pinarayi Vijayan, the Chief Minister of Kerala, just completed 1,000 days in office. During this time, his government faced some unprecedented challenges such as the floods in 2018 and the implementation of the Supreme Court order to allow young women to visit the Sabarimala temple. In this interview, Mr. Vijayan speaks of those challenges and his government’s development agenda.Excerpts:Kerala has witnessed one of the worst floods in its history in 2018. What’s the present status of rebuilding activities? How long it will take to complete the rebuilding process?The reconstruction bid is really a mammoth and unparalleled task. It will take two-three years to complete the task. During the floods, we gave priority for rescue operations and relief activities. We were able to rescue more than 1,63,000 people from August 17 to 20. Around 1.5 million were shifted to around 4,000 relief shelters across Kerala. The State government has provided, for 700,000 families, ₹10000 rupees each as immediate financial assistance.Today, we are mainly focusing on the reconstruction of damaged houses and roads. A total of 13,362 houses were fully damaged in the floods. The first installment of financial assistance has been distributed for the reconstruction of 9,341 houses. The cooperative sector will rebuild 2,000 houses. The government has identified and sought support of sponsors for the construction of rest of the houses.A total of 1,075 landless families have lost their houses in the flood. We have identified suitable land for them. In the flood 2,42,602 houses were partially damaged. Among these, 1,21,265 beneficiaries have got the first financial installment... I am hopeful that we will complete this process before the end of this financial year.Did Kerala get necessary help from the Union government for the post-flood rebuilding?The actual loss incurred by the State in the flood amounts to ₹31,000 crore. This is equal to the total amount of the annual plan of the State. But according to the criteria of the Union government, we are eligible to ask for just ₹5,000 crore. Even this amount is not allocated for us. It also remains that we are not allowed to accept the volunteer help offered by the foreign countries. Our Ministers are denied permission by the Union government from visiting non-resident Malayalees to raise fund for reconstruction. The State government also hasn’t got any written permission from the centre to raise our borrowing capacity.The implementation of GST and other policies have really curbed the financial autonomy of State governments. The situation also doesn’t not exist to raise our own tax revenue. Today, we need a real rethinking of central-State economic relations in the direction of assuring enough resource allocation and economic assistance for the States. It is only then that our federal structure would work in a manner suiting the interests of both the Central and State governments.How do you look at the whole Sabarimala agitation? There were allegations that the government failed to consider the sentiments of the devotees while implementing the Supreme Court order...From the beginning itself the government’s position is that it would uphold the principles of the Constitution and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The State has submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court, stating that whatever may be the court verdict, the government would abide by that and would implement it. So it is the fundamental responsibility of the State government to implement the verdict. Look at the initial response when the verdict came; everybody including the AICC [All India Congress Committee], the Opposition leader [in Kerala], BJP State president and the RSS have all accepted it. Some people even called it a historical judgment. They also said, even before me, that the government has legal obligation to implement it.Unfortunately, after this, the same people started openly challenging our Constitution. Their ultimate aim was to disturb and malign Kerala’s secular mind and orchestrate a religious riot. Even those who claim themselves as the champions of secularism fell in that trap. But the people of Kerala realised these things and stood firm in the spirit of secularism. People at large kept themselves restrained and resisted the efforts to orchestrate religious riot in the state.A large number of devotees don’t favour the entry of women in the menstruation age into Sabarimala. Do you think your government has succeeded in communicating your position on this issue with the larger section of society?Different Left governments holding office before the High Court verdict of 1991 never tried to prevent the entry of menstruating women into Sabarimala. In the same way, Left governments never acted in opposition against the High Court verdict of 1991, which restricted the women entry. The most important thing to remember is that the Communist party was never part of the legal discourse on this issue. It was actually the devotees themselves who approached the honourable judiciary to either ban the women entry or lift the restriction. After the Supreme Court verdict, we have consistently said that it is not the job of our party or the state government to ‘recruit’ women to Sabarimala.On the other hand, we have taken a clear stand that it is the duty of the State government to give necessary protection for anybody who visit Sabarimala based on the Supreme Court verdict and their individual faith. We have seen massive participation of general public, including women, in the LDF’s political meetings on the Sabarimala issue. We have also seen huge participation of women belonging to different faiths in the “women’s wall” for gender justice. All of this shows that we have been successful in communicating our stand with the common people.How effective was your government’s response in maintaining law and order in the wake of protests and frequent hartals over the Sabarimala issue?The government has taken strict action against the perpetrators of violence across the State. Protest has even reached to the level of throwing bomb at a police station. Media persons were also brutally attacked. Most of the culprits arrested in these cases are Sangh Parivar activists. The most bizarre thing that we see today is that the same Sangh Parivar organisations campaigning that devotees should not do any offering to temples including Sabarimala are on a fund collection drive to deal with their cases. In Kerala, they tried to use the same technique they practice in other parts of the country.This is the technique of orchestrating religious enmity and riot in order to garner political gains. But Ayappa devotees themselves and the people of Kerala at large have realised their motive now. We should not forget the fact that the same time when these forces were engaged in violence in the name of Sabarimala, the pilgrimage was going on smoothly.The BJP leadership has officially conceded and confirmed that they are winding up their protest due to lack of enough support. It means that they failed to achieve what they aimed at. This defeat of Sangh Parivar is a result of the collective resistance shown by the people of Kerala.What is your take on the argument that the restriction on women’s entry in the Sabarimala temple is part of religious custom? How do you view the Supreme Court judgment?The renaissance movement and social reformers have taught us that superstitious beliefs and customs should be challenged and opposed. Modern Kerala is a product of the selfless social service of great visionaries. The nation’s Constitution is supreme and above all, the customs and beliefs. In the verdict, the Supreme Court has clearly spelled out that any violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution can’t be allowed. All governments, come into power based on the constitutional principles, are obliged to uphold the constitution as supreme.The Left government is into its third year. How do you assess the government's performance?We have actually announced a 35-point programme and succeeded in completing most of them in time. The basic emphasis was on the development of infrastructure. The GAIL pipeline project, the LNG terminal, Kochi Metro, Water Metro, National water way, Kannur International Airport, Vizhinjam port, Hill Highway and coastal highway projects are some of the major projects we have concentrated on.Four flagship missions (Ardram, Life, Haritha Keralam, Public education protection drive) launched by this government are implementing with success. As part of this, we can see a major jump in educational and health sectors. Before we complete our term in office we will provide home for every family in Kerala. No one will remain homeless.Our effort is to create enough jobs in our State itself for the qualified and educated youth. In order to achieve this goal, we are utilising the opportunities in the IT filed. The government is also taking measures to create new jobs by strengthening the public sector and the traditional sector. The amount of social welfare pensions increased as highest rate in the country level .This could be emulated by other States also.In a historic move we have appointed, for the first time, Dalits and other backward caste people as priests in the Devaswom Board-owned temples. I would like to add that the Kerala government has done more than any government could do in 1,000 days. In the coming days our main focus will be on post-flood rebuilding and also on production and industrial sector.The Left generally talks about and aim at an alternative development path. As Kerala is the only Left ruling State now, could you talk about the alternative policies you could introduce?When the central government tries to disinvest the public sector enterprises, we try to empower them. We have been successful in making the public sector enterprises under Kerala government profitable within one year after coming into power. Along with this, we are taking over public enterprises which are disinvested by the Central government in Kerala. When the Central government try to privatise the education sector, the schools in Kerala have been upgraded as the best in the country.When the central government withdraw from the social sector, the Kerala government actively intervened in social welfare measures and also provide social welfare pension at the highest rate in the country.Newspapers report that the number of jobs created has decreased in the country after [Narendra] Modi came to power. But in Kerala, our government gave appointment to 1 lakh youngsters through the public service commission. We also created 20,000 new posts in the same period.Our government has also succeeded in increasing wage and other benefits in more than 80% of the labour sector. We could also implement a Bill giving employees the right to sit and work, intervened in raising the salary of nurses and also intervened in the plantation sector. The four missions that we have set up basically aim to bring structural changes with an alternative development outlook.On January 1, Kerala saw a 627-km long Women’s Wall. What was the reason behind the government’s decision to have such an event?It was not actually the government’s decision to organise the women wall. Instead, the idea emerged in a meeting of different community and progressive organisations convened by the State government. Immediately after the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala, there was a dangerous and regressive effort, in the name of custom and belief, to tarnish the progressive achievements of Kerala. Against the court verdict of upholding gender equality, there were efforts to bring in public women and claim themselves as impure. Gender and caste-based defamation reached into the level of violent attacks.There took place incidences of attack, in public, against women. These events necessitated organised resistance against these forces. It was in this context that the State government initiated a meeting of progressive organisations. In this meeting, representatives of 170 organisations participated and the idea of women wall emerged. The basic objectives of women wall were the slogans of protecting renaissance values, ensuring gender equality, not allowing Kerala to become a lunatic asylum. Kerala wholeheartedly welcomed this initiative and around 5.5 million women joined in the wall from Kasaragode to Thiruvananthapuram.The CPI(M) is in favour of reservation for economically backward classes among the forward castes. The other argument is that economic reservation is against the spirit of our Constitution. What’s your take?Reservation is necessary in the Indian context in order to empower the historically marginalised castes. At the same time, there are thousands in the general category too who face economic difficulties. Reservation for the socially backward castes should be continued as such. But relief should be provided for economically backward sections of the upper castes.The Supreme Court has maintained that reservation should not cross the 50% mark. We can’t accept any move from any quarter that would reverse the constitutionally guaranteed reservation. Such efforts would result in enmity between different communities or even result in clashes between communities.Introducing reservation for economically weaker sections of the general category should not affect the existing reservation. In the appointments to the posts under Travancore Devaswom Board, we have ensured that it would not affect reservation of the existing communities or violate the 50% cap.Aggressive right-wing nationalism registers significant growth in different parts of the world. In India too we see such an upsurge or emboldening of such forces. How the organised Left would resist this?The Kerala society maintains a unique secular mindset. This secular social formation is a result of numerous struggles led by the communist movements and other progressive forces. Because of this historical legacy, Kerala still keeps away these right wing forces. Discredited with having no popular support in society, they try to show their might and influence people through their muscle power. We have seen violence and aggression in the Sabarimala protests. But unlike other States, the Hindu rightwing forces were not able to gain much influence in Kerala due to the strong resistance offered by the Left.In a pan-Indian context, the communist movements and the Left pursue many folded battles against neo-liberalism and communalism. It is because of this strong stand on these two fronts that we are continuously targeted and attacked by the ruling classes in different parts of the country. In West Bengal and Tripura, you could see it in open eye. Recently, CPI(M) leader Brinda Sahni who was in the frontline of land struggles in Bihar was brutally killed by those who protect the interests of the landlord classes. All this shows that we pose a real political challenge to the communal forces in the country.You talked about creating employment opportunities? Has your government succeeded in creating enough jobs for the State’s youth?The principle aim and policy of this government is to create enough employment opportunities for the educated in Kerala itself. It is in tune with this aim that our government involves in IT and other sectors. As part of this, around 2,000 new start-ups have begun operation after this government came to power. We have a policy of using science and technology for social progress and human welfare. The prospects of health, tourism, etc. in job creation is also being explored.We are making a new jump in the production of electrical vehicles. Materialisation of the Virology Institute and Life Science Park opens up new possibilities based on knowledge. Making profitable the public enterprises and reviving the traditional industrial sectors have increased job opportunities in the State. We have also got a strong cooperative sector. The possibilities of increasing the productivity of agriculture and fisheries sector also offer opportunities for the State.The agriculture sector was one of the main areas to focus on post-flood rebuilding. How do you deal with the challenges agriculture faces?Our objective is to attain self sufficiency in agriculture. We have launched Harita Keralam mission as part of this. We were moving into self-sufficiency in the field of milk, vegetable and egg production. Unfortunately, the havoc caused by the flood stalled our efforts in this direction. Heavy rainfall and flood caused structural changes in the soil character. So we need detailed a study of these issues before beginning cultivation. We have launched an action plan to protect the biodiversity. Flood level is also digitally marked.On the basis of this, we could start production activities suitable for our environment. Along with the objective of increasing agricultural production, we also aim to increase the scope for agricultural related business activities in the State. We have great scope for value addition and processing of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish etc. This will ensure more income for the farmer.It is the wrong trade policies of the central government which cause for price collapse and international competition. Removing import restrictions on rubber caused for huge slash in its price for domestic farmers. The Union government didn’t take any action in the direction of creating price stability fund for rubber. But in our State, we have created such a fund worth of ₹500 crore. The fall in pepper price is also a result of such wrong policies pursued by the Central government.The Lok Sabha election is on the door step. How do you analyse the political situation? What is your party’s main agenda in this election?We have a situation in the country where the BJP and the RSS try to crumble the basic edifice of our country. The assault on constitutional bodies and autonomous institutions is unprecedented. We have a situation where four senior judges of the Supreme Court came out against interventions in the functioning of the apex court.We also know what is happening with the CBI. It is a serious matter that an autonomous body like the Central Vigilance Commission played a part in the Central government’s intervention in matters of the CBI. In higher education institutions and research institutes, people without enough qualification and people with complete obedience to the ruling establishment are appointed.Myths are being presented as science and facts become causality. Even the right to privacy of the individuals is breached. So in this context, the coming election assumes much significance in protecting the basic idea of India.The current government is one of the most anti-people governments in the history of this country. Minorities, Dalits, peasants, students, writers, working class have suffered the worst consequences of the Modi government. They have turned into active protest against this government. The general sentiment in the country is now against the BJP and the RSS. Recent assembly elections and bye-elections in different States show that. The same will be reflected in the coming election too.As far as the CPI(M) is concerned, our primary aim is to defeat the BJP. Both the BJP and the Congress are equally enthusiastic about implementing neoliberal policies in the country. If you look in this way, then we could understand that two parties are both sides of the same coin. Both these parties also use communal sentiments in different ways and degrees. The BJP pursues communal politics more aggressively and also, as they are led by the RSS, there is great danger of fascism involved in their politics. Because of this, our primary aim is to defeat the BJP. For which we will adopt political tactics according to the prevailing political situation in each State.For the Left, politics is a way of conducting ideological struggles. We could build a better world only through such struggles. Our political activities have been oriented towards this objective. It is the communist parties and Left movements which have led the struggles of peasants, workers and students in the last years.These struggles have really influenced in shaping popular mood against the RSS and the BJP. We have also registered electoral success in places where we are able to widen and consolidate our support base through these struggles. So we are very confident about the future.Don’t you think that the coming general election will also be a test of your government in Kerala?The Lok Sabha election is an opportunity to evaluate the Union government and also the national politics. I have already explained what the State government has done for the people of Kerala. The people have realised from their experience the difference between present Kerala and what was the situation two and a half years ago.In the same period, we have also actively involved in checking regressive efforts aimed at backtracking the achievements of the State. Along with maintaining the progressive nature of society, we have also succeeded in maintaining people’s unity. So the people of Kerala know well about which political force is leading Kerala towards progress. Because of this, we are confident and hopeful about the election result.Jipson John and Jitheesh P.M are fellows at Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research"

‘Initially, when the Sabarimala verdict came everybody accepted it. Unfortunately, later the same people started openly challenging our Constitution’
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Pinarayi Vijayan, the Chief Minister of Kerala, just completed 1,000 days in office. His government faced some unprecedented challenges, such as the floods in 2018 and the implementation of the Supreme Court order to allow young women to visit the Sabarimala temple. Mr. Vijayan speaks of those challenges and his government’s development agenda. Excerpts:Kerala witnessed one of the worst floods in its history in 2018. What is the status of rebuilding activities?During the floods, we gave priority to rescue operations and relief activities. We were able to rescue more than 1,63,000 people from August 17 to 20. Around 1.5 million were shifted to around 4,000 relief shelters across Kerala. The State government has provided, for 7,00,000 families, Rs. 10,000 each as immediate financial assistance. Today, we are mainly focussing on the reconstruction of damaged houses and roads. A total of 13,362 houses were fully damaged in the floods. The first instalment of financial assistance has been distributed for the reconstruction of 9,341 houses. The cooperative sector will rebuild 2,000 houses. The government has identified and sought support of sponsors for the construction of rest of the houses. I am hopeful that we will complete this process before the end of this financial year.How do you look at the whole Sabarimala agitation?The State submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court, stating that whatever may be the court verdict, the government would abide by that and would implement it. So it is the fundamental responsibility of the State government to implement the verdict. Look at the initial response to the verdict; the AICC, the Opposition leader, BJP State president and the RSS all accepted it.Unfortunately, after this, the same people started openly challenging our Constitution. Their ultimate aim was to disturb and malign Kerala’s secular mind and orchestrate a religious riot.Many devotees don’t favour the entry of women in the menstruation age. Do you think your government has succeeded in communi-cating your position?The most important thing to remember is that the Communist party was never part of the legal discourse on this issue. It was actually the devotees themselves who approached the honourable judiciary to either ban the women entry or lift the restriction.

De Gea's career crossroads a danger to Man Utd's revival

In the four seasons before De Gea signed, Alex Ferguson's side reached three Champions League finals. In the seven seasons since, United have made the quarter-finals just once and look likely to fall short of the last eight once more.Thibaut Courtois's arrival at Real appears to have closed the door to a move to Madrid.However, PSG and Italian champions Juventus are reportedly interested and could offer De Gea the guarantee of Champions League football – while United battle just to make the Premier League's top four once more – as well as a better chance to compete in the latter stages unless big changes are made at Old Trafford.Solskjaer hailed De Gea as “the best goalkeeper in the world” this week as he pleaded with him to commit his future to the club.The Norwegian has lifted the mood of players, staff and fans with is affable nature off the field and much improved results on it, making him the front runner for the manager's job on a full-time basis.

‘Politics has touched a new low; YSRCP bent on denting reputation of the State’

How can the YSRCP file a complaint against the IT firm?

From Sena’s complaint, Section 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) has been dropped.Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I, Sudhakar Pathare, said, “When we scrutinised the videos, we did not find any evidence supporting the claims made by the complainants. The sections of rioting, assault and gathering crowd still remain in both cases. We have submitted a report to the court on why those sections are not relevant in the case.”Mr. Pathare said as per Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in case of cognisable offences, police officers have to write down the complaint as mentioned by the complainant. “In the further course of investigations, the investigating officer has the right to add or drop sections as per the findings. For a charge like attempt to murder, a motive has to be there. A person who has welcomed another by bursting fire crackers a few minutes prior won’t be attempting murder. Even in case of outraging the modesty, nowhere in the videos did we see any such act,” Mr Pathare said.In the cross complaints filed by the two parties, Airoli corporator M.K. Madhvi of the Sena and other party workers were accused of attempting to murder and deterring NCP MLA Sandeep Naik’s bodyguard from discharging his duty, while Mr. Naik and NCP Mayor Jaywant Sutar were accused of outraging the modesty of Mr. Madhvi’s wife.“The Madhvi family is absconding and hence have not been arrested,” Mr. Pathare said.

The strangest wars in history
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/the-strangest-wars-in-history/article26434172.ece,"
Wars, unless fought for ideals such as freedom, liberty and justice, are usually a waste of valuable resources and time. In modern times, we have seen battles being fought for essentials such as water. And then, there are battles that have been fought for the strangest of reasons - such as the ones listed here. Let’s see what they were fought for.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Battle of the IceHazard a guess: was this battle fought over ice cubes? Did two countries fight to conquer an icy region? Or did they use ice to fight it?The Battle of Ice is named thus because it was fought on a frozen lake. Lake Peipus, which lies between Russia and Estonia, was picked as the battleground for a fight that was religious in nature. The Teutonic Knights, a Catholic group, invaded Russia to convert Orthodox Christians. Approximately 10,000 to 12,000 knights were warring on the icy lake. The Knights were kept at bay by the Russians, led by Alexander Nevsky. Folklore associated with this battle suggests that several knights, during battle, had been pushed to the western shores of the lake where the ice was thin. Several knights are said to have been dragged to the bottom of the freezing lake, thanks to the heavy armour they wore.Russia still adheres to Orthodox Christianity while Estonia remains Catholic and Protestant in its religious leanings. A futile battle, indeed!The Pastry WarThe Mexican War of Independence liberated Mexico from Spain’s dominion in 1821. For several years after that, the tension between the government and the rebels led to ugly street fights, rioting, ransacking and looting on the streets of Mexico. Plenty of shops and businesses were reduced to rubble. One such shop was a bakery that belonged to Monsieur Remontel, a Frenchman. Remontel demanded an astronomical 60,000 pesos as compensation for his bakery. Because Mexico refused to even acknowledge his complaint, Remontel chose to approach the French King Louis-Phillipe directly. The French, already fed up of trying to get Mexico to pay its mounting debts, demanded 6,00,000 pesos as compensation and a separate payment of 60,000 pesos for Remontel’s bakery. Incidentally, the bakery had been valued at less than 1,000 pesos. Mexico, as usual, ignored the missive. France then blocked-off sea trade with Mexico. Angered by this move, Mexico declared war against France and The Pastry War began. It lasted four months. Britain secured peace between the two warring factions and ensured that Mexico paid the amount of 6,00,000 pesos to France and also compensated Remontel for his bakery.Wars might have been fought for several juvenile reasons, but this one sure takes the cake!The War of the Oaken BucketBloodshed was common in Europe during the medieval ages. It could have the silliest of triggers—such as the stealing of a wooden bucket.Italy, which was not a unified country in the medieval period, included groups that were at loggerheads because of their religious beliefs. One such group, the Ghibelline, believed that the King was the representative of God on Earth, and therefore, deserved to be worshipped. Another group, the Guelphs believed that the Pope had crowned the King, and was, therefore, above the King in hierarchy.Modena, a city in northern Italy, was Ghibelline and Bologna, a city 30 miles away, was Guelph. Once, soldiers from Modena sneaked into Bologna and disappeared with a wooden bucket full of loot. Bologna was enraged—not only had they been stolen from, their pride had been attacked.To recover their stolen riches and the bucket (and some amount of pride), Bologna declared war on Modena. It was not an equal war. Bologna’s army that was almost six times larger than Modena’s. Yet, within two hours, they were routed.A replica of the bucket hangs in Modena even today!The Pig WarIn the most benign of all the wars mentioned here, the only irrecoverable loss was the life of a pig.In 1859, the U.S. and Britain were fighting over borders. The San Juan islands were the particular bone of contention between the two. As it happened, a pig owned by British Hudson Bay company strayed into a potato farm owned by American farmer Lyman Cutlar and did the thing that pigs do - it ate and ate and ate. The farmer tried complaining to local authorities and when they took no action, he shot the pig. This single bullet brought the two countries to war. Almost.As it happened, neither side really wanted a war. It took several years, but they finally decided where they wanted to settle on the island as well. The British occupied the northern part of the island while the Americans settled in the southern part.If you think these wars were silly to the point of being hilarious, maybe the next time you are fighting with your friend or sibling about erasers, sharpeners, socks and such, you might want to pause and think. Are you unknowingly triggering the War of Wet Socks?"

‘Where have my groves gone?’
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/where-have-my-groves-gone/article26422157.ece,"
The unique pantheistic art form of the Theyyam faces increasing threats of gentrification and Brahminisation, thus paving the way for the destruction of the sacred groves where it was born
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"There’s a lake underneath the forest where a crocodile runs riot.Thus goes a myth about one of Kerala’s sacred groves, and it’s a myth that is firmly believed by the people who inhabit the area around the grove. And aspects of the myth colour the local Theyyam performed there.There has always been an unmistakable umbilical link between the dance form of Kerala called Theyyam and nature. A Theyyam is a ritualistic performance where pantheistic deities are summoned to the body of the performing man, one who is almost always from a subaltern community. Each of these instances of “possession” is rooted in a unique local myth, which in turn is rooted in the ancient sacred groves of Kerala calledkaavu. Eachkaavuis a small rainforest, and these were in abundance in the State until some years ago.In an extraordinary play between culture and nature, the grove nurtured the dance form and the dance form was instrumental in arresting the destruction of the groves even when development and modernity came knocking. Theyyam’s accoutrements have always been drawn from nature — such as garlands and decorations of ripe areca nuts, flowers, leaves and fruits — just as the biodiversity-rich wilderness of the groves has been the home of the pantheistic deities that thrived in the Malabar region.Spirit-worship, ancestor-worship, tree-worship, animal worship, serpent-worship, the worship of the goddesses of disease and the worship of theGraamadevataor village god, all are part of the Theyyam cult, which is a folk religion for millions. The number of major deities surviving now is about 100, while the number of Theyyams is more than 400.The ritualistic art form is ancient, predating organised Hinduism and harking back to a time of tribal animism. Over the years, Hindu elements have been slowly taken in and adapted to the ritual. This might well have enriched it but might also spell the death knell for a certain vital attribute of the Theyyam.Complete faithIt was always a symbiotic relationship. The deities — goddesses in most part and hereditarily embodied by designated men from specific communities — towered over a feudal society with its undivided landholdings. The land and the dance and the myths nurtured each other. The people of the region had complete and sanguine faith in the god or goddess who presided over the region, and the sacredness attached to the deity was extended to the grove, thereby giving it a protective cover.The hereditary nature of the Theyyam has meant that each custom and traditional practice is carefully protected, fostered and handed over. At a recent performance, for instance, of the Karimchamundi Theyyam at the Tharanthatta Karimchamundi shrine in north Malabar, Naranthan, a veteran performer, spoke appreciatively of how the younger generations after him even today reverently observe every custom before transforming into the theyyam.My village in north Malabar has akaavu. The presiding theyyams — Kadayankathi and Pethalan — inhabit the perennial darkness of the dense woods, entertaining a particular fondness for the mysterious hours of dusk or high noon. None dared disturb the sacred groves at these times, unless it was to request an exorcism.The aloof magnificence of Kadayankathi and Pethalan obscured their myths and origin stories, but the devout knew they had unmediated access to these deities when they manifested as theyyams during the days of the ritual.Missing the woodsOn a recent trip to thekaavuto pay respects to the theyyam during their annual visit, I was dismayed to find that the surrounding forest had all but disappeared. When I commented on this, a neighbour remarked, completely missing the irony, that the theyyam would have more room to perform if the forest was cleared further.When the Theyyam was a sacred ritual, its performance was in the nature of an offering to the deity. And the forest, the deity’s domain, was the performance space. Slowly, over the years, as the Theyyam has increasingly been marketed as a tourist attraction, it has become less ritual and more entertainment. This has meant that the dance aspect of it has taken precedence over the space and indeed over the sacred itself. And the recognition of Theyyam’s deeply symbolic character has begun to give way to an understanding of it merely as an art form. This, in turn, has impacted the sanctity of the forests orkaavu, and they are cut down carelessly.Besidesthe ecological consequence of such a development, a second threat looms large over the pantheistic origins and identity of Theyyam. A gradual Brahminisation has uprooted the primal spirits from the rock and the wood of the sacred groves they used to inhabit. Unlike Brahminical temples, thekaavufeatures no priestly rituals or lighting of lamps during non-Theyyam times. And the rituals are performed by the people themselves, not by priests. Thus, the sacred grove remains closed for most of the year, which allows the wilderness to grow back. The theyyams, however, are now lodged in brick-and-mortar temple structures outside the sacred grove — and worshipped through rituals unfamiliar to the elemental deities, and their favour is mediated by the priestly classes. The evicted theyyam takes with it the sacral protection extended to the grove.From grove to templeA grove located in Kasargod district in North Kerala — the Periya Bhagavathikaavu— illustrates the changes occurring in and around all of Kerala’s sacred groves. Kaliyattam (one of many kinds of ritual Theyyam) had ceased for several years at this grove, which was situated on a property owned for generations by a feudal lord. At the insistence of the villagers, the ritual was revived. The villagers consulted an astrologer for advice on the rituals to be followed. The astrologer divined that the gods and goddesses were cramped inside the confines of the sacred grove. The only solution was their re-consecration in a temple complex outside the grove. A priest was given the charge of invoking the favour of the gods and the village celebrated the consecration with an annual Kaliyattam.And thus thekaavufaded from the Periya Bhagavathikaavu, and it is certain to become the Periya Bhagavathi ‘temple’ in no time. This story is not restricted to Periya Bhagavathi, but has recurred across sacred groves all over North Kerala. You have to look no further than Nandapuram Sreekrishna Temple, where the Vishnumoorthi Theyyam and the Gulikan Theyyam hold annual performances. Unsurprisingly, a recent consultation with the astrologer again revealed that the Theyyam ritual itself ought to be replaced with more conventional Brahminical temple rituals to obtain divine favours. Like thekaavu, will the ritual performance too fade or morph into something else? Only time will tell.Meanwhile, the theyyam that has for so long watched over the land and its denizens must come to its own rescue. The Brahminisation and the loss of the sacred grove have not escaped the notice of the theyyam, I observed. During a recent performance, the Kadayankathi bellowed at the village elders: ‘Where have my groves gone?’ The answer perhaps lies in a question the Pethalan posed during the performance to his gentrified cousin, Palenthayi Kannan (originating from a local myth, but whose identity is now subsumed by the Narasimha avatar of Vishnu). “Did you christen me Kaatumoorthi (primitive forest deity) because you found the name Pethalan uncouth?” he asked.(The photos featured here are part of a project called Lost Wilderness that won the India Habitat Centre Photosphere Award last year.A selection is on display atIndia Habitat Centre,New Delhi,till March 18.)Being godTraditionally, clans set up shrines in akaavuon their land, where the Theyyam deity would appear once a year or even once in12 yearsThe practice goes back to the agrarian society of a time when clan heads held much of the land aroundThe performers belong to subaltern communities like Vannan, Velan, Malayan, etc.The rituals are different from Brahminical ones, often involving blood sacrifices or walking on embersIt’s an open-air performance in front of the forest shrine that can go on for hoursThe costumes and face-painting are extraordinarily elaborate, and art forms in themselves. The extravagant headgear called mudi can even be 50-60 ft highMusical instruments include chenda, tudi, kuzhal, ilathalam and veekniAs the dancers spin and twirl to the frantic drums, they enter a state of trance before collapsing. It takes a while for them to revive, after which devotees seek their blessingsWhen the Theyyam was a sacred ritual, its performance was in the nature of an offering to the deity. And the forest, the deity’s domain, was the performance spaceTheyyam is ancient, predating organised Hinduism and harking back to a time of tribal animism. Over time, Hindu elements have been slowly adapted to the ritual"

Tune in tothe twitter ofwinged visitorsin your neighbourhood
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is the time of the year when Nature is at her vibrant best and one cannot miss the vibrant hues all around as well as the fragrance of fruits and flowers in the neighbourhood. More than the riot of colours, there is one other element that would catch your attention, especially during the early hours of the day – the chirping and tweeting of birds that are out in search of the proverbial early worm. What is more important is — you don’t have to go far and wide to spot them – you can find a good majority of them in your own backyard!One of the nostalgic memories that most of us carry from our childhood days is that of listening to the song of the Asian koel. It is usually delivered as a duet. With the advent of the mating season (March-August) you cannot miss them — the male which almost resembles a crow, except for the pale green / grey beak and dark red eyes and the female aptly called as ‘pullikkuyil’ in Malayalam thanks to its beautifully speckled body. While the mating call is a musical sound, koels have a large repository of sounds, ranging from shrill angry tones to alarmed tones, which they make at the sight of crows or other threats.Musical tonesWhen you speak of musical tones, the name that first comes to the mind is the bulbul. While you may find the red vented bulbuls occasionally, it is the Red-whiskered bulbul that is sighted more often in the urban areas. The tall pointed black crest, red face patch and thin black moustachial line give it an elegant look and you can find them in lightly wooded areas, bushes and shrubs. They are often found feeding on fruits and small insects.Rufous treepie is another common resident found in our backyard. They add a dash of colour with their cinnamon-coloured body and the white patch across the feathers as well as wings.If you have flowers around your home, especially shoe flower, you would be hearing the unmistakable twitter of sunbirds. Purple-rumped sunbirds are small, colourful birds that are less than 10 cm in size and as typical of most of the birds, the male of the species is more beautiful with its green metallic crown and shoulder patch. You will often see them hanging on branches and pecking at the base of large shoe flowers. Two other smaller species that you can find in your neighbourhood are the common tailor bird and the Pale-billed flowerpecker. Tailor birds are famous for their nests made by ‘sewing’ leaves together.It is time to look out for two of the noisy, yet colourful species of birds — Rose-ringed parakeet and the lesser Goldenback- or Black- rumped flameback woodpecker. Rose-ringed parakeet gets its name from the black and rose ring that the male bird has and you will find them nibbling away at ripe guavas, mangoes and other fruits as well as grains like paddy. Black-rumped flameback is the most commonly found woodpecker in urban areas and announces its presence with loud, shrieking calls. While the male bird has a red crown and crest, the female has a black forecrown with red only on the rear part of the crest.When you talk about noise and chatter, you cannot avoid the most common of all species — the crows and the mynahs. Crows are territorial as well as fearless — quite often you will see them chasing black kites, which are almost three times their size and successfully guarding their turf. Mynahs on the other hand are boisterous with a wide range of sounds in their repertoire.

Uncharacteristically middling fare is the downfall of Sonchiriya’s soundtrack, says Vipin Nair ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With the exception of his last film – the crime drama from 2016,Udta Punjab– director Abhishek Chaubey has always handed the composing duties for his films to Vishal Bhardwaj. InSonchiriya, the pair reunites, though without lyricist Gulzar – Chaubey retains Varun Grover from hisUdta Punjabcrew for this one. Last year, was kind of a mixed bag for Bhardwaj, with a few memorable songs among the two movies he did, but also a bunch of mediocre ones. Let’s see if he’s bounced back withSonchiriya.Monotonous vocalsA Twitter friend made an observation last week (before the release of Sonchiriya’s music) about the pattern that Vishal’s soundtracks have fallen into of late – in terms of the choice of genres and singers – which has made the prospect of a new album from the veteran less exciting of late. It’s unfortunate, thatSonchiriya’s soundtrack pretty much sticks to Vishal template for most part. The song where that monotony has the most detrimental effect is the folksy dance track sung by Sukhwinder Singh and Rekha Bhardwaj, ‘Naina Na Maar’. While Singh’s singing reminds of you of the multiple similar numbers that he’s rendered, even Rekha sounds out of sorts, and not just in this song. Singh’s other song is a better affair – ‘Saanp Khavega’ has great potential, marked by powerful lines from Grover, and a momentous, almost eerie orchestration (Budapest Film Orchestra at work). But sadly, the end product falls short of anything worth writing home about.‘Ruan Ruan’ checks the “pensive melody” box, formerly handled by the composer himself but taken over by Arijit Singh in recent soundtracks. This is however a case where the quality of the song lifts it above the déjà vu aspect, to make it a winner. Arijit is in good form, delivering Grover’s neatly written verse, but it is the arrangement – the guitars (Ankur Mukherjee, Dhruv Visvanath and bassist Saurabh Suman) interspersed with that whistle hook shadowing the ‘Ruan Ruan’ refrain – that really drew me to the song.Unrealised potentialAnother number that had the making of a terrific piece, but doesn’t quite get there is the title song. The composition is something of a surprise to begin with – a gentle, lullaby-ish cadence at complete odds with the fierceness that dominated the film’s promos. The interlude features a lovely classical-flavoured solo on the guitar (played almost like a slide guitar) by Chintoo Singh. It’s the vocals that let the song down – Rekha sounds better here than she did in ‘Naina’, but is still nowhere close to her best.The Budapest Film Orchestra joins in the party in the song’s reprise version and the backdrop gets more elaborate. The singing though, disappoints yet again, but I will take this version for the sweeping instrumental passages by the orchestra. This version of the song occasionally takes me back to the composer’s brilliant ‘Shaaradendu’ that he composed for the Malayalam movieDaya(1998).‘Baaghi Re’ is the track that actually feels like the film’s theme song. The rock-flavoured arrangement follows along the lines of other songs in the genre, that Vishal has created in the past, except with a touch of the Wild West in keeping with the film’s Chambal settings. The decision to hand vocal duties to the folk powerhouse Mame Khan helps escape the tedium to an extent, as he brings in his brand of improvisations to the rendition. The song has another version, and given the current trend, it’s a welcome change to have the remix in the same album. The Groove Room Producers’ spruced-up arrangement, is nicely done, though I prefer the touch of hinterland in the original.Sonchiriya’s album is uncharacteristically middling fare from Vishal, that feels particularly ordinary coming on the back of two recent soundtracks –Gully Boyin Hindi andKumbalangi Nightsin Malayalam, both of which are exceptional."

As Kerala’s sacred groves disappear, the Theyyam art form loses a vital link
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/as-keralas-sacred-groves-disappear-the-theyyam-art-form-loses-a-vital-link/article26417293.ece,"
The unique pantheistic art form of the Theyyam faces increasing threats of gentrification and Brahminisation, thus paving the way for the destruction of the sacred groves where it was born
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"There’s a lake underneath the forest where a crocodile runs riot.Thus goes a myth about one of Kerala’s sacred groves, and it’s a myth that is firmly believed by the people who inhabit the area around the grove. And aspects of the myth colour the local Theyyam performed there.Also ReadThey said she was only a womanThere has always been an unmistakable umbilical link between the dance form of Kerala called Theyyam and nature. A Theyyam is a ritualistic performance where pantheistic deities are summoned to the body of the performing man, one who is almost always from a subaltern community. Each of these instances of “possession” is rooted in a unique local myth, which in turn is rooted in the ancient sacred groves of Kerala calledkaavu. Eachkaavuis a small rainforest, and these were in abundance in the State until some years ago.In an extraordinary play between culture and nature, the grove nurtured the dance form and the dance form was instrumental in arresting the destruction of the groves even when development and modernity came knocking. Theyyam’s accoutrements have always been drawn from nature — such as garlands and decorations of ripe areca nuts, flowers, leaves and fruits — just as the biodiversity-rich wilderness of the groves has been the home of the pantheistic deities that thrived in the Malabar region.Spirit-worship, ancestor-worship, tree-worship, animal worship, serpent-worship, the worship of the goddesses of disease and the worship of theGraamadevataor village god, all are part of the Theyyam cult, which is a folk religion for millions. The number of major deities surviving now is about 100, while the number of Theyyams is more than 400.The ritualistic art form is ancient, predating organised Hinduism and harking back to a time of tribal animism. Over the years, Hindu elements have been slowly taken in and adapted to the ritual. This might well have enriched it but might also spell the death knell for a certain vital attribute of the Theyyam.Complete faithIt was always a symbiotic relationship. The deities — goddesses in most part and hereditarily embodied by designated men from specific communities — towered over a feudal society with its undivided landholdings. The land and the dance and the myths nurtured each other. The people of the region had complete and sanguine faith in the god or goddess who presided over the region, and the sacredness attached to the deity was extended to the grove, thereby giving it a protective cover.Garlands and decorations for Theyyam always come from nature — flowers, leaves and fruits.  
| Photo Credit:Thulasi KakkatThe hereditary nature of the Theyyam has meant that each custom and traditional practice is carefully protected, fostered and handed over. At a recent performance, for instance, of the Karimchamundi Theyyam at the Tharanthatta Karimchamundi shrine in north Malabar, Naranthan, a veteran performer, spoke appreciatively of how the younger generations after him even today reverently observe every custom before transforming into the theyyam.My village in north Malabar has akaavu. The presiding theyyams — Kadayankathi and Pethalan — inhabit the perennial darkness of the dense woods, entertaining a particular fondness for the mysterious hours of dusk or high noon. None dared disturb the sacred groves at these times, unless it was to request an exorcism.The aloof magnificence of Kadayankathi and Pethalan obscured their myths and origin stories, but the devout knew they had unmediated access to these deities when they manifested as theyyams during the days of the ritual.Missing the woodsOn a recent trip to thekaavuto pay respects to the theyyam during their annual visit, I was dismayed to find that the surrounding forest had all but disappeared. When I commented on this, a neighbour remarked, completely missing the irony, that the theyyam would have more room to perform if the forest was cleared further.When the Theyyam was a sacred ritual, its performance was in the nature of an offering to the deity. And the forest, the deity’s domain, was the performance space. Slowly, over the years, as the Theyyam has increasingly been marketed as a tourist attraction, it has become less ritual and more entertainment. This has meant that the dance aspect of it has taken precedence over the space and indeed over the sacred itself. And the recognition of Theyyam’s deeply symbolic character has begun to give way to an understanding of it merely as an art form. This, in turn, has impacted the sanctity of the forests orkaavu, and they are cut down carelessly.Besides the ecological consequence of such a development, a second threat looms large over the pantheistic origins and identity of Theyyam. A gradual Brahminisation has uprooted the primal spirits from the rock and the wood of the sacred groves they used to inhabit. Unlike Brahminical temples, thekaavufeatures no priestly rituals or lighting of lamps during non-Theyyam times. And the rituals are performed by the people themselves, not by priests. Thus, the sacred grove remains closed for most of the year, which allows the wilderness to grow back. The theyyams, however, are now lodged in brick-and-mortar temple structures outside the sacred grove — and worshipped through rituals unfamiliar to the elemental deities, and their favour is mediated by the priestly classes. The evicted theyyam takes with it the sacral protection extended to the grove.From grove to templeA grove located in Kasargod district in North Kerala — the Periya Bhagavathikaavu— illustrates the changes occurring in and around all of Kerala’s sacred groves. Kaliyattam (one of many kinds of ritual Theyyam) had ceased for several years at this grove, which was situated on a property owned for generations by a feudal lord. At the insistence of the villagers, the ritual was revived. The villagers consulted an astrologer for advice on the rituals to be followed. The astrologer divined that the gods and goddesses were cramped inside the confines of the sacred grove. The only solution was their re-consecration in a temple complex outside the grove. A priest was given the charge of invoking the favour of the gods and the village celebrated the consecration with an annual Kaliyattam.Worship of ancestors, trees, animals, serpents, are all part of the cult.
 
| Photo Credit:Thulasi KakkatAnd thus thekaavufaded from the Periya Bhagavathikaavu, and it is certain to become the Periya Bhagavathi ‘temple’ in no time. This story is not restricted to Periya Bhagavathi, but has recurred across sacred groves all over North Kerala. You have to look no further than Nandapuram Sreekrishna Temple, where the Vishnumoorthi Theyyam and the Gulikan Theyyam hold annual performances. Unsurprisingly, a recent consultation with the astrologer again revealed that the Theyyam ritual itself ought to be replaced with more conventional Brahminical temple rituals to obtain divine favours. Like thekaavu, will the ritual performance too fade or morph into something else? Only time will tell.Meanwhile, the theyyam that has for so long watched over the land and its denizens must come to its own rescue. The Brahminisation and the loss of the sacred grove have not escaped the notice of the theyyam, I observed. During a recent performance, the Kadayankathi bellowed at the village elders: ‘Where have my groves gone?’ The answer perhaps lies in a question the Pethalan posed during the performance to his gentrified cousin, Palenthayi Kannan (originating from a local myth, but whose identity is now subsumed by the Narasimha avatar of Vishnu). “Did you christen me Kaatumoorthi (primitive forest deity) because you found the name Pethalan uncouth?” he asked.Rooted in the soil: Haridasan at his village of Mangattuparamba in Kannur districtMan to goddess: Haridasan getting his face painted using organic colours for the ritual performance of Neeliyar Bhagavathi Theyyam, also known as Kottathamma.Fitting all elements: Haridasan comes out from the aniyara (green room) to the sacred grove to wear the headgear.The full complement: The Theyyam in full gear.Divine presence: The Theyyam walking through the sacred grove to the main sanctum where the ritual performance takes place.The big arena: The Theyyam in the main ritual area.Back and forth: The Theyyam performance of the day over, Haridasan returns to the aniyara (green room) to shed his divine persona and get back to being human.$(document).ready(function(){

Go bird watching in your backyard

Tune in to the twitter of winged visitors in your neighbourhood
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is the time of the year when Nature is at her vibrant best and one cannot miss the vibrant hues all around as well as the fragrance of fruits and flowers in the neighbourhood. More than the riot of colours, there is one other element that would catch your attention, especially during the early hours of the day – the chirping and tweeting of birds that are out in search of the proverbial early worm. What is more important is — you don’t have to go far and wide to spot them – you can find a good majority of them in your own backyard!One of the nostalgic memories that most of us carry from our childhood days is that of listening to the song of the Asian koel. It is usually delivered as a duet. With the advent of the mating season (March-August) you cannot miss them — the male which almost resembles a crow, except for the pale green / grey beak and dark red eyes and the female aptly called as ‘pullikkuyil’ in Malayalam thanks to its beautifully speckled body. While the mating call is a musical sound, koels have a large repository of sounds, ranging from shrill angry tones to alarmed tones, which they make at the sight of crows or other threats.When you speak of musical tones, the name that first comes to the mind is the bulbul. While you may find the red vented bulbuls occasionally, it is the Red-whiskered bulbul that is sighted more often in the urban areas. The tall pointed black crest, red face patch and thin black moustachial line give it an elegant look and you can find them in lightly wooded areas, bushes and shrubs. They are often found feeding on fruits and small insects.Rufous treepie  
| Photo Credit:Madhava C KurupRufous treepie is another common resident found in our backyard. They add a dash of colour with their cinnamon-coloured body and the white patch across the feathers as well as wings.If you have flowers around your home, especially shoe flower, you would be hearing the unmistakable twitter of sunbirds. Purple-rumped sunbirds are small, colourful birds that are less than 10 cm in size and as typical of most of the birds, the male of the species is more beautiful with its green metallic crown and shoulder patch. You will often see them hanging on branches and pecking at the base of large shoe flowers. Two other smaller species that you can find in your neighbourhood are the common tailor bird and the Pale-billed flowerpecker. Tailor birds are famous for their nests made by ‘sewing’ leaves together.Rose-ringed Parakeet  
| Photo Credit:Madhava C KurupIt is time to look out for two of the noisy, yet colourful species of birds — Rose-ringed parakeet and the lesser Goldenback- or Black- rumped flameback woodpecker. Rose-ringed parakeet gets its name from the black and rose ring that the male bird has and you will find them nibbling away at ripe guavas, mangoes and other fruits as well as grains like paddy. Black-rumped flameback is the most commonly found woodpecker in urban areas and announces its presence with loud, shrieking calls. While the male bird has a red crown and crest, the female has a black forecrown with red only on the rear part of the crest.When you talk about noise and chatter, you cannot avoid the most common of all species — the crows and the mynahs. Crows are territorial as well as fearless — quite often you will see them chasing black kites, which are almost three times their size and successfully guarding their turf. Mynahs on the other hand are boisterous with a wide range of sounds in their repertoire. Sometimes you will also find Jungle mynahs, characterised by the tuft of hairs on the forehead, in wooded areas and open agricultural lands next to urban areas.White throated Kingfisher  
| Photo Credit:Madhava C KurupIf you happen to see a flash of blue followed by a loud, whirring call, you have located the White-throated kingfisher in the locality. One of the least shy species, they are often found in the open. The Greater Coucal or crow pheasant is a large bird which is shy and darts for cover at the sight of humans.As the sun makes it way to call it a day, you would see the black drongos and bee-eaters get into the thick of action.

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Sadio Mane and Virgil van Dijk both struck twice as Liverpool demolished Watford 5-0 to stay ahead of a charging Manchester City at the top of the Premier League on Wednesday.Jurgen Klopp's men calmed fears over their staying power following a recent dip in form as they chase down their first top-flight title since 1990.Defending champions City finally broke the resistance of West Ham at the Etihad Stadium in the second half to stay just one point behind Liverpool, while third-placed Tottenham slipped to a damaging 2-0 defeat at Chelsea.Arsenal remain fourthArsenal swatted aside a limp Bournemouth team 5-1 to remain in fourth place, one point clear of Manchester United, with Romelu Lukaku taking advantage of the absence of Marcus Rashford to score twice in a 3-1 win at Crystal Palace.Liverpool came into their match after three draws in four league matches but Mane settled their nerves early, heading home a cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold before the pair teamed up again, with the Senegalese forward producing an audacious back-heel strike.Divock Origi extended the lead midway through the second period and defender Virgil van Dijk netted twice late on to complete the rout.“The boys showed how much they enjoy the game and the situation,” a delighted Klopp told the BBC.City dominated possession in a one-sided first half at the Etihad but were frustrated by Manuel Pellegrini's tenacious West Ham side.But Sergio Aguero broke the deadlock for City from the penalty spot in the 59th minute, with the spot kick awarded after Felipe Anderson brought down Bernardo Silva.Kepa Arrizabalaga was dropped by Maurizio Sarri as the Blues' goalkeeper paid the price for his refusal to be substituted during Sunday's League Cup final.Chelsea broke the deadlock in the 57th minute when Cesar Azpilicueta fed the ball to Pedro, who slotted past Hugo Lloris and they doubled their lead when Kieran Trippier accidentally passed the ball into the back of his own net.

Beyond bread and butter
",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/beyond-bread-and-butter/article26352315.ece,"
An account of a time of throbbing pain and acute realisation of what’s going on around you
",,"My father always said dogs can perceive omens. It was incredible as a child for me to believe this, whenever I would offer a dog a biscuit or a chapati, and it would devour it greedily and would later rub itself against my leg and lick my feet. It was unusual to imagine that abilities of such mythic proportions would be at the disposal of an order of creatures we consider incapable of freedom from instincts. As it turns out, their instincts would often lead them to bark at certain shifty individuals. They would certainly bark at the other people in my chawl, especially outsiders — save Chacha.Chacha has been delivering pao bread, butter, eggs, lozenges and other confectionery items in our chawl for as long as I remember. I remember seeing him standing at the threshold, holding his old white cement sack, that still somehow faintly bore the name of the company, while my father would answer him and take our usual share of one packet of pao and four eggs for one day. I remember seeing him with his thick black beard as a child and remembering the tale of the Kabuliwala, except that Chacha was a frail looking man all along but had a certain vitality and energy to him that my puny comprehension could never locate. He cycled to our chawl each day. When it rained, which was almost as certain as Chacha’s punctuality, we could see him in his yellow tarpaulin raincoat with the goods covered with a white plastic sheet. Even the rainbow-coloured fan that whirled around did not move then as the contradictory winds and the downpour just made it confused and cease all motion.Time passed and I began answering the door, the number of paos doubled while two more eggs added to our share. Chacha occasionally brought along his son to familiarise him with us and the nearbytenements, so that he could soon replace him. Chacha was getting old. He already had lost most of his teeth to his habit of tobacco, and I could see a discernible limp in his gait and a hunch in his posture, which made the sparsity on his dome all the more conspicuous. His beard was losing its jet, and was streaked with strands of inevitable grey.I remember his son as a likeable kid, but I only ever saw him as a young urchin with the same brilliance in his eyes as Chacha, confident, and probably ambitious, often carrying a toy aeroplane with him. He was well-mannered too, for when my father gifted him some money or some of my old clothes at Diwali or Holi, he would thank him and touch his feet — an honorable gesture.Perennially, when I took the parcel of eggs from him, the wrapping paper bore an article from the pen of Dada Rao. I am almost certain that Chacha was older than Dada Rao. Dada Rao has been a timeless icon of our people’s strength and resilience against foreigners and aliens. My childhood was replete with patrikas and pamphlets of Dada Rao, commanding his followers to rally with him in his battles against injustice and exterior attempts at subordination. Dada Rao was a superhero to me in my youth. There were comics of his exploits, where he would frequently cross the border to teach our wicked neighbours a lesson, and often he would beat and parade butchers and sweepers because they had slaughtered or consumed cow. Often these characters resembled Chacha in their appearance.My father once told me at breakfast that Chacha and his “ilk” were living here on our land. “His kind will be severely punished by Dada Rao. You just wait and see when he comes into power,” he muttered while he took a bite of a toasted pao. Mother was cooking eggs and the smell filled our small two-room apartment.“These people have grown too proud. What do you think? Huh?”“He is just a kid. Spare him your tea chatter. What then will you blabber on about with your friends if you blurt it all out at breakfast?” chuckled mother.“He is the future of our community. Don’t lecture me on how to raise my son,” retorted father as he sipped his tea. “Beta, you need to learn thisas soon as possible for your own good. These people are not your friends. They are only here to multiply, and make this land as our neighbouring country and several others only a few thousand miles away.” I was looking down at my plate, but father had not ended his expostulation.“See, these people are so proud and smug. Look at them! They serve us, live at our pleasure and have the audacity to smile at our faces and allow their kids to play with ours!”His speech had a marked acquaintance to my judgment. I believe I had seen it on TV in one of Dada Rao’s election rallies. I remember millions there, jumping up at his every word, clapping, shouting, jeering when he admonished the current government for the sorrowful conditions in which our community lives. I remember seeing women, old and young, clutching at their little babies or holding the hands of their children, crying and howling when Dada Rao declared that he will protect them against the lustful foreigners. These words and images were engraved on my impressionable mind, almost as if the very hammer and nail that were the insignia for Dada Rao’s party were the weapons that were used to do so.Time was a visitor as always, and Dada Rao’s party won with a remarkable majority. He nominated a respectable and rather agreeable looking fellow from his party as the Chief Minister. I can distinctly reminisce of those days. A band had paraded throughout the city with dhols and cymbals, drums and blaring speakers, announcing to every living soul and each of the dead that Dada Rao, their pious and just leader, was here finally — a second coming of a mythical deity as it were — to deliver his people from the clutches of slavery and ignominy.A local convoy of supporters had reached our chawl that day. I remember them on their loud Yamaha bikes with thumping engines, saffron bands on their heads, smearing saffron gulal on each other’s faces. The elders remained planted on the balconies and windows, smiling and cheering them on. The women clapped and beat their utensils. The dogs barked. All of my friends went out to join them in their celebration, and I did so too.We danced, we laughed and we shouted slogans. It was an initiation, an acceptance into a world I had admired from afar, and now I was submerged in it. The saffron consumed me, assimilating my existence into it, giving me an identity, an association, and in return, I gave it myself. I was not one now but many. We were together in our joy and in our quest for independence. I was saffron. The sheer bliss I felt made me forget that I was hungry. I could not have breakfast that day since Chacha had not come.We had to manage our supplies for the next couple of weeks, after which Chacha resumed his services. He was still his same sombre but lively self, but I often thought I noticed a dissimilarity between the Chacha of old and the one who came to our house now. I thought I saw a shame in his eyes, the dissident vitality of old replaced by a meek submissiveness. Often when he did not have change, he would say he will settle it the next day. However, now he would run around the building and bring the change back to us. There were other curious changes too. When I would answer the door having just prayed bearing a tika on my forehead, he would not look up. He would silently nod, hand me the paos and eggs and walk away, stuffing the money hastily and often carelessly into the pockets of his kurta, invariably spilling coins in the corridor and earning a curse or two from the residents.Soon Chacha stopped coming altogether and was replaced by his son, as he would have intended.His son had grown into a confident young man. He was sprightly, and the bounce in his step helped me envision a younger, chattier Chacha on the same bicycle — one that was unafraid just like his son. His garrulous charm had resisted the onslaught of adolescence and won over the people of the chawl, which he frequented in the evening when he played cricket with us. He was liked by the dogs too, and often let out a packet of biscuits and paos for them. He had told me his mother had passed away so Chacha looked after the shop. This was easier for his aging eyes too, while he was in charge of delivery and pickups. He had to give up his education because of it, but he said that he planned to continue it in a few years. The aeroplane was still on his mind.And so the needles of the clock went on until they were halted by another thud on my remembrance.It was a pleasant morning, the rising sun spilled the first of its already decaying orange light through the window in its absurd routine, while mother served me tea. December had set in and following a healthy monsoon, it was getting a little chilly. The mosque had fallen a few days ago, and riots had broken out all over the city. Our locality was largely untouched and the paos and eggs were coming regularly.Mother was preparing father’s lunch while he bathed. The smell of frying onions and their sibilance was interrupted by a ruckus outside. I heard distant drumming and frightening roars, a loudness matched only by the deafening detonation of bombs from old war documentaries. I was shaken out of my comfortable reverie and jumped to a window.I could see no one and dismissed it all as another one of the zealous celebrations of my fellows of their victory over history. The dogs barked ceaselessly as they always did when they drummed maniacally, but a shoo or a stick made the stupid beasts scamper away yelping in terror.I sat down to sip my tea when I heard a woman’s shriek, shrill almost like a girl’s, shriller than the clang of swords on shields, piercing my ears like a pacing javelin, hurting. I ran up to the window again and saw the horde of celebrators had reached the compound of the chawl. They were gathered round in a circle and shouting slogans while a few women stood a comfortable twenty or thirty yards away with an incriminating, almost baneful look on their face, holding a girl, sobbing and screaming. It was her voice that had made me jump up. She beat her head and her chest, her hair had been undone, the kohl from her eyes bled into her face, besmirching it with the harrowing semblance of an inevitability, a fear-driven humiliation that had sauntered on to her face which I had never seen before. She was the daughter of a resident.All this while the men’s faces ranged from apoplectic paralysis to haughty jeering and chuckling. They brandished wooden sticks, almost as thick as the boughs of the asoka. They shouted slogans of “justice” and “revenge”. Excited at this raucous commotion, I went down, leaving the tea to cool with the rising sun.By the time I got into the compound, the crowd had started moving. The girl let out another wail that left me shaken in my steps, but I walked on.I could see rags which were oddly familiar, red stains and some saffron gulal where the horde had stood. I ran up to join them, unmindful of the fact that I was now accompanying them in raising the same slogans. There were some of my friends at the back of the crowd, still too young for a voter identity card, but they goaded me on relentlessly. I followed the crowd to the exit gate of the chawl, where I was followed by the barking dogs, which looked on helplessly, mewling and shaking.I looked on, bemused and perplexed when it dawned on me. I stood there frozen, afraid, and disgusted. My mind was an infinitely contorted maze of ideas, and memories. I was too late.Cries of hapless anguish filled the silent winter air. The smoke rose into the heavens, not at all what his God had wanted. I had never known the smell of burning flesh, and now I wish that I could forget it. The crowd cheered on while he danced with fiery death and rolled on the wet road that gave him no aid. He rolled and rolled and rolled but to no avail. It went on for some time. I looked at it the whole time.He lay there, wriggling like a worm. It was soon over; petrol burns fast. His cries were gone. The smoke was gone. The winter morning consumed them, hid them from discovery, but failed in front of the charred mass.The crowd scattered, spitting and clapping, raising the same slogans they had raised all morning. The girl still cried. I returned to my home. Mother asked no questions, packed my father’s lunch who went out to the shop.The paos and eggs stopped coming. We welcomed the new year, and the riots continued for some more time.I have to go out in the evenings now to get the paos and eggs, and often I amble past Chacha’s shop but it remains shut. There are weeds growing around it, where people used to sit at tea and discuss politics, and cricket and Dada Rao while Chacha or his wife served them toasted paos and omelettes. It is funny how quickly weeds grow and occupy a place.The chawl has returned to its routine. My friends have got their voter identity cards now, and voted Dada Rao into power again. I have notseen the crying girl in months. It turned out that the family has shifted to a nearby town, citing dishonour. I began assisting my father at his shop, and now look forward to replacing him, especially after his bout of epilepsy.Since that day, I have had a troubled relationship with sleep. I lie down and my eyes do not shut all night. Even when they do, I hear screams. Ceaseless pouring out of lungs and voice for as long as one may be struck dumb, but they continue.Today, I was lying awake in my bed when the doorbell rang. I got up, slipped my feet into my shoes and walked to the door. I opened it to find an emaciated figure, oddly recognisable, bearded white with watery bronze eyes and a hollow mouth. I looked at him for what I perceived lasted an hour, while the chime of the doorbell and the devotional songs that rang with it reverberated in my head. My reverie was broken again.“Eggs, beta?” asked the man. I looked at him. He was robotic, almost inhuman except that his nostrils flared to allow breathing; nevertheless, when they failed, he opened his mouth and looked on. The only emotive response I could gather was one of a patient impatience, an ache to go somewhere, do something but a retirement to the actuality of everything.“No, uh,” I caught the hair at the back of my head with my right hand and squeezed them, “we have them.” I felt a pang of complex emotions, too tough for me to articulate and I realised that he had perceived that.He turned around, without as much as a twitch in his eyelid, and walked away. I walked into the corridor to chase after him, to talk to him, maybe shed sympathy but he walked on with his white sack, blending into the darkness of the corridor where the rising sun still did not shine.If I could, I would ask Dada Rao if it was worth it. Since the day he walked off into the corridor, I have stopped hearing screams. Even when I am able to catch a few hours’ sleep, I am haunted by a singular dream — the bicycle that lay by the blackened heap of sizzling humanity, the rainbow smeared with ash.utk.sharma01@gmail.com"

Jayadev decries branding of those questioning Centre as anti-nationals ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Taking objection to the branding of those questioning the Centre’s alleged failure in preventing the terrorist attack at Pulwama as anti-nationals, Guntur MP Galla Jayadev said a top US intelligence official hinted in January that there was a high scope for border conflicts and communal riots in the run-up to general elections in India.‘Serious lapse’Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Jayadev said it was because of glaring intelligence failure and procedural lapses that the incident took place, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was out of bounds for at least three-and-a-half hours after the CRPF personnel were ambushed at 3.10 p.m. If information was not available to him for so long, it was also a serious lapse.“Mr. Modi has to explain all these things,” the MP demanded.On top of the failure of the intelligence establishment, Mr. Jayadev said, the road was not cleansed before it was opened for the CRPF convoy and private traffic was allowed at that time.‘Modi’s demand in 2013’When he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi had demanded the resignation of the then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, holding him responsible for a major terrorist strike in 2013, Mr. Jayadev recalled. Mr. Modi should tell what he was supposed to do after the Pulwama incident happened, Mr. Jayadev said, and asserted that patriotism was not his (Mr. Modi’s) sole right or that of the BJP."

The tree branch he’s hanging on turns out to be a snake and he knows he’s going to die. But what if there’s a honeycomb, with drops of honey about to fall tantalisingly?As absurd as the imagery presented by the narration is, Sethupathi’s voice draws you in and makes you believe in the allegorical story.But what is the story anyway? The trailer tells you next to nothing, except that Sethupathi carries off a saree like he’s worn one all his life.The two-minute trailer is cut and edited in such a way that all you get are flashes and impressions of people. Sethupathi’s broad shoulders during the opening and the man who looks his character up and down; Samantha Akkineni with a knife; Fahadh Faasil hitting his head in utter despair; three young boys getting up to mischief; Ramya Krishnan sensuously flipping her hair and more.The trailer is also a riot of colours — blue window frames, yellow walls and sunlight pouring in through many of the shots.If this is just the trailer, then we can’t wait for the actual film!Super Deluxeis scheduled for release on March 29.

Government will teach terrorists a lesson: Amit Shah
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-will-teach-terrorists-a-lesson-amit-shah/article26358378.ece,,https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday said the martyrdom of the 40 CRPF personnel in the Pulwama terrorist attack would not go in vain, and the government would teach the terrorists a lesson.“The BJP stands firmly with families of the soldiers killed in the Pulwama terror attack. I can assure that the martyrdom will not go in vain. The BJP government will teach these terrorists such a lesson that their ability to do something will be finished for a long time,” said Mr. Shah, addressing a Karyakarta Sammelan in Amritsar.He hit out at the ruling Congress government in Punjab,accusing it of betraying the farming community on the issue of farm loan waiver and other promises made during the 2017 Assembly poll. “Since Capt. Amarinder Singh led Congress has come to power they have stopped several public welfare schemes that were started by the presivous BJP-SAD government. The current Congress government only believes in stopping the development work,” he alleged.“I would like to ask Capt. Amarinder where's the complete loan waiver you promised? What about the promise you made to make Punjab drugs-free in one-month after coming to power? Where's the employment and what about the unemployment allowance of Rs. 2500? Neither people are getting employment nor anyone had got the smart phone as promised during the Assembly poll campaing,” alleged Mr. Shah.Mr. Shah alleged that AICC president Rahul Gandhi had promised complete farm loan waiver in Punjab during the Assembly polls, but after assuming power in Punjab, the Congress was now deceiving farming community in the name of waiving the farm loans, said Mr. Shah.Evoking the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Mr. Shah said that “The NDA government established a SIT to investigate 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases and result is that today Sajjan Kumar is behind bars in an anti-Sikh riots case ,” he said.Mr. Shah also took a dig at Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and said “By hugging Pakistan's Army Chief, who has bee killing our soldiers everyday you (Sidhu) have lowered the dignity of the country.”"

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The 12th edition of handicraft and handloom fair, Sampoorn Santhe — ‘Back to Nature’, at the Kalakshetra Foundation, is a melange of man and material.The fair brings craftspeople directly to the consumer. “We have 30-40 artisans back in Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh, and this fair helps us take back maximum profits for our brass and bronze artefacts,” says Deepak Jain, who runs a stall resplendent with antiques and modern metal decor.At the grounds, ceramics comfortably mingle with Channapatna toys; saris and jewellery jostle for customers’ attention. Meanwhile, lampshades fashioned out of mirrors and leather, add a luminous touch to the proceedings.Mohammed Maqbool from Srinagar has mulberry and jute silk saris, woven exclusively by female artisans, while Ashraf Satar from Ajarakhpur, Gujarat brings naturally-dyed block print fabrics in royal navy and vermilion.“Everything at oursanthe(market, in Kannada) is sourced from Nature: whether it’s vegetable-dyed fabric, riverweed baskets, pressed flower jewellery or pottery, Nature is our inspiration,” says Kailash Sudarshan, a member of Sampoorn for 19 years.Five women entrepreneurs dreamed up Sampoorn in 1999 and by 2006, the Bengaluru-based non-profit welcomed 900 artisans, 1,200 craftsmen and designers as members. Today, Sampoorn Santhe is held annually in Chennai, Coimbatore, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Mumbai with a standard footfall of about 10,000 customers.Mohammad Talib has the brightest stall at the venue with ceramics of every hue. “We have around 500 artisans in Uttar Pradesh, who create these planters, pots and pans. Each manufacturing stage has rigorous checks and all our materials are locally sourced and natural,” he explains.Alankaara, a Chennai-based jewellery venture, brings its unique brand of botanical accessories — rings, earrings and pendants. They use pressed flowers and leaves both local as well as ones from the foothills of the Himalayas and Munnar, encased in resin from Allepey pine trees.Jodhpur sheesham furniture, with lustrous marble and tile-top console and center tables, accent pieces and decor items lure customers from around the world. Ruth V, visiting from the US, samples the host of textiles: kantha-work bedspreads, Jaipuri linens, indigo scarves and Assamese silk saris. “This fabric is simply stunning and there’s such a variety to choose from here,” she exclaims.Sampoorn Santhe is on at Kalakeshtra Foundation, Thiruvanmiyur, till February 24, from 11 am to 8 pm.An Indian toy storyChannapatna in southern Karnataka is famously known as the Town of Toys, as it is home to the art of lacquerware: wooden dolls and toys, bangles, and rocking horses."

A police man was also injured in the exchange of fire.Arshad (30), who was injured during the encounter, was declared brought dead by the doctors at the hospital in Mandi Khera.The police said eight cases were registered against him in Palwal and Nuh districts of Haryana and in Rajasthan on charges of attempt to murder, robbery, dacoity, causing hurt and rioting. A resident of Basru village, Arshad was acquitted in two criminal cases registered at Palwal, but his arrest was pending in five other cases.His accomplices have been identified as Ikram (38), and Azad (45), from Nuh and Yameen (36), from Dhoj village in Faridabad, the police said.Superintendent of Police, Nuh, Sangeeta Kalia, said that a seven-member Nuh police team along with the reinforcement from Rewari conducted a raid on the outskirts of Bisru around 9 a.m. following a tip-off that Ikram, wanted in an attempt to murder case of Bichhor police station, was hiding in the village with his gang.Bullet hits constable“On seeing the police team, the accused opened fire. One of the bullets hit constable Pawan on the right hand and another on the chest. But he was protected by the bullet-proof jacket. The police retaliated and a bullet hit Arshad,” said Ms. Kalia.The senior police officer claimed that the police fired four rounds while the criminals fired three shots during the exchange of fire. One of the bullets fired by the criminals hit the police vehicle.Three pistols, three country-made pistols and 69 cartridges have been recovered from the possession of the criminals, the police said.Ikram carries a cash reward of Rs. 50,000 on his head and declaration of another reward of thesame amount is under process, they said. Ikram is involved in nine cases registered in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, West Bengal and Rajasthan. He was not arrested in any of the cases yet.Ms. Kalia said information regarding their criminal activities is being collected and there could be more cases against them."

24 persons held for violence

Five others were absconding.The rioting broke out on Wednesday here at a temple festival, when the police made a bid to disperse a 1000 strong crowd, after a mob unleashed bulls for Erudhattam.The district administration had denied permission for the conduct of Erudhattam during the Venkatesan Swamy temple car festival. The village temple committee had made an undertaking that no Erudhattam would be organised at the venue. Based on this, the crowd was permitted to assemble. However, a mob unleashed bulls in violation, forcing the skeletal police force at the venue to intervene. The mob hurled stones at the police injuring many. Police jeeps and a fire service vehicle was destroyed. Following this, police companies were deployed at the venue. Curiously, the police FIR does not record the destruction of police jeeps. The FIR has named the accused for destruction of fire service vehicle and attacking fire and rescue personnel."

Islamabad’s counsel in Jadhav case seeks dismissal of India’s claim for relief
",,"Pakistan’s counsel Khawar Qureshi and Attorney-General Anwar Mansoor Khan concluded the Kulbhushan Jadhav hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Thursday, by calling for India’s claim for relief to be dismissed or declared inadmissible, on the basis of the appeal options being available to him in Pakistan. The two cited an FIR that had been filed at a civilian court in Pakistan.“India seeks relief which they cannot receive from the court,” insisted Mr. Khan.The legal team also launched a wider attack on India, invoking the Kathua rape case, the Samjhauta Express bombing, the Gujarat riots and the use of pellet guns in Kashmir as instances of failures of India’s judicial system and human rights record. Mr. Qureshi began with a personal attack on India and a number of its senior figures, including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and India’s counsel Harish Salve, accusing New Delhi of inhabiting a “wonderland” in “desperation and total disregard for the truth”.Revision system“Pakistan has a very robust revision and reconsideration system,” Mr. Khan told the court. In Pakistan — as is the case in other countries — military court proceedings are sometimes subject to state security considerations and therefore secrecy is maintained, he said.“We want cooperation with India, we want peaceful coexistence with India but that will not [happen] until India stops sending serving officers across the border for espionage and sabotage,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said following the hearing.“India’s position is that of wonderland. Indeed it is of a rotund character with a fragile cranium. Pakistan is not the one who brought him into this court,” Mr. Qureshi said, in an apparent reference to Mr. Salve, who had on Wednesday slammed the language and tone of Mr. Qureshi’s opening arguments.Judgments by the ICJ are made on an average within six months of the hearings concluding, though this can vary from a shorter period to a couple of years.Decision is bindingThe decision of the court is binding, and non-appealable, though it is possible to make a request for interpretation if there is a dispute between the two sides as to what the judgment means or what its scope is.There is also a possibility to request a review of the judgment if a “matter comes to light” that the court was previously unaware of and which could be a “decisive factor”.While requests for interpretation have on occasion been accepted, no requests for review have been successful to date."

Celebrating the next wave of cultural entrepreneurs who are making a case for local voices and ensuring new talent isn’t overlooked
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Art and culture have always had champions, but the last decade or so has seen a spurt in ideas, in initiatives, in cultural entrepreneurs. It is not a case of a new order replacing the old, but more a reaction to the times, feels artist and cultural theorist Ranjit Hoskote. “There is no singular, monolithic public anymore. Instead, we have a variety of micro publics,” he says, explaining that the new wave of ‘warriors’ who are reviving old traditions and working with local talent, is a response to this. “There is also a sense that there are no institutions that will support this kind of work. So people are going out and creating their own, which is a good thing,” he adds. Examples include artist Jagannath Panda, who revitalised Bhubaneswar’s old city with an art trail last year; Anurupa Roy of Katkatha, who works with puppetry; or Junoon Theatre Company’s Bombay Local series, that organises talks featuring theatre personalities, which are free to the public.Even as established platforms, like the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, have started exploring alternative spaces to showcase world-renowned artists, initiatives like five-year-old St+art are taking art projects right to where the people are. The difference: they also have sign artists, Gond painters and local artists painting walls alongside international names. The art scene today is made up of such small, interlocking, occasionally converging groups that create a diverse ecology. We look at a few who are making an impact, preserving our heritage, ensuring local voices are heard.Michaela and Karan TalwarHarkat, MumbaiGerman filmmaker Michaela — you would’ve spotted her in a cameo inGully Boy— and her husband Karan consider themselves artists “who don’t fit in institutions or in bars”. And their boutique arts studio, Harkat, is for others like them. “Most of pop culture is sparked off by artists working outside the establishment. So we felt we needed to create such a place,” says Michaela, 30. “We are to alternative spaces what Vice is to news.”Since they opened in 2014, Harkat — housed in Bungalow #75 under a canopy of mango and walnut trees — has turned its locality in Versova into a “theatre gully”. “When we started out, there were no alternative spaces. Now five have opened, following their own variations of our model,” says Karan, 31. Audiences are increasing, so are opportunities and venues for artists. “Theatremakers and performers have started thinking in terms of alternative spaces when designing their shows,” says Michaela, recalling how filmmaker Suresh Eriyat said Harkat’s audience for his film,Tokri, was the most receptive he’d encountered in India.Given the current lack of inclusivity in most media, it is heartening to note that almost everything they curate or programme passes through a ‘politics filter’. Proposals problematic about gender and the like are rejected, and in-house curations actively contribute to the conversations. Up next, expect their second in-house play,Jenny and Karl Marx. Details: harkat.inKavery PoovannaWandering Artist, ChennaiA lack of places that promote creativity led Poovanna, 40, to launch Wandering Artist two years ago. The intimate space in RA Puram, which has hosted artistes such as art director Thotta Tharani,sitaristPandit Deobrat Mishra, and pianist Anil Srinivasan, is the go-to place for workshops and performances today. “We also provide a stage for up-and-coming artists, free of cost, to render intimate performances, gather experiences, and hit mainstream media,”says the visual and performing artist, adding that they regularly host training programmes on theatre, art and dance to mentor new talent.But the journey has not been easy. Sustaining the arts is a challenge and looking for patrons is no mean feat. “Arts appreciation is important to encourage and preserve traditional art forms. At some level, we also feel that the notion that arts must be offered free of cost needs fine-tuning as every artist needs their bread and butter,” says Poovanna, who launched Bhuhu, an immersive traditional Indian fine arts course, at the cultural space this month, with modules in murals, sculpture, puppetry and more. Details: wanderingartist.inNabil and MohsinaThe Village Studio, GoaThe alternative art space, which opened its doors in 2017, recently changed hands — with founder Laila Vaziralli handing the reins to Nabil and Mohsina, erstwhile professionals from Bengaluru. While a shift in Goa’s music scene, from EDM and raves to live music and artistic communities, is what convinced the couple to make the move, they assure that Vaziralli (who is behind projects such as Kitsch Mandi and Junta) still curates the events at the studio. This includes performances by poets and indie artists, painting exhibitions, and projects involving the local community that take forward the photographer-turned-artist’s vision of a space that is not only for artists to showcase their work but also “where skills can be taught and learnt”.Their annual music fest and workshops on themes like Sufism were the highlights in December. “Hosting artists such as Papon, Benny Dayal and bands like Thakara has been fun and social media has played a huge role in connecting with them,” says Nabil, adding that costs are always a concern. “[Much of it goes] from our pockets. We don’t have sponsors or funders; we bring in a new gig every week to keep the studio engaging.”Akshat NauriyalSt+art, New DelhiThe walls of Lodhi Colony are awash with colour. Large murals with themes like women’s empowerment and climate change, are attracting residents and tourists alike. The first edition of the Lodhi Art Festival (on till March 15) features 30 new artists, from Sameer Kulavoor and Hanif Kureshi to international names like Daan Botlek (Netherlands) and Brandon Tay (Singapore).This is the latest initiative by non-profit St+art to embed art in streets. “When we began in 2014, art was, to a certain extent, the commodity of the elite. The only exposure people had was if they went to a museum or gallery. So we wanted to take it out of the ‘white cube’ and embed it in public spaces,” says Nauriyal, a drummer and new-media artist who’s always had “an affinity to the alternative underbelly of the city”. In the last five years, they’ve organised 15 festivals in seven cities (including Coimbatore, Chandigarh and Goa), partnered with over 250 artists, painted over 275 walls across the country and started three art districts — in Lodhi, Maqhta (Hyderabad) and Mahim (Mumbai).The larger idea is also to create an ecosystem for local artists. “There is enough talent out there, it just needs a push and a framework,” says the 34-year-old. Rooted in social activism and urban design, their work “draws from the space, the project and the artists’ curation”. There is also an emphasis on working with Indian artisans and art traditions. “We’ve worked with sign painters, Gond and Madhubani artists... putting their amazing art forms on the same contemporary platform as the rest. This leads to an exchange of ideas, cultures and techniques,” he says. If you can’t make it to Lodhi, check out the festival in Maqhta in March-April. Details: st-artindia.orgPooja SaxenaMatra Type Walks, New DelhiThe typeface and graphic designer has been documenting street lettering on her Instagram and Twitter for several years. Her latest project is indiastreetlettering.com, a map-based photographic archive of street lettering from across the country. “Letters in public environments have always interested me. They make an essential part of our visual culture,” says Saxena, 31.Although she feels that the walks she organises are not “needed”, they are interesting because they allow participants to see a place with a new perspective. “I liken them to a design appreciation course, condensed into a couple of hours and conducted in the wild,” she says, adding that similar walks are conducted by Tanya George in Mumbai and Zenab Bastawala in Bengaluru.Being a one-woman operation limits the scope of expanding her work to different neighbourhoods and conducting them more often. But each of the walks she organised in 2018 — from the Paharganj Airbnb Experience to Nicholson Cemetery Type Walk — has been sold out. “I feel confident that non-designers enjoy seeing and discussing design, and sometimes it is us, designers, that couch it in so much jargon that it becomes unapproachable.” Deatils: matratype.comAbhishek MajumdarPlaywright and theatre director, BengaluruIn the 10 years since he co-founded theatre company, Indian Ensemble, with Sandeep Shikhar, Majumdar has seen his plays staged across the world. Dealing with topics such as conflict (The Afterlife of Birds) and communalism (The Djinns of Eidgah), his work has gained acclaim for presenting the nuances of Indian life to a global audience.Aishwarya TipnisATA, DelhiIn Delhi, she restored a haveli in Kashmere Gate; in Madhya Pradesh, it was the Mahidpur Fort; and in West Bengal, she is preserving Chandannagar’s French heritage. Currently working on the over 130-year-old Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (with UNESCO), the 38-year-old conservation architect was conferred the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres last year.But the company is, at its core, an ensemble, with an emphasis on making theatre training more accessible, encouraging linguistic diversity, and helping promote the livelihoods of theatre practitioners. “We failed and succeeded at plays, but I don’t think our values wavered,” says the 38-year-old, whose upcoming works includeBaatin, a play about theQuranbeing developed at the National Theatre in London.Currently he is focussed on setting up a new company, Bhasha Centre of Performing Arts and Research, which will focus on making multilingual theatre, with a special focus on works inspired by gender studies and Dalit studies. The organisation will also focus on diversity and insurance for theatre artistes.Uday Kapur and Mo JoshiAzadi Records, New DelhiGiven today’s socio-economic climate, Kapur, 26, feels that an independent record label promoting local artistes is the need of the hour. “We wanted to create an organisation that helps bring music (the forward-thinking, politically conscious kind) from marginalised sections, and introduce new stories to the music industry. Such as Prabh Deep’s, and the affects of the anti-Sikh riots on his community,” says Kapur, who was inspired to start Azadi Records after writing his thesis on Indian protest musicians such as Indian Ocean and Imphal Talkies and The Howlers.Rohan Narayana MurtyMurty Classical Library of India, GugaonA passion for literature may be surprising in a computer scientist, but we’re glad he loves words. Murty, 36 (son of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy), is supporting the documentation of pre-modern literary works — in languages such as Sanskrit, Bangla, Kannada, Tamil and more. The ongoing series of facing-page translations is published by Harvard University Press.Established in 2017, their current roster includes names like Sez On The Beat, Seedhe Maut, Tienas, and Swadesi, among others. He says the impact of their releases (all well received) has stretched beyond the music industry. “People within Tilak Nagar have started conversing about substance abuse after Prabh’s album dropped. We hope the Aarey [deforestation] movement will get a push with Swadesi’s track. Overall, we hope to paint an accurate, nuanced picture of what’s going on in the country,” he shares.While money is always a challenge — “we’ve only put our own money in so far,” says co-founder Joshi — digital is key to getting their music out. “We’re still small footprint-wise, but we get relatively good engagement and are growing at a good pace. We’ve collaborated with different platforms (Saavn, SoundCloud) and plan to do more this year,” concludes Joshi. Details: azadirecords.comSonia AcharyaWomen of Rhythm, MumbaiAs percussion is highly male dominated, Acharya, 29, wanted to motivate more women to enter the mainstream. The first edition of Women of Rhythm was held in Mumbai in 2016, and was dedicated to the first ladies of instruments like theghatam,mridangam,pakhawajandtabla. “At the time, I looked at it as a one-off concert, but we ended up building it. The initiative is geared towards breaking gender disparity, giving visibility, creating awareness and, most importantly, showcasing talent,” she says. “We’ve worked with some phenomenal artistes likevidushisSukanya Ramgopal and Dandamudi Sumathi Ramamohan Rao, and younger artistes like Charu Hariharan, Neesha Mokal and Mitali Vinchurkar,” she adds.For Acharya, one of the successes is that “almost all the percussionists featured in WOR have started to get regular, well-paid, quality work. I’m looking forward to the edition where we can get international artistes and have them collaborate with Indian artistes”. Currently, WOR is undergoing structural changes to create more video content. This year, they are also planning to take the property to different cities, with collaborative, theme-based concerts.Hinesh JethwaniIndian Hippy, MumbaiWhen Jethwani’s career hit a bump in 2008 — his IT business tanked during recession — a collection of newspaper clippings and a fascination for the dying art of hand-painted movie posters gave him new purpose. “It didn’t start off as a business plan; I had a lot of time on my hands and I wanted to do an experiment, to see what the artists were capable of and how people would react to it,” recalls the 38-year-old. An unusual plan for someone who did not enjoy Bollywood films growing up!Tracking them down was the difficult part (“I walked around Dadar, Matunga and the Shivaji Park area, which had had a lot of art studios”). The ensuing conversations found form in Indian Hippy, a collective of 12 poster and banner artists. In the last decade, they’ve succeeded in popularising the art form, creating everything from customised posters to 25-foot canvases for hotels like Stillwell Hotel in Los Angeles. “Restaurants mostly want hand-pained art, like wall canvases, or memorabilia (his website, bollywoodmovieposters.com, is dedicated to the latter),” says Jethwani, adding, “We also use digital to our advantage, like at a recent wedding where the client ordered nine posters of the bride and groom (in movies likeDilwale Dulhania Le JayengeandTanu Weds Manu) and blew them up into 10x12 foot banners.”However, he is aware there is an expiry date to his venture. Of the original collective, only five artists remain and “age has caught up with most of them”. The attempt now is to ensure continuity. “We want to get the younger generation fascinated about this beautiful hand-painted art,” he concludes. Details: hippy.inRashmi DhanwaniThe Art X Company, Mumbai“How do you articulate a sense of value for something as intangible as culture?” The question led Dhanwani, 34, to the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA), Mumbai, where she was instrumental in launching its first outreach department, creating direct engagement with the audience. This also helped her set the stage for starting Art X in 2015. “I wanted to create an organisation that was genre-agnostic when discussing access to the cultural sector. One that could create tangible points of engagement,” she explains.From understanding the demands of the audience to what sectors of the community haven’t been included in performance culture, the last three years have seen her curating ventures across the country where, she says, the amount of talent is “immense”.This year, she’s also looking ahead, organising culture meets in eight of India’s metros and gearing up for a host of interesting projects. “We’re working with the Serendipity Arts Festival in Goa and seeing another client that’s interested in research and curation,” she says. Details: art-x.coBabitha GeorgeUnbox Festival, Delhi-BangaloreYes, the festival explores the intersection of art, technology and design, but it has fun doing it — with talks on the anatomy of an AI to experiments in a food lab, and even a session on conspiracy theories. “We noticed that people tend to keep going to the same spaces and communities. So we wanted to create a space where a person could address a question with someone they’d never have been able to work with,” explains George, one of the co-founders.Begun by interdisciplinary consultancy, Quicksand Design Studio, in 2011, the fifth edition (it took a break after 2014) recently concluded in Bengaluru. One of the many highlights was a workshop by professor Justin Marshall, of the University of Northumbria, which expanded on his work with block printers from Jaipur, looking at how conductive ink can be used to think of new manifests for block printing. “This year we had around 100-odd pieces of programming, which sparked a lot of discussions,” shares the 38-year-old, adding that, going forward, the festival will continue to help create a vibrant network between Indian and international artists, thinkers and performers. Details: unboxfestival.comHimanshu VermaRed Earth, JaipurHe moved to Jaipur a year ago, to escape the bustle of Delhi, but that’s the only shift Verma, 38, is making. He continues to be India’s ‘sari man’ — exploring contemporary masculinity and its fluidity through the “open-ended garment” — even as his travelling show, The Saree Festival (started in 2014), explores the drape’s various styles and design-led interventions.For over a decade now, his multi-arts initiative, Red Earth, has also been creating conversations on Indian aesthetics. “A lot of my work is centered around seasons and festivals, to keep the connection with Indian aesthetics alive,” he says. The last edition of the Monsoon Festival had digital miniatures by graphic designers, alongside traditional oil canvases and contemporary works from artists like Anjana Mehra. His latest is the Cabinet of Curiosities, which he débuted in Jaipur last month and plans to bring to Mumbai and Chennai soon. “We created our version of the cabinet, with a mix of design, crafts from Jaipur, and works of contemporary artists like Olivia Fraser, Jyoti Bhatt and Akanksha Agarwal. The curation challenged how things [are perceived and] should be.” Details: redearthindia.comHarpreet KaurArts Manager, LondonKaur is a product of happy accidents — from her parents’ immigration to the UK to a childhood viewing of the works of the British-Asian Theatre Company, Tamasha, which fostered a huge interest in theatre, arts and diaspora rights. “It’s all about how creative projects are looking at social change. That’s my focus,” she says.Years of freelancing, often working alongside the Arts Council England, have made her one of Britain’s cultural experts, according to the BBC. And yet, the need of the hour, she says, is inclusivity, in all its forms. “There’s a need for everyone’s voices to be heard, and the arts council has allowed us to constantly examine diversity in gender, race issues, disability, and a range of socially-relevant issues,” explains, Kaur, who works primarily with the diaspora, like a recent programme that allowed Hindustani artists to tell their stories to the British upper-class.Her most recent arena of focus? Climate change. Delving into international research and development, she says the cultural lens can have a much greater impact than anyone possibly imagines. “This work — what I get the opportunity to do — it’s priceless, and someone has to do it. I’m just grateful that that person is me.”Quasar Thakore PadamseeQ Theatre Productions(QTP), MumbaiDecember in Mumbai, for theatre lovers at least, evoke memories of Thespo, the “under 25” festival that turned 20 last year. While he is quick to emphasise that the initiative is “way bigger than those who started it” — Quasar co-founded QTP at 20, with his friends — he still remains a prominent “oracle” figure, who dispenses advice. His initiative is credited with giving theatre practitioners a way to make their interests more than just a hobby.“When we started, the emphasis was on showcase. Then it became training, and now it’s about exposure, and we have a lot of collaborations with international performers,” says Quasar, 40, the son of late advertising veteran Alyque Padamsee. Internationally-acclaimed puppeteers, mime performers, and solo artists conduct workshops here, and their plays highlight India’s theatrical diversity. A few months before the festival starts, a jury tours the country auditioning performances. You can look forward to his upcoming play,Every Brilliant Thing, in March.Sofar SoundsWhat started as a small gathering of six in an apartment in London 10 years ago is today a community of over a thousand musicians, artistes and hosts. The name behind ‘intimate and unique gigs’ across the globe, Sofar Sounds (founded by music entrepreneur Rafe Offer, with friends Rocky Start and Dave Alexander), has had a presence in India since 2011, says Sarah Lipman, Head of Communications. A community that is all about hosting new artists and fresh music, she shares how many artists tell them how hard it is to establish a career. “We offer them an opportunity to share their music with a full, attentive audience eager to hear something new,” says Lipman, adding how hosting shows in untraditional spaces — like boutiques, cafés, people’s homes — is their USP. “Finding venues is always a challenge. We are always on the hunt for new ones!” While they have worked with all kinds of emerging artists, from spoken word to hip-hop, musicians such as Leon Bridges, Lianne LaHavas and Ed Sheeran have also been a part of their gigs. ““We have hosted names like Parvaaz, Tajdar Junaid and Prateek Kuhad at Sofars in India,” she says."

Actor-director Aparna Sen talks about the importance of creative freedom, the subtext in her narratives and how the actor and director in her shape each other
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Like her films, Aparna Sen has a lot to say. Like her films, it is seldom on the surface; it is only when you process it that you get the essence. The celebrated actor-director was in Delhi recently to participate in an international symposium on ‘Creativity and Freedom’. As a film writer, one is always keen to know what was playing on the director’s mind when she shaped certain characters. For Aparna, one has a long list. From trivial details like why she named the photographer inParomaas Rahul Rai to the question if she was drawing from personal experience when she was writing the Rakhee-starrer, as Aparna was herself photographed by a celebrated photographer forLife.Aparna says, “no”, with a smile. She reveals that she met Raghu Rai much later though she was aware of his work. She admits that some things that exist in the subconscious mind do slip into the narrative. Perhaps, it addresses more complex questions like the bond between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law in herParomitar Ek Din(House of Memories) or giving a woman agency in a communal riot-like situation inMr. & Mrs. Iyer.Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the theme: ‘Creativity and Freedom’?I believe this is the raging topic of the day because your creative freedom is being suppressed in so many areas. You can’t write, paint, make films without worrying about some faction or other whose ‘sentiments’ will be hurt! If you critique the state of affairs in your country in any way, you are branded an anti-national.Many different groups of people have become more sensitive than they used to be. They are well within their rights to object to something a filmmaker may have said, but they indulge in rioting or vandalising cinemas or forcibly stopping entry into theatres. The state governments, which should be dealing with such law and order problems, put a stay on the release of the film.Did you ever face censorship?DuringMr. and Mrs. Iyer, some dialogues were cut out in Mumbai and Pune, if I remember correctly. The consensus was that what had been said about Muslims in the film would enrage them and create law and order problems. But you have to take into account the intent of the film. One person or a character saying something derogatory about a Muslim doesn’t mean that the filmmaker herself is against the community. Unfortunately, a scene or a piece of dialogue in a film is taken out of context and judged.Your films had female characters at the centre of the narrative much before it became a trend. What were your concerns?Look, I make films about individuals. But I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act. But I don’t make a film as a platform for my politics. When I make a film about a woman, it is possible that my feminist politics surfaces somewhere but it is not with the intention of propagating feminism.I certainly am a feminist but, in my cinema, I don’t talk about any ‘isms’. I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How has it evolved over the years?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films. But most of them and many feminist filmmakers, in particular, were talking about women negotiating space for themselves in a male-dominated society. Women were mostly shown as persons trying to fulfil their own potential. A notable exception isMahanagarby Satyajit Ray. Here you find a very early feminist narrative where the man and the woman are treated as equal. At the end of the film, when both are without jobs, both stand looking out at the city stretched out before them, and the husband says, ‘In such a great metropolis, surely at least one of us will find a job?’ It is one of the best feminist films I have ever seen.After that, it was more about women trying to realising their own potential and their fight to do so. Any talk about female desire or sexual choice was strictly taboo. That’s why in 1985, my second filmParomacreated such a furore! Many people wanted it taken out of theatres. They felt that women’s freedom didn’t mean licence for adultery! My point is, licence according to whom? The male-dominated patriarchal system where the moment a woman exercises her sexual choice, it is called a ‘licence?’Today, the situation is completely different. Women filmmakers are now very comfortable in their shoes. They are comfortable making films about male characters, who are persecuted by other males or even females. Alankrita Shrivastava addressed the issue of female desire inLipstick Under My Burkha. Konkona Sen Sharma made a film (Death in the Gunj) about a young man where the macho world around him bullies him so much that he commits suicide.,How much do you invest in your characters?Hugely. In the process of fleshing them out in the script, they take on a life of their own. I had planned on having Violet Stoneham of36 Chowringhee Laneto go away to Australia in the end. That was then the reality of India in 1981. Anglo-Indians migrated all the time to England, or Australia, New Zealand or Canada. But I just couldn’t make her go! InYugant, which many outside of Bengal haven’t seen, the dissolution of a marriage was used as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the earth. The couple there were called Deepak and Anusuya. When I was making the film, the shooting went on for a long time as we had no money. In between, I was in New Jersey with my husband and suddenly one night, I started crying. When he asked why, I said, I was missing them so much. He asked, “Who?” “Deepak and Anusuya,” I said, “I haven't seen them for so long!” I get emotionally involved with my characters.Do the actor and director reside in two different compartments in your body?They merge. The actor comes to the fore when I am writing. I write dialogue, which very few actors have difficulty in speaking. Because when I am writing, the actor in me is silently acting it all out in her mind. And when I am directing actors, the actor in me is very helpful. If an actor asks me “Why am I saying this?” I can usually tell the actor how he or she can motivate himself/ herself.Is there ever a clash?Only when I am acting and directing at the same time.

She is another person.Is her style more technical?No, I don’t think it is technical. It is removed from the classical format. In the classical format, there is a beginning, a middle and an end. She opens with two people looking into the boot of a car, which is interesting because it is dramatic and intriguing with no formal 'introduction' to the characters as such.Why don't you make films in Hindi?I would love to make a film in Hindi.

Spectators turned violent when police tried to stop the event ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Eight policemen and few fire and rescue personnel were injured in rioting during an erudhattam organised illegally here on Wednesday at Madakondapalli in Denkankottai. Two vehicles belonging to the police and one of the fire services were damaged.An irate spectator-mob hurled stones at the skeletal police force that was deployed to disperse a little over 1000 people who had gathered at the venue.The event was organised without permission from the district administration as part of the Sri Prasanna Venkateswara temple festivities.Though permission was denied for the event, video footage showed a mass assembly of people at the venue, with barricades erected and banners announcing ""Jallikattu"" put up by the organisers. Video recordings of the event showed spectators running helter-skelter, several hurling stones at a few policemen who were running for cover.Collector S. Prabhakar said permission was denied for the erudhattam two days ago, and police were deployed in the village. However, the temple committee had taken permission from the local police, claiming that only the temple festival would be held and not erudhattam.But a few men had brought in a few cattle and let it run. When police tried to stop it, a 500-strong mob turned violent. Police personnel were deployed at Madakondapalli, and a Superintendent of Police and two Deputy Superintendents were at the spot to ensure peace. Over 30 people had been secured, the Collector toldThe Hindu.The incident is the fourth such case of illegal erudhattam organised in the district over the past fortnight. Last week, two bulls and a cow were killed in an erudhattam held without permission here in Rayakottai, leading to a stringent monitoring by the administration."

In a riot of colour, Sampoorn Santhe brings craft groups from 18 Indian states to Kalakshetra ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The 12th edition of handicraft and handloom fair, Sampoorn Santhe — ‘Back to Nature’, at the Kalakshetra Foundation, is a melange of man and material.The fair brings craftspeople directly to the consumer. “We have 30-40 artisans back in Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh, and this fair helps us take back maximum profits for our brass and bronze artefacts,” says Deepak Jain, who runs a stall resplendent with antiques and modern metal decor.At the grounds, ceramics comfortably mingle with Channapatna toys; saris and jewellery jostle for customers’ attention. Meanwhile, lampshades fashioned out of mirrors and leather, add a luminous touch to the proceedings.Mohammed Maqbool from Srinagar has mulberry and jute silk saris, woven exclusively by female artisans, while Ashraf Satar from Ajarakhpur, Gujarat brings naturally-dyed block print fabrics in royal navy and vermilion.“Everything at oursanthe(market, in Kannada) is sourced from Nature: whether it’s vegetable-dyed fabric, riverweed baskets, pressed flower jewellery or pottery, Nature is our inspiration,” says Kailash Sudarshan, a member of Sampoorn for 19 years.Five women entrepreneurs dreamed up Sampoorn in 1999 and by 2006, the Bengaluru-based non-profit welcomed 900 artisans, 1,200 craftsmen and designers as members. Today, Sampoorn Santhe is held annually in Chennai, Coimbatore, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Mumbai with a standard footfall of about 10,000 customers.Trade troublesWhile sales at fairs are brisk, organisers lament the state of the nation’s handicraft community, after the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). “Leather and jewellery items have a 12% tax imposed while 5% GST is levied on handloom products. This has severely dampened spirits especially among rural artisans, many of whom do not even know how to fill a GST form, let alone claim their elusive reimbursement. So this kind of setting at asantheis a welcome avenue for these craftspeople, where there is no middleman and they can recover costs to sustain their craft for at least three months,” explains Kailash.Mohammad Talib has the brightest stall at the venue with ceramics of every hue. “We have around 500 artisans in Uttar Pradesh, who create these planters, pots and pans. Each manufacturing stage has rigorous checks and all our materials are locally sourced and natural,” he explains.Alankaara, a Chennai-based jewellery venture, brings its unique brand of botanical accessories — rings, earrings and pendants. They use pressed flowers and leaves both local as well as ones from the foothills of the Himalayas and Munnar, encased in resin from Allepey pine trees.Jodhpur sheesham furniture, with lustrous marble and tile-top console and center tables, accent pieces and decor items lure customers from around the world. Ruth V, visiting from the US, samples the host of textiles: kantha-work bedspreads, Jaipuri linens, indigo scarves and Assamese silk saris. “This fabric is simply stunning and there’s such a variety to choose from here,” she exclaims.Sampoorn Santhe is on at Kalakeshtra Foundation, Thiruvanmiyur, till February 24, from 11 am to 8 pm."

",,"China is barring foreign travellers from Tibet over a period of several weeks that includes a pair of sensitive political anniversaries questioning the legitimacy of Beijing’s rule over the Himalayan region.Travel agencies contacted on Wednesday said foreign tourists would not be allowed back into Tibet until April 1. It’s not clear when the ban started, although some monitoring groups said it began this month.The ban was confirmed by the online customer service portal of the Tibet Youth International Travel Service, as well as staff at the Tibet Vista and Go to Tibet travel agencies. Both are based in the southwestern city of Chengdu — the main jumping-off point for visits to Tibet. March 10 is the 60th anniversary of an abortive 1959 uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, while anti-government riots occurred on March 14, 2008, in the regional capital Lhasa.Annual occurrenceAlthough the foreigner travel ban is an annual occurrence, the occasion of the 60th anniversary is drawing added attention.Amid heavy security on the ground, Tibet is almost entirely closed to foreign journalists and diplomats and information about actual conditions there is difficult to obtain.

The two cited an FIR that had been filed at a civilian court in Pakistan.“India seeks relief which they cannot receive from the court,” insisted Mr. Khan.Also ReadKulbhushan Jadhav ICJ hearing | Live updates: Jadhav tried under espionage law in military court, says PakistanThe legal team also launched a wider attack on India, invoking the Kathua rape case, the Samjhauta Express bombing, the Gujarat riots and the use of pellet guns in Kashmir as instances of failures of India’s judicial system and human rights record. Mr. Qureshi began with a personal attack on India and a number of its senior figures, including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and India’s counsel Harish Salve, accusing New Delhi of inhabiting a “wonderland” in “desperation and total disregard for the truth”.Revision system“Pakistan has a very robust revision and reconsideration system,” Mr. Khan told the court. In Pakistan — as is the case in other countries — military court proceedings are sometimes subject to state security considerations and therefore secrecy is maintained, he said.“We want cooperation with India, we want peaceful coexistence with India but that will not [happen] until India stops sending serving officers across the border for espionage and sabotage,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said following the hearing.“India’s position is that of wonderland. Indeed it is of a rotund character with a fragile cranium. Pakistan is not the one who brought him into this court,” Mr. Qureshi said, in an apparent reference to Mr. Salve, who had on Wednesday slammed the language and tone of Mr. Qureshi’s opening arguments.Judgments by the ICJ are made on an average within six months of the hearings concluding, though this can vary from a shorter period to a couple of years.Decision is bindingThe decision of the court is binding, and non-appealable, though it is possible to make a request for interpretation if there is a dispute between the two sides as to what the judgment means or what its scope is.There is also a possibility to request a review of the judgment if a “matter comes to light” that the court was previously unaware of and which could be a “decisive factor”.While requests for interpretation have on occasion been accepted, no requests for review have been successful to date."

‘Don’t use riots, terror attacks for politics’
",,"A day after sealing a seat-sharing pact with the BJP, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday asked the NDA government not to behave in a way that would fuel allegations that it was trying to wage a war to influence poll results.Riots and terror attacks should not be used for “political gains”, the Sena said in an editorial in the party mouthpieceSaamana.Targeting students from Kashmir over such incidents could spell more trouble for the government, it warned.The BJP and the Sena announced a seat-sharing arrangement for the upcoming Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly elections after overcoming strained ties and earlier declarations of going solo.Without taking names, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said, “Sometime back there were political allegations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could wage a small-scale war to win elections... The rulers should not behave in a way in whcih these allegations would gather strength.”Referring to the February 14 Pulwama bombing in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, the Marathi daily said, “The country is still boiling over the terror attack, hence some may face criticism. [But] riots and terror attacks should not be used for political gains.”Cautioning the government that the recent attacks on students from Kashmir in other parts of the country could spell more trouble, it recalled the 1984 anti-Sikh riots after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and said the Congress was still “paying a heavy price” for it.It also took a dig at certain lawmakers for their comments on India-Pakistan relations in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack.Noting that Punjab Congress minister Navjot Singh Sidhu was ousted from a television show after he called for dialogue with Pakistan even after the Pulwama attack, the Sena said pressure was mounted on him and a campaign launched against him over the remarks.On the other hand, the comments of BJP legislator Nepal Singh, who recently stirred a controversy with his statement that Army jawans “ought to die”, were selectively ignored and he did not face any action, it pointed out.It said, “Our intelligence officials can trace an e-mail purportedly referring to a threat to the Prime Minister’s life but they fail to stop terror attack on a convoy.”Before 2014, Modi and RSS held the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government responsible for every terror attack in the country.“Then it should be understood if someone expects the current Prime Minister to uproot terrorism from the country,” it said.Our intelligence officials can trace an e-mail purportedly referring to a threat to the PM’s life but fail to stop attack on a convoy.Editorial insaamana"

Mob attacks police station in West Bengal’s Birbhum ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mob-attacks-police-station-in-west-bengals-birbhum/article26297843.ece,"
Incident staged to disturb communal harmony, say police.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"An incident of alleged kidnapping of a female school teacher turned parts of the Labpur block in the Birbhum district into a battlefield on Sunday. The mob attacked the local police station with stones, while the police alleged that the objective of the purported kidnapping was to disturb communal peace in the area. Three persons, including the father of the allegedly kidnapped woman, Suphravat Batyabal, a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, were arrested. Interestingly, the Trinamool Congress’s (TMC) district leadership also indicated that their local TMC MLA is possibly involved in the kidnapping of the 22-year-old school teacher.Tension gripped Labpur on Saturday as a mob smashed the local TMC MLA Manirul Islam’s vehicle and chased him, forcing him to take refuge in the local police station. They alleged that Mr. Islam was involved in the kidnapping of the local school teacher. The mob attacked the police station, where Mr. Islam took shelter, and pelted stones on the forces for a couple of hours.The incident took place four days after Mr. Baytabal’s daughter was allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint at Labpur. The woman's mother lodged a complaint at the Labpur Police Station. She, however, did not mention any names but claimed that “unknown miscreants” kidnapped her daughter, district police officials said. Following the arrest of the woman’s father on Sunday, an Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) of Birbhum told journalists that the entire incident was “staged to implement a political agenda.”“We have arrested the boys (Raju Sardar and Dipankar Mondal), who apparently kidnapped the woman, from Dalkhola in north Bengal. They met the kidnapped woman’s father Supravat Batyabal [who, too, was arrested] earlier in the week and plotted the kidnapping,” said the police officer.Mr. Batyabal, who was a member of Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), switched to the TMC after the CPI-M’s defeat in 2011. Mr. Batyabal joined the BJP recently. Police said that the rescued teacher is in a state of shock.The district leadership of the BJP, which has grown substantially in Birbhum over the last few years, alleged that the miscreants were TMC-backed goons.However, the Birbhum chief of the TMC, Anubrata Mondal, alleged that both the BJP and Manirul Islam, TMC’s MLA, are involved in the kidnapping of the girl. “When the girl was interrogated, she said that her father and Mani uncle [Manirul Islam] masterminded the plan. Even if anyone is attached to the party [the TMC] and encouraging such acts, the person won’t be spared. No one is a Governor here,” said Mr. Mondal.Police officials, however, refused to comment on Mr. Islam’s involvement.(With agency inputs.)"

Mamata questions timing of Pulwama terror attack

Refers to ‘intelligence inputs’, fixing of responsibility
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday raised questions on the timing of the terrorist attack at Pulwama before the Lok Sabha polls, and asked why the incident was not prevented despite “intelligence inputs.”“How have they [Pakistan] got this encouragement before elections? After Parliament is over, when this type of thing happen, as a citizen of the country, I am in doubt. Why have we not taken action against Pakistan earlier? Why at the time of elections, you tell me?” Ms. Banerjee questioned at the State Secretariat.Referring to the suicide attack that killed at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel at Pulwama on February 14, the Chief Minister said that, like all in the Opposition, she wants strong action against terrorists, but emphasised the need to fix responsibility. “Why were 2005 jawans in 78 vehicles were allowed in one convoy when the government had intelligence inputs and information that attacks could happen?” Ms. Banerjee said.“Now we see that we are quiet and [PM] Modi and Amit Shah are making speeches everyday, and through these speeches it appears that only they are patriotic and we are all foreigners,” she said.The Trinamool Congress (TMC) chairperson repeatedly referred to “intelligence inputs” and, browsing through her phone, claimed to have a copy of an intelligence notification of February 8. “My phone is tapped by intelligence agencies. I am telling you officially that I have evidence of it and I will place it before you at the right time,” she said.‘Fomenting trouble’Ms. Banerjee also alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other pro-Hindutva organisations were stoking public outrage following theattack to incite unrest in West Bengal. “I want to appeal to the right-minded people of West Bengal that the citizens of this country have the right to stay anywhere,” she said.The CM alleged that the BJP, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) are taking out late night processions with national flags and targeting people of different communities. “It is a planted game of the RSS, VHP and the BJP. We will resist attempts to take political advantage of the situation,” she said, directing the police to take action against those indulging in riots.BJP hits backsWest Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh hit back at Ms. Banerjee, saying that while the entire country is demanding “tough action against the enemy”, the TMC is opposing tough action against Pakistan. While Mr. Ghosh said that the Chief Minister is “seeing the ghost of BJP everywhere, particularly when the law and order situation of the State has collapsed,” he also wanted to know what was stopping her government from announcing an ex-gratia compensation for the two slain CRPF jawans from the State."

Tear gas, hate speech marks 14th yellow vest protest in France

President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that “the anti-Semitic injuries he received are the absolute negation of what we are and of what makes us a great nation.”
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Police fired tear gas and brought in water cannons and a horse brigade to disperse several thousand yellow vest protesters Saturday massed near a Paris landmark at the end of a march through the French capital, the 14th straight weekend of demonstrations.Anti-Semitic remarks hurled by a few at a noted philosopher on the protesters’ route were the bitter finale to a day of tension.Acrid clouds of tear gas filled the esplanade of Les Invalides monument, obscuring the gold dome that crowns the monument housing Napoleon’s tomb.Tension also marked demonstrations in other cities.In Rouen, in Normandy, a car blocked by demonstrators pushed through the crowd, slightly injuring four people, the all-news channel BFMTV reported.Police used tear gas and water cannon in Bordeaux, a stronghold of the yellow vest movement, and other cities on the 14th straight Saturday of protests.Riot police officers take position as demonstrators wearing yellow vests protest during a visit by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Biarritz, southwestern France on December 18, 2018.  
| Photo Credit:APAnother demonstration in the capital was planned for Sunday to mark three months since the movement held its first nationwide protests Nov. 17.In Paris, an array of insults, some anti-Semitic, by a handful of yellow vest protesters targeted a well-known French philosopher, Alain Finkielkraut, underscoring excesses that surge within an increasingly divided movement with radical fringes.President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that “the anti-Semitic injuries he received are the absolute negation of what we are and of what makes us a great nation.”The president’s was among a chorus of tweets, with Interior Minister Christophe Castaner denouncing “the surge of pure hate,” while government spokesman Benjamin Griveau tweeted that “the ugly beast lurks in the anonymity of the crowd.”The insults included words like “Zionist!” and “Go back to Tel Aviv!” and “We are France!”Finkielkraut once showed sympathy for the movement but criticized it in a recent interview with Le Figaro daily. Some yellow vest protesters have expressed racist or anti-Semitic views online and on the sidelines of protests.“I felt an absolute hate,” Finkielkraut told the Sunday paper Le Journal du Dimanche. He expressed relief that police intervened.Lines of riot police used tear gas and an impressive backup, a special horse brigade and water cannons — apparently not used — to force the agitated crowd to disperse.The Paris prosecutor’s office said 15 people were detained for questioning, far less than the scores detained in earlier, larger demonstrations that degenerated into scattered rioting and destruction.Violence has marked most of the protests that started against fuel taxes and grew into a mass movement against Macron and his pro-business policies.However, the increasingly divided movement is having trouble maintaining momentum, and support from the public that initially massively backed protesters, polls showed.French media quoted the Interior Ministry as saying that 41,500 protesters nationwide turned out Saturday, some 10,000 less than the previous week, with 5,000 in Paris."

Kashmiri doctor in Kolkata decides to stay

Threatened, asked to leave city ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"For the first few hours of Saturday morning, Dr. Rafique Dar (name changed to protect identity), had made up his mind to leave Kolkata.The Kashmiri cardiologist was threatened and told to leave the city to ensure the safety of his family. But by evening, he changed his mind following a massive outpouring of what he described as “love and care from his fellow city dwellers.” The middle-aged doctor from Srinagar has been residing in Kolkata since 2007.“I have made this my home and I want to live here,” said Dr. Dar, who is married to a Bengali Christian teacher. But following two incidents in quick succession, his confidence in Kolkata started receding.On Saturday morning, a group of men encircled him at his doorstep and told him they would “destroy” his family if he did not leave for Kashmir in 24 hours. The men, unarmed and in their 20s, abused him and Kashmiris, for the Pulwama attack. A similar incident took place on Friday evening.“They repeatedly said that they would harm my family and wife,” Dr. Dar said, sitting in his spacious living room in south Kolkata’s Tiljala area. The doctor from Srinagar’s Government Medical College requested that he should not be identified, or his family or even his neighbourhood.The earlier incident, the first after the Pulwama attack, took place on Friday evening as Dr. Dar stepped out to buy groceries. “A separate set of men encircled me, identified me as a Kashmiri and threatened me,” he said.Following the incidents, Dr. Dar wrote to the Chief Minister, who did not respond, but the chairperson of the State’s Child Rights Commission, Ananya Chakraborty, called to ensure his safety. Earlier, the Home Ministry had issued an advisory to the States to provide safety to Kashmiris. Dr. Dar thanked a Kashmiri journalist for circulating his post where he appealed for “protection”, which went viral.Among the early respondents was a Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) activist Sumaan Sengupto. He spoke to his friend Samim Ahmed, a noted writer, and informed the police.“I think the officer informed the local Tiljala Police Station and they acted promptly,” Sengupto said.Kolkata has about 50 Kashmiri women and men working in mostly in the private sector. The number goes up in the winter as the families of Kashmiri residents visit the city. Besides, an unknown number of dry fruit and garments retailers have visited the city periodically, over decades. The police do not have any record of them. “Because we never had any major problem with the Kashmiris visiting the city,” said a retired Commissioner of Kolkata Police.One of the two Kolkata police personnel posted outside Dr. Dar’s flat said that they are “posted in shifts to provide round-the-clock security.” Dr. Dar said that officials were meeting him periodically, exchanging “a few friendly words to boost confidence” while his phone had not stopped ringing since the post went viral. Following such support, Dr. Dar changed his mind by late evening on Saturday.“There are so many people around, so many are offering us to stay with them, calling or visiting us. I’m feeling happy and secured,” he said. However, he still is worried about his two daughters, who go to a nearby school. “Is it possible to provide security to the kids throughout the year?” he asks.Meanwhile, the public address system perched on the roof of the mobile vans of Kolkata Police are asking people to “maintain calm and peace,” while small rallies are brought out to advocate an attack on Pakistan."

Suburban and long-distance train services were affected for around four hours due to the protest.According to officials of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) there were more than 500 protesters. The crowd started gathering around 8 a.m., and the tracks were cleared by noon.Preeti Bahot, a commuter from Nallasopara, had to wait for hours for a train. “I reached the station by 8 a.m., as I do every day. I had no clue about the protest, which started around the same time,” she said. Ms. Bahot, who works in Churchgate, said protesters initially also pelted stones, before women on board a local train told them to stop. “The crowd kept increasing and there were easily more than a thousand people at the station. As nobody knew about the protest, commuters kept coming,” she said.Lathi chargeSecurity staff had to resort to lathi charge to clear the crowd. “There was no headway for over three hours, despite a dialogue with protesters,” a senior official said.“We are registering cases against the protesters for unlawful assembly and rioting. We will use video footage to identify those behind this,” Purushottam Karad, Deputy Commissioner of Police, GRP (Western), said.Additional Superintendent of Police, Vasai, Vijaykant Sagar said the situation was brought under control around noon. “We appeal to people to protest peacefully over the martyrdom of our jawans and urge protesters not to inconvenience others or create a law and order situation,” he said.With protesters blocking all four tracks, several train services were cancelled. Commuters stranded on trains mid-section were forced to walk on the tracks. Passengers expressed their plight on social media.Western Railway (WR) could operate local services only between Churchgate and Vasai. Trains resumed a little after noon, but the backlog forced WR to cancel several trips. In all, WR had to cancel 54 services through the day, and morning services ran around 20 minutes late. Several long-distance trains, such as Vivek Express which runs between Bandra Terminus and Jammu Tawi, were delayed, while others were short terminated in Borivali and Palghar."

Stress points of democracy ",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/stress-points-of-democracy/article26272814.ece,"
In this election year in India, we need to keep a sharper eye on the weakening of institutions ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"These are difficult, as also unsettling, times. It is not the complexity of issues that confront the world as much as the steady undermining of institutional and knowledge structures that are posing a threat to the world.Across the world, democracy is in obvious retreat, with authoritarian tendencies on the ascendant. Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan are constantly projected as the faces of authoritarianism, but many democratic leaders reveal a similar authoritarian streak, which adds to democracy’s woes. It may be too early to predict the demise of democracy, but the reality is that it is not a good time for democratic institutions, or for those who see democracy as the answer to the world’s problems.Examples everywhereSeveral examples exist worldwide on how decisions today are handed down, rather than being the outcome of discussion and debate. Hallowed international institutions such as the World Bank are facing the heat today for not conforming to the prescriptions of certain powerful members. At the same time, there are enough examples of democracy going awry. Brexit, and the Brexit debate, in the U.K. and Europe is a good example.The U.S., which prides itself as a leading democracy, is setting a bad example today. Under President Donald Trump, arbitrary decision-making has replaced informed debate. His diatribe against what he calls a “ridiculous partisan” investigation against him is an indication. Another is his determination to build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants, even risking an extended shutdown of the U.S. government. The decision of the U.S. to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty — a key pact signed in 1987, and hailed as the centrepiece of European security since the Cold War — without a detailed internal discussion appears to be setting the stage for Cold War 2.0.It is, however, the ignoring of democratic conventions nearer home that are cause for greater concern. In a pluralistic, multi-party federal system, disdain for democratic conventions and the violation of well-entrenched behavioural patterns are causing irreversible damage to the polity.Federal falloutCurrently, we are witnessing vituperative exchanges between the Prime Minister and some Chief Ministers which involve accusations such as fomenting riots and running extortion rackets. This damages the fabric of democracy. Centre-State relations are already under strain, and face the threat of still greater disruption.Selective interpretation of information is a fallout of such situations. Those in authority deem all information not acceptable to them as nothing but disinformation. Those opposed to the government, on the other hand, insist that the government suffers from a lack of probity. The current sulphurous exchanges between the ruling dispensation and the Opposition over the purchase of Rafale aircraft are an example. The casualty is truth, and the veracity of official facts and statistics.Many instances of this kind can be quoted, but one specific instance that has caught the fancy of the public is the current debate on jobs and unemployment. The Central government has effectively rejected a report by the well-regarded National Sample Survey Office — which showed that unemployment in 2017-18 was at a 45-year high — without giving any valid reason for doing so. The government’s only reasoning for rejecting the report is that it is a ‘draft’, which has only added to existing doubts about its real intentions. Similarly, doubts are being raised about the validity of the government’s revised GDP estimates.Breaches of democratic conventions are adding to the already existing disquiet. Adherence to democratic norms has for long been perceived as crucial to maintaining the independence of institutions and processes. An impression exists today that attempts are being made to effect changes in the existing system. Two instances during the past year when the government breached long-held conventions have raised questions about the intentions of those in authority.One was the brouhaha concerning the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and a perceived attempt to reduce its functional independence, to compel it to fall in line with the views of the government. The resignation of the RBI Governor put a temporary quietus to these concerns, but it is widely believed that the RBI has been brought into line with the government’s wishes. The second instance relates to the Interim Budget in an election year. The Interim Budget announced on the eve of the 2019 general election clearly breaches certain long-settled conventions, by including many substantial measures that ordinarily would form part of a regular Budget. The intention is plain, viz. build more support for the ruling dispensation in an election year.Alongside the decline in democratic conventions, another cause for concern is the virtual collapse of key institutions such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Touted as India’s premier investigation agency, its reputation has of late suffered a near mortal blow, mainly on account of internecine quarrels, as also external interference in its internal affairs. Created out of the Delhi Special Police Establishment in 1963, a brainchild of then-Home Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, the agency was earlier headed by persons with impeccable integrity and ability. It had also adhered previously to the salutary principle of not carrying out arrests, except in the most exceptional of circumstances. Over time, the quality of the CBI leadership and the tribe of proven investigators has witnessed a decline, which has impacted the image of the organisation.An agency of the government, part of the Ministry of Personnel functioning under the Prime Minister, supervised at one step removed by the Central Vigilance Commission, and constantly under the watch of the Supreme Court, the CBI serves many masters. The choice of Director, following the Vineet Narain case, by a committee headed by the Prime Minister, with the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of Opposition as the other members, has hardly helped the CBI maintain a reputation for independence. The recent unsavoury drama, which witnessed a ‘Kilkenny cat fight’ between the Director and his No. 2, reflects the lack of institutional culture in the organisation.Compounding the situation arising from the lack of trained and competent investigators is the fact that supervisory officers, who come and go, are most often not in a position to provide proper guidance to investigating officers. At times, they also tend to tinker with the investigation reports sent to them, to reject the findings of investigating officers.A changing work cultureWhat is worse is that while earlier the CBI used to carry out arrests of so-called accused persons only as a measure of last resort, today it is overturning this on its head. As its investigating officers’ skills have declined, it is increasingly resorting to peremptory arrests, often on very slender evidence, in anticipation of securing approvers to build, or strengthen, a case. The law generally disapproves of approver evidence, but this has become the stock in trade of the CBI. In many instances, the CBI has also been resorting to pressure tactics while questioning individuals, even when they are not accused persons, setting aside legal niceties and requirements. In a few instances recently, the CBI has even resorted to intimidatory tactics, taking recourse to a battery of investigators to question a witness, let alone an accused, in the hope of securing useful leads. The recent incident where a posse of CBI personnel went to question the Kolkata Police Commissioner at his residence late in the evening, though he was only a witness, reflects the changing mores of the CBI. This should be a matter of concern for one and all.M.K. Narayanan is a former National Security Advisor and a former Governor of West Bengal"

Suburban and long-distance train services were affected for around four hours due to the protest.According to officials of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) there were more than 500 protesters. The crowd started gathering around 8 a.m., and the tracks were cleared by noon.Preeti Bahot, a commuter from Nallasopara, had to wait for hours for a train. “I reached the station by 8 a.m., as I do every day. I had no clue about the protest, which started around the same time,” she said. Ms. Bahot, who works in Churchgate, said protesters initially also pelted stones, before women on board a local train told them to stop. “The crowd kept increasing and there were easily more than a thousand people at the station. As nobody knew about the protest, commuters kept coming,” she said.Lathi chargeSecurity staff had to resort to lathi charge to clear the crowd. “There was no headway for over three hours, despite a dialogue with protesters,” a senior official said.“We are registering cases against the protesters for unlawful assembly and rioting.

I deal only with individuals. Even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined: Aparna Sen

In a freewheeling chat, ace actor-director Aparna Sen talks about the importance of creative freedom, the subtext in her narratives, and how the actor and director in her inform each other ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Like her films, Aparna Sen has a lot to say. Like her films, it is seldom on the surface; it is only when you process it that you get the essence. The celebrated actor-director was in Delhi recently to participate in an international symposium on ‘Creativity and Freedom’, organised by the Kolkata-based CIMA Gallery, Ashoka University and India International Centre. As a film writer, one is always keen to know what was playing on the director’s mind when she shaped certain characters. For Aparna, one has a long list. From trivial details like why did she name the photographer in “Paroma” as Rahul Rai? Did the fact that Aparna was herself photographed by a celebrated photographer for Life magazine play on her mind when she was writing the Rakhee-starrer? Aparna says, “no”, with a smile. She reveals that she met Raghu Rai much later though she was aware of his work. During the course of the interview, she admits that some things that exist in the subconscious mind do slip into the narrative. Perhaps, it addresses the more complex questions like the bond between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law in her “Paromitar Ek Din” (House of Memories) or giving a woman agency in a communal riot-like situation in “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”.Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the theme: ‘Creativity and Freedom’?Well, not only cinema but in every sphere! I believe this is the raging topic of the day because your creative freedom is being suppressed in so many areas. At the drop of a hat, people have begun to take offence. You can’t write, paint, make films without worrying about some faction or other whose ‘sentiments’ will be hurt! If you critique the state of affairs in your country in any way, you are branded an anti-national. Freedom of expression, which is a fundamental democratic right granted to us by our constitution, is under threat today.Many different groups of people have become more sensitive than they used to be. They are well within their rights to object to something a filmmaker may have said, but they often indulge in rioting or vandalising cinema halls or forcibly stopping entry into theatres. The various state governments, which should be dealing with such law and order problems, put a stay on the release of the film. For a creative person, the atmosphere is stifling!Rahul Bose and Konkana Sensharma in Aparna Sen's English film ""Mr. and Mrs. Iyer"".Did you ever face censorship?During ‘Mr. and Mrs. Iyer’, some dialogues were cut out in Mumbai and Pune if I remember correctly. The consensus was that what had been said about Muslims in the film would enrage them and create law and order problems. But you have to take into account the intent of the film. One person or a character saying something derogatory about a Muslim doesn’t mean that the filmmaker herself is against the community. In fact, she is trying to say that such comments should not be made. Unfortunately, a scene or a piece of dialogue in a film is taken out of context and judged.Your films had female characters at the centre of the narrative much before it became a trend. What were your concerns?Look, I make films about individuals. But I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act. But I don’t make a film as a platform for my politics. My real interest is the psychology of the individual. The individual herself is part of the system, part of many converging political ideologies. When I make a film about a woman, it is possible that my feminist politics surfaces somewhere but it is not with the intention of propagating feminism. I certainly am a feminist but, in my cinema, I don’t talk about any ‘isms’. I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How it has evolved over the years and if we could compare it with the present?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films. But most of them and many feminist filmmakers, in particular, were talking about women negotiating space for themselves in a male-dominated society. Women were mostly shown as persons trying to fulfil their own potential. A notable exception is ‘Mahanagar’ by Satyajit Ray. Here you find a very early feminist narrative where the man and the woman are treated as equal. At the end of the film, when both are without jobs, both stand looking out at the city stretched out before them, and the husband says, ‘In such a great metropolis, surely at least one of us will find a job?’ They are treated as equals by the filmmaker. Even if one of them finds a job, they can function as a family. It is one of the best feminist films I have ever seen.After that, it was more about women trying to realising their own potential and their fight to do so. Any talk about female desire or sexual choice was strictly taboo. That’s why in 1985, my second film ‘Paroma’ created such a furore! Many people wanted it taken out of theatres. They felt that women’s freedom didn’t mean licence for adultery! My point is, licence according to whom? The male-dominated patriarchal system where the moment a woman exercises her sexual choice, it is called a ‘licence?’Today, the situation is completely different. Women filmmakers are now very comfortable in their shoes. They are critiquing women even. They are comfortable making films about male characters, who are persecuted by other males or even females. Alankrita Shrivastava addressed the issue of female desire in ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’. Konkona Sen Sharma made a film (‘Death in the Gunj’) about a young man where the macho world around him bullies him so much that he commits suicide.Film Director and Actress Aparna Sen  
| Photo Credit:R_Shivaji RaoThere is a lot of subtext in your narratives; one could draw different meanings...‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ was about an Anglo-Indian school teacher and her dilemma about remaining in India. She chooses to remain. There is no jingoism here. She is not talking about her motherland,which she will not leave because she is patriotic. It was simply a personal decision of a woman who is unwilling to leave a place she has known all her life. She opts for the country that she was born and brought up in. In that sense, she is a true Indian. So, you can read the text that way too, if you wish. But I made it as a human being’s personal choice, which I find much more interesting. ‘Paroma’ was about a woman who exercised her personal choice and in the process came across the wrath of the family. Eventually, she realises who she is. She realises that she is a person in her own right. To that extent, it was about a woman discovering her own identity.Film director Mrinal Sen

Had she known, she would not have gone. I didn’t plan to make the characters as Hindu and Muslim to start with. I was just going to make a love story about two strangers who meet during a journey. They surfaced because of my deep involvement with secular politics. Meenakshi Iyer tells the rioters that she is the wife of her co-passenger, who is a Muslim, just to save his life. She herself had not known until that moment she would do so! In a physical journey, which is a wonderful metaphor for a journey into oneself, the woman discovers that humanity is more important to her than her caste or religion or gender identities. In spite of so much corruption and violence around us, I still have a deep and abiding faith in human goodness.In some of your films, we find women smoking? Isn’t it bad for both men and women?Of course, it is! But, people do smoke in real life you know! In any case, I haven't shown women smoking that much in my films. Some women do smoke, yes.For a long time, women smoking publicly became a kind of political statement. But, of course, it is bad for you. In ‘Paroma’, one of my characters smokes, but she is not the central character. In ‘Sati’, ‘Yugant’ or ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’, or ‘The Japanese Wife’,for instance, there are no such scenes.In ‘Sonata’, you resisted giving a name to the simmering desire between two women...There really was no ‘simmering desire’. There was just the hint of a grey area. It is left open. I like to leave such things open. Why should I always tell the audience what to think?How much do you invest in your characters?Hugely. In the process of fleshing them out in the script, they take on a life of their own. I had planned on having Violet Stoneham of ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ to go away to Australia in the end. That was then the reality of India in 1981. Anglo-Indians migrated all the time to England, or Australia, New Zealand or Canada. But I just couldn’t make her go! I get very to my characters. In ‘Yugant’, which many outside of Bengal haven’t seen, the dissolution of a marriage was used as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the earth. The couple there were called Deepak and Anusuya. When I was making the film, the shooting went on for a long time as we had no money. In between, I was in New Jersey with my husband and suddenly one night, I started crying. When he asked why, I said, I was missing them so much. He asked, “Who?” ‘Deepak and Anusuya,’ I said, ‘I haven't seen them for so long!’ I get emotionally involved with my characters. I care about how they think. They indicate to me how they should behave or what their dialogue should be.Do the actor and director reside in two different compartments in your body?They merge. The actor comes to the fore when I am writing. I write dialogue, which very few actors have difficulty in speaking. because when I am writing, the actor in me is silently acting it all out in her mind. And when I am directing actors, the actor in me is very helpful. I know exactly what problem the actor is facing. I understand the physical and motivational problems of the actors. If an actor asks me “Why am I saying this?” I can usually tell the actor how he or she can motivate himself/ herself.Is there ever a clash?Only when I am acting and directing at the same time. I had a problem in ‘Sonata’ as I had to keep running to the monitor after giving a shot.What are your memories of Mrinal Sen?To me, he was always a young man, even when he was old. He was mentally the youngest person I have known. Always ready to try something new, always fresh. That was the most wonderful thing about him. He was not afraid of experimenting and that is so necessary in order to develop the language of cinema. He tried to experiment with cinematic form and language as well as subject matter. I worked with him in two films, but he and his wife were family friends as well – friends of my parents.You also tried to experiment in Arshinagar...It is not an easy path because when you are experimenting, you are running into orthodox thought.Like you, it seems Konkona also loves to explore the psychological space of charactersHer form is not too different, but hers is a new voice with a new perspective. She is another person.Is her style more technical?No, I don’t think it is technical. It is removed from the classical format. In the classical format, there is a beginning, a middle and an end. She opens with two people looking into the boot of a car, which is interesting because it is dramatic and intriguing with no formal 'introduction' to the characters as such.Why don't you make films in Hindi?I would love to make a film in Hindi. I don’t want to make it with stars though. I have tried that but it is a pain to pursue stars. In any case, markets are not as star-driven as they used to be. They are much more content driven now.What are you working on?I am making an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Ghare Bairey’(The Home and the World). I have called it ‘Ghaire Bairey Aaj’,because itis set against a contemporary backdrop. It is about how the world outside impacts relationships at home. I don’t want to talk more about it beforehand. I hope it will release in April."

Rhythmic beats of bamboo sticks against wood to matching footsteps will be the much awaited act too. At Octave — the cultural festival of the northeast, visitors will get to see the vibrant colours and music and steps of the people of northeast.Over the years Octave has become synonymous with northeast festivities. The three-day fest (February 14 to 16) is a riot of colours, music and different costumes. One will get to witness Manipur’s Dhol Cholom, Pung Cholom, lai haraoba; Assam Bihu dance and Bhortal; from Tripura it will be the Hojagiri, Sangrai.Clad in Naga shawl and their colourful headgears Khupilili and Roina dance forms of the Naga people will make visitors clap their hands to match the beats.

Stress points of democracy
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stress-points-of-democracy/article26275426.ece,"
In this election year in India, we need to keep a sharper eye on the weakening of institutions
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"These are difficult, as also unsettling, times. It is not the complexity of issues that confront the world as much as the steady undermining of institutional and knowledge structures that are posing a threat to the world.Across the world, democracy is in obvious retreat, with authoritarian tendencies on the ascendant. Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan are constantly projected as the faces of authoritarianism, but many democratic leaders reveal a similar authoritarian streak, which adds to democracy’s woes. It may be too early to predict the demise of democracy, but the reality is that it is not a good time for democratic institutions, or for those who see democracy as the answer to the world’s problems.Examples everywhereSeveral examples exist worldwide on how decisions today are handed down, rather than being the outcome of discussion and debate. Hallowed international institutions such as the World Bank are facing the heat today for not conforming to the prescriptions of certain powerful members. At the same time, there are enough examples of democracy going awry. Brexit, and the Brexit debate, in the U.K. and Europe is a good example.The U.S., which prides itself as a leading democracy, is setting a bad example today. Under President Donald Trump, arbitrary decision-making has replaced informed debate. His diatribe against what he calls a “ridiculous partisan” investigation against him is an indication. Another is his determination to build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants, even risking an extended shutdown of the U.S. government. The decision of the U.S. to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty — a key pact signed in 1987, and hailed as the centrepiece of European security since the Cold War — without a detailed internal discussion appears to be setting the stage for Cold War 2.0.It is, however, the ignoring of democratic conventions nearer home that are cause for greater concern. In a pluralistic, multi-party federal system, disdain for democratic conventions and the violation of well-entrenched behavioural patterns are causing irreversible damage to the polity.Federal falloutCurrently, we are witnessing vituperative exchanges between the Prime Minister and some Chief Ministers which involve accusations such as fomenting riots and running extortion rackets. This damages the fabric of democracy. Centre-State relations are already under strain, and face the threat of still greater disruption.Selective interpretation of information is a fallout of such situations. Those in authority deem all information not acceptable to them as nothing but disinformation. Those opposed to the government, on the other hand, insist that the government suffers from a lack of probity. The current sulphurous exchanges between the ruling dispensation and the Opposition over the purchase of Rafale aircraft are an example. The casualty is truth, and the veracity of official facts and statistics.Many instances of this kind can be quoted, but one specific instance that has caught the fancy of the public is the current debate on jobs and unemployment. The Central government has effectively rejected a report by the well-regarded National Sample Survey Office — which showed that unemployment in 2017-18 was at a 45-year high — without giving any valid reason for doing so. The government’s only reasoning for rejecting the report is that it is a ‘draft’, which has only added to existing doubts about its real intentions. Similarly, doubts are being raised about the validity of the government’s revised GDP estimates.Breaches of democratic conventions are adding to the already existing disquiet. Adherence to democratic norms has for long been perceived as crucial to maintaining the independence of institutions and processes. An impression exists today that attempts are being made to effect changes in the existing system. Two instances during the past year when the government breached long-held conventions have raised questions about the intentions of those in authority.One was the brouhaha concerning the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and a perceived attempt to reduce its functional independence, to compel it to fall in line with the views of the government. The resignation of the RBI Governor put a temporary quietus to these concerns, but it is widely believed that the RBI has been brought into line with the government’s wishes. The second instance relates to the Interim Budget in an election year. The Interim Budget announced on the eve of the 2019 general election clearly breaches certain long-settled conventions, by including many substantial measures that ordinarily would form part of a regular Budget. The intention is plain, viz. build more support for the ruling dispensation in an election year.Alongside the decline in democratic conventions, another cause for concern is the virtual collapse of key institutions such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Touted as India’s premier investigation agency, its reputation has of late suffered a near mortal blow, mainly on account of internecine quarrels, as also external interference in its internal affairs. Created out of the Delhi Special Police Establishment in 1963, a brainchild of then-Home Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, the agency was earlier headed by persons with impeccable integrity and ability. It had also adhered previously to the salutary principle of not carrying out arrests, except in the most exceptional of circumstances. Over time, the quality of the CBI leadership and the tribe of proven investigators has witnessed a decline, which has impacted the image of the organisation.An agency of the government, part of the Ministry of Personnel functioning under the Prime Minister, supervised at one step removed by the Central Vigilance Commission, and constantly under the watch of the Supreme Court, the CBI serves many masters. The choice of Director, following the Vineet Narain case, by a committee headed by the Prime Minister, with the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of Opposition as the other members, has hardly helped the CBI maintain a reputation for independence. The recent unsavoury drama, which witnessed a ‘Kilkenny cat fight’ between the Director and his No. 2, reflects the lack of institutional culture in the organisation.Compounding the situation arising from the lack of trained and competent investigators is the fact that supervisory officers, who come and go, are most often not in a position to provide proper guidance to investigating officers. At times, they also tend to tinker with the investigation reports sent to them, to reject the findings of investigating officers.A changing work cultureWhat is worse is that while earlier the CBI used to carry out arrests of so-called accused persons only as a measure of last resort, today it is overturning this on its head. As its investigating officers’ skills have declined, it is increasingly resorting to peremptory arrests, often on very slender evidence, in anticipation of securing approvers to build, or strengthen, a case. The law generally disapproves of approver evidence, but this has become the stock in trade of the CBI. In many instances, the CBI has also been resorting to pressure tactics while questioning individuals, even when they are not accused persons, setting aside legal niceties and requirements. In a few instances recently, the CBI has even resorted to intimidatory tactics, taking recourse to a battery of investigators to question a witness, let alone an accused, in the hope of securing useful leads. The recent incident where a posse of CBI personnel went to question the Kolkata Police Commissioner at his residence late in the evening, though he was only a witness, reflects the changing mores of the CBI. This should be a matter of concern for one and all.M.K. Narayanan is a former National Security Advisor and a former Governor of West Bengal"

I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How it has evolved over the years and if we could compare it with the present?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films. But most of them and many feminist filmmakers, in particular, were talking about women negotiating space for themselves in a male-dominated society. Women were mostly shown as persons trying to fulfil their own potential. A notable exception is ‘Mahanagar’ by Satyajit Ray. Here you find a very early feminist narrative where the man and the woman are treated as equal. At the end of the film, when both are without jobs, both stand looking out at the city stretched out before them, and the husband says, ‘In such a great metropolis, surely at least one of us will find a job?’ They are treated as equals by the filmmaker. Even if one of them finds a job, they can function as a family. It is one of the best feminist films I have ever seen.After that, it was more about women trying to realising their own potential and their fight to do so. Any talk about female desire or sexual choice was strictly taboo. That’s why in 1985, my second film ‘Paroma’ created such a furore! Many people wanted it taken out of theatres. They felt that women’s freedom didn’t mean licence for adultery! My point is, licence according to whom? The male-dominated patriarchal system where the moment a woman exercises her sexual choice, it is called a ‘licence?’Today, the situation is completely different. Women filmmakers are now very comfortable in their shoes. They are critiquing women even. They are comfortable making films about male characters, who are persecuted by other males or even females. Alankrita Shrivastava addressed the issue of female desire in ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’. Konkona Sen Sharma made a film (‘Death in the Gunj’) about a young man where the macho world around him bullies him so much that he commits suicide.There is a lot of subtext in your narratives; one could draw different meanings...‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ was about an Anglo-Indian school teacher and her dilemma about remaining in India. She chooses to remain. There is no jingoism here. She is not talking about her motherland,which she will not leave because she is patriotic. It was simply a personal decision of a woman who is unwilling to leave a place she has known all her life. She opts for the country that she was born and brought up in. In that sense, she is a true Indian. So, you can read the text that way too, if you wish. But I made it as a human being’s personal choice, which I find much more interesting. ‘Paroma’ was about a woman who exercised her personal choice and in the process came across the wrath of the family. Eventually, she realises who she is. She realises that she is a person in her own right. To that extent, it was about a woman discovering her own identity.In “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”, the female protagonist rises above the barriers of caste and religion for a bigger cause.She was going to Kolkata, and she didn’t know that the bus would be caught in a riot. Had she known, she would not have gone. I didn’t plan to make the characters as Hindu and Muslim to start with. I was just going to make a love story about two strangers who meet during a journey. They surfaced because of my deep involvement with secular politics. Meenakshi Iyer tells the rioters that she is the wife of her co-passenger, who is a Muslim, just to save his life. She herself had not known until that moment she would do so! In a physical journey, which is a wonderful metaphor for a journey into oneself, the woman discovers that humanity is more important to her than her caste or religion or gender identities. In spite of so much corruption and violence around us, I still have a deep and abiding faith in human goodness.In some of your films, we find women smoking? Isn’t it bad for both men and women?Of course, it is! But, people do smoke in real life you know! In any case, I haven't shown women smoking that much in my films. Some women do smoke, yes.For a long time, women smoking publicly became a kind of political statement. But, of course, it is bad for you. In ‘Paroma’, one of my characters smokes, but she is not the central character. In ‘Sati’, ‘Yugant’ or ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’, or ‘The Japanese Wife’,for instance, there are no such scenes.In ‘Sonata’, you resisted giving a name to the simmering desire between two women...There really was no ‘simmering desire’. There was just the hint of a grey area. It is left open. I like to leave such things open. Why should I always tell the audience what to think?How much do you invest in your characters?Hugely. In the process of fleshing them out in the script, they take on a life of their own. I had planned on having Violet Stoneham of ‘36 Chowringhee Lane’ to go away to Australia in the end. That was then the reality of India in 1981. Anglo-Indians migrated all the time to England, or Australia, New Zealand or Canada. But I just couldn’t make her go! I get very to my characters. In ‘Yugant’, which many outside of Bengal haven’t seen, the dissolution of a marriage was used as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the earth. The couple there were called Deepak and Anusuya. When I was making the film, the shooting went on for a long time as we had no money. In between, I was in New Jersey with my husband and suddenly one night, I started crying. When he asked why, I said, I was missing them so much. He asked, “Who?” ‘Deepak and Anusuya,’ I said, ‘I haven't seen them for so long!’ I get emotionally involved with my characters. I care about how they think. They indicate to me how they should behave or what their dialogue should be.Do the actor and director reside in two different compartments in your body?They merge. The actor comes to the fore when I am writing. I write dialogue, which very few actors have difficulty in speaking. because when I am writing, the actor in me is silently acting it all out in her mind. And when I am directing actors, the actor in me is very helpful. I know exactly what problem the actor is facing. I understand the physical and motivational problems of the actors. If an actor asks me “Why am I saying this?” I can usually tell the actor how he or she can motivate himself/ herself.Is there ever a clash?Only when I am acting and directing at the same time. I had a problem in ‘Sonata’ as I had to keep running to the monitor after giving a shot.Like you, it seems Konkona also loves to explore the psychological space of charactersHer form is not too different, but hers is a new voice with a new perspective. She is another person.Is her style more technical?No, I don’t think it is technical. It is removed from the classical format. In the classical format, there is a beginning, a middle and an end. She opens with two people looking into the boot of a car, which is interesting because it is dramatic and intriguing with no formal 'introduction' to the characters as such.Why don't you make films in Hindi?I would love to make a film in Hindi. I don’t want to make it with stars though. I have tried that but it is a pain to pursue stars. In any case, markets are not as star-driven as they used to be. They are much more content driven now.What are you working on?I am making an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Ghare Bairey’(The Home and the World). I have called it ‘Ghaire Bairey Aaj’,because itis set against a contemporary backdrop. It is about how the world outside impacts relationships at home. I don’t want to talk more about it beforehand. I hope it will release in April."

‘I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined’
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/i-deal-only-with-individuals-even-if-an-ism-surfaces-it-is-not-underlined/article26277446.ece,"
In a freewheeling chat, ace actor-director Aparna Sen talks about the importance of creative freedom, the subtext in her narratives, and how the actor and director in her inform each other
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Like her films, Aparna Sen has a lot to say. Like her films, it is seldom on the surface; it is only when you process it that you get the essence. The celebrated actor-director was in Delhi recently to participate in an international symposium on ‘Creativity and Freedom’, organised by the Kolkata-based CIMA Gallery, Ashoka University and India International Centre. As a film writer, one is always keen to know what was playing on the director’s mind when she shaped certain characters. For Aparna, one has a long list. From trivial details like why did she name the photographer in “Paroma” as Rahul Rai? Did the fact that Aparna was herself photographed by a celebrated photographer for Life magazine play on her mind when she was writing the Rakhee-starrer? Aparna says, “no”, with a smile. She reveals that she met Raghu Rai much later though she was aware of his work. During the course of the interview, she admits that some things that exist in the subconscious mind do slip into the narrative. Perhaps, it addresses the more complex questions like the bond between the mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law in her “Paromitar Ek Din” (House of Memories) or giving a woman agency in a communal riot-like situation in “Mr. & Mrs. Iyer”.Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the theme: ‘Creativity and Freedom’?Well, not only cinema but in every sphere! I believe this is the raging topic of the day because your creative freedom is being suppressed in so many areas. At the drop of a hat, people have begun to take offence. You can’t write, paint, make films without worrying about some faction or other whose ‘sentiments’ will be hurt! If you critique the state of affairs in your country in any way, you are branded an anti-national. Freedom of expression, which is a fundamental democratic right granted to us by our constitution, is under threat today.Many different groups of people have become more sensitive than they used to be. They are well within their rights to object to something a filmmaker may have said, but they often indulge in rioting or vandalising cinema halls or forcibly stopping entry into theatres. The various state governments, which should be dealing with such law and order problems, put a stay on the release of the film. For a creative person, the atmosphere is stifling!Did you ever face censorship?During ‘Mr. and Mrs. Iyer’, some dialogues were cut out in Mumbai and Pune if I remember correctly. The consensus was that what had been said about Muslims in the film would enrage them and create law and order problems. But you have to take into account the intent of the film. One person or a character saying something derogatory about a Muslim doesn’t mean that the filmmaker herself is against the community. In fact, she is trying to say that such comments should not be made. Unfortunately, a scene or a piece of dialogue in a film is taken out of context and judged.Your films had female characters at the centre of the narrative much before it became a trend. What were your concerns?Look, I make films about individuals. But I do have my politics. No person is apolitical. The very act of voting is a political act. But I don’t make a film as a platform for my politics. My real interest is the psychology of the individual. The individual herself is part of the system, part of many converging political ideologies. When I make a film about a woman, it is possible that my feminist politics surfaces somewhere but it is not with the intention of propagating feminism. I certainly am a feminist but, in my cinema, I don’t talk about any ‘isms’. I deal only with individuals; even if an ‘ism’ surfaces, it is not underlined.How it has evolved over the years and if we could compare it with the present?It is very interesting because earlier when we were making such films, many men were also making women-centric films.

Some passengers, who got out of the airport, approached the Ola Cab counter to book a taxi.A group of airport taxi drivers followed the passengers and reportedly questioned them for booking the cab at the counter. Then, the group allegedly abused Shet and assaulted him.Following the complaint, the Bajpe police arrested Mohammed Tasin, 50, Abdul Rahiman, 41, Usman, 38, for offences under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 323 (volutarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongfully restraining any person), 504 (insult intended to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code."

Alone on Valentine’s Day? That doesn’t mean you can’t treat yourself and your inner-techie
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"That wonderful day known as Valentine’s Day is the perfect excuse for couples to profess their love for each other. In small ways like ﬂowers and gifts, and in big gestures, like expensive dinners or romantic getaways.Either way, V-Day can be hard on all those single people. That does not need to be the case though, Valentine’s is about love and nothing says ‘I love myself’ more than gifting yourself a gadget companion. Here are some ideas.Just what the heart needsValentine’s Day is all about those matters of the heart, ﬁguratively. Why not take that meaning to a more literal level and buy yourself that Apple Watch 4 you’ve been lusting for, for so long. You see, under its sleek exterior lies an ECG, an electrocardiogram, that sends pulses to your heart to measure its health.Pinging you with advice when it notices any irregularities and even going as far as to alerting emergency services when you’re in danger of cardiac arrests. Plus, it’s nifty that it’s got that breathing reminder. Get yourself what your heart wants this V-Day.Crush on these assistantsNo matter how much you shy away from digital assistants, they are a riot. Even if they may one day take over the world as prophesied byThe Terminator, that’s a long way oﬀ, and while they’ve not evolved to the levels of the robots inEx-MachinaandHer, to be able to romance, they’re still fun to talk to.You can ask them any trivia question, dictate messages, ask them the time or to play music for you, they can tell you silly jokes and remind you of things you need to do. If you have a smart connected home, they can keep that temperature controlled and those lights nice and ambient. Who knows, not far into the future you may be able to actually converse with them. Till then, they’re a great voice to have in an empty house.Forget true love — go true wirelessFree yourself from pesky wire clutter and take that plunge into true wireless. A go-to are Apple’s AirPods and the excellent Samsung Gear IconX for Android if you want to stay speciﬁc to the platform.However, if you want to stand out a bit, Jabra’s snazzy Elite 65T series is way better in both sound quality and ﬁt, they come in snazzy colours and models too. The gorgeous blue-and-gold Elite Active brings in motion detection and water resistance. The Elite Sport brings a better ﬁt for the rigours of working out.A little Tinder loving careNot down to holding hands? Treat yourself to a brand new phone, so you can download Tinder and get started. There are plenty of good aﬀordable phones out there. The OnePlus 6T has some incredible features and an ultra-fast 10GB RAM-equipped McLaren Edition to boost your swiping right.Huawei has got some incredible camera technology with its Mate 20 Pro’s 40 MP camera and its brand new Honor View 20’s unique colours and that same 40 MP camera, both tuned by Leica. iOS junkies can invest in the iPhone XS and XS Max or the iPhone XR which is slightly lower-end, but still good. If they’re too expensive — which they are — you could get a good deal on an iPhone X or 8 series.Size mattersIf you love the idea of curling up on the couch watching rom-coms, then why not treat yourself to a massive screen? Xiaomi has pretty good 4K 55-inch Mi TVs. If you want something bigger, there’s a 65-inch 4K from Vu.Now if you want to go bigger, then why not go for a projector? You can get a higher-end projector which gives 1080p and can project a larger than 75-inch image.Block out the hatersIf you peg Valentine’s Day as nothing but one big marketing ploy, then this gift for yourself could go against that very philosophy — but it’s worth every penny. One of the best noise-cancelling headphones on the market, the Sony 1000XM3 can blot out all those pesky Valentine’s Day noises so you can jam on your own tunes.They cost upwards of ₹30,000, but are packed with an incredible sound signature, extremely comfortable earpads and the noise-cancelling does not feel like you’re constantly coming down an elevator from the 100th ﬂoor. Just cup the earpiece and the music dims enough to hear what people are talking and then get back into your bubble. There are cheaper options for noise-cancelling; you can get Bose QuietComforts for a little less and TaoTronics and Cowin have budget noise-cancelling options."

We Just Want Our Rights”. In it, the former veterinary student detailed how the impoverished northwest, along the Afghan border, has been “desolated” in Pakistan’s long fight with militancy. He described his group, the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), as “peaceful”.“We held numerous sit-ins and protests and continued to hope that Pakistan’s leaders would try to address our concerns. Instead, they responded with intimidation and violence,” he wrote. “After every major protest, police arrests and charges PTM activists and supporters with rioting, treason or terrorism,” he continued.He also accused the security establishment of ensuring that “almost nothing is reported about our movement in the mainstream Pakistani newspapers and television networks”.The piece was “removed for print by our publishing alliance in Pakistan.The New York Timesand its editorial staff had no role in its removal,” a note at the bottom of the empty-single column on the front page said.The paper is printed in Pakistan by the local English-languageExpress Tribune, which regularly censorsNYTarticles."

Uighurs appeal to China to post videos of relatives in camps

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.“China, show us their videos if they are alive!” Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter. He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated 1 million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution.Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centers where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education. Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism.In a rare show of public criticism from a majority Muslim nation, Turkey on Saturday called China’s treatment of Uighurs “a great cause of shame for humanity.” Citing reports of Heyit’s death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the “concentration camps” and “systematic assimilation” to which Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang are subject.At a regular press briefing Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey’s statement “a very bad mistake.”The video shows Heyit in a gray sweater against a nondescript, gray wall. He states his name and gives the date as Feb. 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused.The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed.Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are unable to contact relatives still in Xinjiang . Fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive.The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media. On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings.If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

We Just Want Our Rights”. In it, the former veterinary student detailed how the impoverished northwest, along the Afghan border, has been “desolated” in Pakistan’s long fight with militancy. He described his group, the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), as “peaceful”.“We held numerous sit-ins and protests and continued to hope that Pakistan’s leaders would try to address our concerns. Instead, they responded with intimidation and violence,” he wrote. “After every major protest, police arrests and charges PTM activists and supporters with rioting, treason or terrorism,” he continued.He also accused the security establishment of ensuring that “almost nothing is reported about our movement in the mainstream Pakistani newspapers and television networks”.The piece was “removed for print by our publishing alliance in Pakistan.The New York Timesand its editorial staff had no role in its removal,” a note at the bottom of the empty-single column on the front page said.The paper is printed in Pakistan by the local English-languageExpress Tribune, which regularly censorsNYTarticles."

Anne-Claire Lévêque and Emilie Camatte are working towards bringing out a book of French idioms with contributions from French students at Alliance Française
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Stooped over a sheaf of colourful papers — vigorously scrubbing, rewriting and cross-checking — is a motley group of French language enthusiasts. They are constructing French idioms through illustrations. Writer and freelance journalist, Anne-Claire Lévêque and illustrator and artist, Emilie Camatte, stand by, observing and occasionally throwing suggestions to the eager students. It’s a riot of paints, colour pencils, papers and references at the Alliance Française of Madras library on a Friday afternoon. This is a step towards bringing out a book of idioms, compiling all the contributions from the various centres at the end of their tour in India, in association with Alliance Française.“The idea is to integrate French expressions and their meanings, to learn about them,” says the duo, adding laughingly that they are running on four hours of sleep and might not be coherent enough. I ask about the full-day workshop: While Anne-Claire suggests creating conversations through the idioms, Emilie recreates the expressions through simple motifs. As they whip out pieces of paper, replete with illustrations that compliment the expressions, they tell me, that it is their first collaborative effort. Between broken English and generous droppings of unfamiliar French words, they begin to tell me their stories.Emilie has been to India almost four times now. And so, it is only justified that her illustrations draw from Indian aesthetics — the culture, ‘crowd’ (as she puts it), colours and fabrics. Though none of her books are available in translation in India, her content oscillates widely between documentation and imagination. She says, “I am drawing parts from what I see in my mind. Most often these are stories within a story,” adding, “always inspired by reality”. Emilie currently has four works that are heavily inspired by India. “People here, keep their senses open. I had gone to Rajasthan and was overwhelmed by the colours and fabrics they use,” she says, recalling the time when trains fascinated her, with its crowded compartments and vendors shouting ‘chai, chai, chai’— a collage of stories. She also collects the fabrics which later make appearances in the books.Anne-Claire, on the other hand, used to “breathe books” from childhood. But after an illustrious career as a freelance journalist, she decided to venture into writing children’s’ books. She prefers writing fiction over reportage, any day. “I still live in my childhood imagination. Kids have a big world of possibilities, when you are an adult this world shrinks,” she observes, adding that like children, she too tends to see situations from different perspectives. Her writing, does not take refuge in the magical and supernatural. Rather, she looks at everyday life situations and finds a narrative in it. Her first book which was published in 1998Attention ala marchel(Watch Your Step!), was born out of her observation of people dancing at a party. Their body movements spurred her into a weaving a story. She adds, “For me, words matter the most. The sound of words and the way they look on paper inspire me.”Before they take leave, Emilie quickly lets me run my eyes through her book,Niranjana veut aller à l'école(Niranjana wants to go to School). The patterns and colours are familiar. I spot turbans, curtains and clothes. The faces too, are familiar. As they leave for Puducherry for their next session, Anne-Claire says, “The responses were great from all around India. We will be back with the book soon.”Books of yoreRoald Dahl’sThe Twitswas triggered by his desire to ‘do something against beards’ – he had an acute dislike for them."

Writer stresses need for women to attain absolute freedom
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Noted fiction writer K.R. Meera has said the world over, women are among prime victims of mobocracy.Elections to the local bodies in Nagaland got stuck at women’s reservation issue for a very long time now as the tribal leaders of Nagaland took to the streets against reservation. But later it was found out that they were just using it as a red herring to avoid elections. The current plight of women of the politically-conscious Kerala is same as that of those Naga women, she said at the Krithi Knowledge Festival here on Monday.“In Kerala, as a child, instead of learning mathematics and science, I should have learnt thanthra samuchaya, naishtika brahmacharya, and the like,” she said, mockingly. “The lessons on history and civics we learnt as children have no value now as the present demand is for knowledge of the rituals around menstruation. Aren’t the mobocracy of the 16 types of tribes in Nagaland and the agitation on the streets of Kerala against the Supreme Court judgement similar?” she asked.Until women attain absolute freedom, mobocracy will not end. Unless they proclaim their citizenship, future generations they bring forth will also have to continue facing moral policing, sexual harassment and sex racketing, drug abuses, gang rapes, and communal riots. This is the emotional threat of mobocracy,” she said."

A tale of how two kittens wormed their way into the Anil family’s hearts ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In an unusual twist of animal love, 33-year-old Ashwinii Anil always had an affinity for black cats. Unfortunately, most people consider black cats inauspicious, going so far as to use them in barbaric sacrificial rituals. In spite of her love for them, Anil was always cautious about adopting a pet. With two young kids: a mildly autistic six-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter, the single mum hardly had any time. Still, she’d do her part for animal-kind and rescue injured street animals, treat them and get them adopted or release them in their place.For years, Anil continued with the practice, until she encountered a tiny ginger kitten. Found all alone in a garden, he was emaciated with an abscess. Anil immediately knew what she had to do. “I didn’t have any intention of keeping him,” she says. “Somebody had abandoned him because he knew how to use the litter box.” Surprisingly, the kitten now named Michan (after a character on the show Doraemon) fit right in with Anil’s family, abating all her wariness of keeping pets. Even though she had Michan, the mother-of-two still desired a black kitten. As if the stars aligned, a few days after Michan was officially adopted by Anil, she saw a post for Kali. “She was only 45 days old and Michan was three months old,” says Anil. “She was tiny but powerful and fierce.”Initially, all was not well in the household when the two met. Michan and Kali fought tooth and nail for a whole week. “Now Michan is not interested in us at all and only wants to play with Kali,” laughs Anil. Both her kids too, have become attached to the kittens, extremely entertained with the duo’s mischievous ways.Kali is very graceful, independent and “likes to play by herself the whole day,” says Anil. “But at night she has to sleep in my blanket.” On the other hand, Michan, like most ginger cats, is rambunctious and loves to trouble his feline sibling. “He used to be so attached to me before Kali,” says Anil wistfully but concedes that together the two cats are a riot."

For tourists, India a ‘chaos’ they love to explore
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/for-tourists-india-a-chaos-they-love-to-explore/article26232047.ece,"
Most visitors don't buy the stereotypes about the country, but they do remain wary of touts and strangers
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With the rising number of travel vloggers visiting India, relaying “10 things that blew their minds”, another 10 that they “hated” and everything in between, tourists visiting the country now have a lot more information to access before starting on their journey. And while no two people have the same experience, for those visiting Delhi, especially for the first time, a cultural shock is almost inevitable.“It’s Chaotic,” exclaimed Fie, from Berlin, who is on her first trip to India, along with a group of friends.“In Europe there are rules. Things are ordered. Here, people do whatever they want. You would never see a car moving in the wrong direction or people crossing the street like this there,” she said. Ani from Albania, who has been in the country only for a week, said: “I feel like I have been travelling for a year and have seen 20 cities. There’s so much here, it’s like everything is rolled up into one.”For a Caucasian in India, getting stared at on the streets is a given, but now strangers walking up to them to take selfies is also a regular affair. Boris, also from Berlin, said that he gets approached by at least two people everyday who want to click a selfie with him. “But it’s more like they are curious, not aggressive,” he added.Commenting on the selfie requests, Losha from St. Petersburg said: “It’s funny, it’s not like they even want to have a conversation. They just take a picture and leave.”Safety concernsSeveral tourists said they had been warned about safety issues, women getting raped and tourists being scammed, before visiting the countryBut as Ani put it, “There are similar stereotypes about my country too, but I don’t think they are true. It has more to do with being careful and depends on the situation.”However, scams are a problem, said drivers of tourist cabs parked on Janpath Road, where several luxury hotels are located. “You won’t believe the amount of fraud that takes place on this road,” said Sukhbir, a cab driver. “They have a system where the touts tie up with auto drivers. They tell them [tourists] that there are riots happening up ahead and it’s not safe to travel there. They then trick people into going to hotels and shops they are associated with.”He also claimed that the police are hand in glove with the touts. “They (touts) have gone underground now because of some recent incident but they’ll be back soon,” he said. “It kills our business, but more than that it brings the country a bad name,” he added.Fake toursJustyana from Poland said things like being taken on a fake tour or hotels not turning out to be what they promise is common, but she's cautious enough not to give out personal information.“They are always asking for your details about where you are staying and things like that and trying to tell you that they will take you to a better place.”Touts can be persistent, said Antti from Finland.“They have an odd way of trying to sell things to you. They don’t get to the point immediately. They will try to engage you in a conversation, get information and then after a while tell you ‘oh you should come to my friend’s hotel or my brother’s store’. In Jaipur we encountered one guy who did this and kept walking with us for the longest time even after we said no,” he said.Most people are not too bothered by street vendors.“We just ignore them and keep walking. But it’s hard to say no to kids,” said Justyana.“But even with these things, like charging extra for a rickshaw ride, or hotel or some street items, it’s not so expensive and it’s not such a big deal,” she added.Learning experienceThe more time spent travelling, however, helps you navigate the country better. For instance, Yaov Ben Zaken, an Israeli tour guide who’s been bringing tourists to the country for several years now, is friends with the street merchants selling cheap necklaces and wallets near the art and craft emporiums on Janpath Road.“These people aren’t really scamming anyone. They’re just trying to make a little money to feed their children and live their lives,” he said. Zaken has travelled the world and his constant advice to tourists is to not be judgmental “...About the smell, the clothes, the poverty. Visit a new place, experience its culture, you will learn something.”"

Caught between two extremisms
",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/caught-between-two-extremisms/article26231338.ece,"
Wahhabi influence and Hindu nationalism are responsible for the radicalisation of a small segment of Muslim youth ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"News reports about occasional acts of terrorism outside of Jammu and Kashmir, which for historical reasons forms a special case, attributed to young Indian Muslims have appeared intermittently in the press. In addition, several recent reports suggest that global jihadi organisations such as the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) have recruited a few Indian Muslim youth primarily by exploiting the latter’s local grievances to serve their own global goals.Many analysts, Indian and foreign, had assumed until recently that Indian Muslims were immune to extremist propaganda because of both the syncretic and moderate nature of Indian Islam and the democratic and secular character of the country which made them feel they were equal participants in the political process. Both these assumptions are now problematic, as several factors have been at work in the past three decades that challenge this conventional wisdom.Wahhabi influenceThe first is the increasing influence of Saudi Wahhabism and related forms of Salafism on Islam as practised in the Indian subcontinent. This is the result of several inter-related variables but the most important of these is the vast increase in employment opportunities in the energy-rich West Asian countries following the oil boom of the 1970s. This resulted in many Indians of all faiths temporarily locating to these countries in search of higher earnings. While a much larger number of Indians belonging to other religions moved to West Asia in search of lucrative jobs, both white and blue-collar, the religio-cultural impact of the encounter with the fundamentalist form of Islam followed in these countries, especially Saudi Arabia, on a section of Indian Muslim emigrants was qualitatively different.Several of these temporary migrants returned to India enamoured with the obscurantist ethos of these oil-rich countries. This fascination was publicly exhibited above all in the adoption by a section of Muslim women, often under patriarchal pressure, of an ultraconservative dress code, including the niqab, or full face covering, popular in Saudi Arabia and some other West Asian countries. This dress code is very different from the traditional concept of purdah (covering up or modesty) practised by conservative Muslim families in the Indian subcontinent.Protected by SufismBut this display of presumed orthodoxy constituted merely the tip of the iceberg. The impact of Wahhabi/Salafi Islam on the mindset of a segment of returnees, who also passed on their preferences to a much larger group of relatives and acquaintances already impressed by the former’s newly acquired prosperity, was more profound. Islamic beliefs and practices among some Indian Muslims began to approximate the harsh Wahhabi dogma, which stands in stark contrast to the indigenous version of Islam in India. The vast majority of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent belong to the Hanafi sect based on the most liberal school of Islamic jurisprudence.Moreover, traditionally Indian Islam has been greatly influenced by Sufi teachings and is, therefore, tolerant and accepting of religious diversity. Visitors to major Sufi shrines, such as those of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer and Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi, where people of all confessions come to pray and seek blessings, can testify to the syncretic spirit of Indian Islam. Consequently, it harbours natural defences against extremism in belief and practice. The ideological infiltration of Wahhabism/Salafism has eroded some of these defences and made a section of Muslims more insular and, therefore, open to extremist ideas.Equally important, the spectacular rise of Hindutva or Hindu nationalism from the 1990s has had a major psychological impact on a section of Muslim youth, prompting their estrangement from the national mainstream. Inter-religious riots in which Muslims suffered disproportionately had been common in India since Independence. In some cases the police killed Muslim youth in fake encounters. The Hashimpura massacre in Uttar Pradesh by members of the Provincial Armed Constabulary in 1987 was the most macabre example of such incidents.However, until the 1990s the vast majority of Indian Muslims treated such occurrences as aberrations and their belief in the secular and non-discriminatory character of the Indian state remained unshaken. The demolition in 1992 of the Babri mosque by a Hindu mob under the direction of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) luminaries and the riots that ensued, in which scores of Muslims lost their lives, shook the confidence of many Muslims in the secular character of the Indian state. What was most galling was the Central government’s apathy in the face of this brazen act of mob violence despite the fact that it had been forewarned. This event began the process of alienation among a section of Muslim youth from the Indian state.This feeling grew exponentially a decade later in 2002 with the massacre of about 1,000 Muslims in Gujarat under BJP rule to avenge the death of 59 kar sevaks who were burnt to death in a train at Godhra after an altercation with local Muslims. What added insult to injury was the inaction, or, as the Human Rights Watch report on the bloodbath put it, the refusal of the state machinery to protect Muslim citizens.More recently, the disenchantment caused by these earlier events has been reinforced by the lynching of several Muslims in northern and central India on the pretext that they were taking cows for slaughter or eating beef. The lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri, in western Uttar Pradesh, in 2015 on suspicion that he had stored beef in his house was the most chilling example of such incidents. It was followed by additional acts of mob violence carried out with relative impunity by the so-called gau rakshak (cow protector) vigilantes. Such incidents have led to a widespread feeling among Indian Muslims that the state, instead of providing security to them, now colludes with those determined to intimidate them into submission. This series of actions and reactions makes it evident that the growth of Hindu nationalism has acted as a major stimulus for the radicalisation of a section of Muslim society in India and that the two phenomena feed off each other.Onus on governing elitesOpinion leaders and religious scholars from within the Muslim community have the primary duty to confront and defeat the malign Wahhabi-Salafi influence on Indian Muslims in order to preserve the liberal and syncretic nature of Indian Islam thus pre-empting the spread of extremist ideology among Muslim youth. However, the impact of the growth of Hindu nationalism on the Muslim psyche can be countered only by the policies and actions of the governing elites at the Centre and in the States. Only they can take concrete steps, such as quick and impartial action against those responsible for creating mayhem in the name of religion, to reassure Muslims that the state will not shirk its responsibility of providing them physical security and ensuring that they are treated with fairness and dignity. This will be the best antidote to the percolation of radical ideas among Muslim youth by removing their sense of alienation from the Indian state that in the long run can threaten the country’s security.Mohammed Ayoob is University Distinguished Professor Emeritus of International Relations, Michigan State University and Non-Resident Senior Fellow, Center for Global Policy, Washington DC"

I came here to remind you of the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act,” he said.Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was one of the first Opposition leaders to visit the fast venue, said the Prime Minister had made a habit of lying on the special status. “He goes to Andhra Pradesh, he lies about the special status. He goes to the North-East, he tells another lie over there. He has absolutely got no credibility left,” Mr. Gandhi said.Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said the No-Confidence Motion moved by the TDP had brought the Opposition together. “This is not a fight of any one political party, it is not a fight of the TDP or TMC alone. This is a fight to save the Constitution, to save secularism and to save the nation,” he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “One may have voted for any party but after elections, whoever wins and becomes the CM, is the CM of the entire State and not of a particular party. Similarly, when one becomes the PM, then he is the PM of the entire country, not just one party. The way PM Modi treats governments of Opposition parties in States, he behaves like he is not the PM of India but the PM of Pakistan.”Mr. Naidu was seen showing the clippings of his exchanges with Mr. Modi in Andhra Pradesh to all the political leaders who came. National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said the Prime Minister had stooped so low as to make personal remarks against Mr. Naidu. “The Jammu-Srinagar highway is closed for six days. They cannot clear the 30km road, but they want to rule the country,” he added.Just cause, says DMKStating that Mr. Naidu was fighting for a just cause, DMK leader Siva said the Modi government would be ousted in three months. He also reminded the gathering that Mr. Naidu had played a vital role in the earlier coalition governments. “The powers of the State are being encroached upon,” he said.Loktantrik Janata Dal chief Sharad Yadav said the Modi-Shah claim that the Opposition has no prime ministerial face is grounded in ignorance. “In 1996 or 1989 we did not have any prime ministerial face and yet we managed to win the election and find a credible candidate,” he added.Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Ahmed Patel and Jairam Ramesh were also at the venue to express their support. Among others who met Mr. Naidu were former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, NCP’s Majeed Memon, JD (S) chief Deve Gowda, Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and BJP rebel Shatrughan Sinha.On Tuesday, Mr. Naidu, along with ministers, MPs and legislators, will march from Andhra Bhawan to Jantar Mantar before meeting President of India Ram Nath Kovind at noon."

But after an illustrious career as a freelance journalist, she decided to venture into writing children’s’ books. She prefers writing fiction over reportage, any day. “I still live in my childhood imagination. Kids have a big world of possibilities, when you are an adult this world shrinks,” she observes, adding that like children, she too tends to see situations from different perspectives. Her writing, does not take refuge in the magical and supernatural. Rather, she looks at everyday life situations and finds a narrative in it. Her first book which was published in 1998Attention ala marchel(Watch Your Step!), was born out of her observation of people dancing at a party. Their body movements spurred her into a weaving a story. She adds, “For me, words matter the most. The sound of words and the way they look on paper inspire me.”Before they take leave, Emilie quickly lets me run my eyes through her book,Niranjana veut aller à l'école(Niranjana wants to go to School). The patterns and colours are familiar. I spot turbans, curtains and clothes. The faces too, are familiar. As they leave for Puducherry for their next session, Anne-Claire says, “The responses were great from all around India. We will be back with the book soon.”"

For tourists, India a ‘chaos’ they love to explore

Most visitorsdon't buy the stereotypes about the country, but they do remain wary of toutsand strangers
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With the rising number of travel vloggers visiting India, relaying “10 things that blew their minds”, another 10 that they “hated” and everything in between, tourists visiting the country now have a lot more information to access before starting on their journey. And while no two people have the same experience, for those visiting Delhi, especially for the first time, a cultural shock is almost inevitable.“It’s Chaotic,” exclaimed Fie, from Berlin, who is on her first trip to India, along with a group of friends.“In Europe there are rules. Things are ordered. Here, people do whatever they want. You would never see a car moving in the wrong direction or people crossing the street like this there,” she said. Ani from Albania, who has been in the country only for a week, said: “I feel like I have been travelling for a year and have seen 20 cities. There’s so much here, it’s like everything is rolled up into one.”For a Caucasian in India, getting stared at on the streets is a given, but now strangers walking up to them to take selfies is also a regular affair. Boris, also from Berlin, said that he gets approached by at least two people everyday who want to click a selfie with him. “But it’s more like they are curious, not aggressive,” he added.Commenting on the selfie requests, Losha from St. Petersburg said: “It’s funny, it’s not like they even want to have a conversation. They just take a picture and leave.”Safety concernsSeveral tourists said they had been warned about safety issues, women getting raped and tourists being scammed, before visiting the countryBut as Ani put it, “There are similar stereotypes about my country too, but I don’t think they are true. It has more to do with being careful and depends on the situation.”However, scams are a problem, said drivers of tourist cabs parked on Janpath Road, where several luxury hotels are located. “You won’t believe the amount of fraud that takes place on this road,” said Sukhbir, a cab driver. “They have a system where the touts tie up with auto drivers. They tell them [tourists] that there are riots happening up ahead and it’s not safe to travel there. They then trick people into going to hotels and shops they are associated with.”He also claimed that the police are hand in glove with the touts. “They (touts) have gone underground now because of some recent incident but they’ll be back soon,” he said. “It kills our business, but more than that it brings the country a bad name,” he added.Fake toursJustyana from Poland said things like being taken on a fake tour or hotels not turning out to be what they promise is common, but she's cautious enough not to give out personal information.“They are always asking for your details about where you are staying and things like that and trying to tell you that they will take you to a better place.”Touts can be persistent, said Antti from Finland.“They have an odd way of trying to sell things to you. They don’t get to the point immediately. They will try to engage you in a conversation, get information and then after a while tell you ‘oh you should come to my friend’s hotel or my brother’s store’. In Jaipur we encountered one guy who did this and kept walking with us for the longest time even after we said no,” he said.Most people are not too bothered by street vendors.“We just ignore them and keep walking. But it’s hard to say no to kids,” said Justyana.“But even with these things, like charging extra for a rickshaw ride, or hotel or some street items, it’s not so expensive and it’s not such a big deal,” she added.Learning experienceThe more time spent travelling, however, helps you navigate the country better. For instance, Yaov Ben Zaken, an Israeli tour guide who’s been bringing tourists to the country for several years now, is friends with the street merchants selling cheap necklaces and wallets near the art and craft emporiums on Janpath Road.“These people aren’t really scamming anyone. They’re just trying to make a little money to feed their children and live their lives,” he said. Zaken has travelled the world and his constant advice to tourists is to not be judgmental “...About the smell, the clothes, the poverty. Visit a new place, experience its culture, you will learn something.”"

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Turkey has called China’s treatment of its minority Uighurs “a great cause of shame for humanity.”In a statement on Saturday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said it’s “no longer a secret” that China has arbitrarily detained more than a million Uighurs in “concentration camps.” He said the Turkic Muslim population faced pressure and “systematic assimilation” in western China.Mr. Aksoy said Turkey has shared with China its position on “all levels” and urged authorities to close the detention facilities and respect human rights.The minister said Turkey had also learned of the death in prison of famed Uighur musician and poet Abdurehim Heyit, who had been sentenced to eight years over one of his songs.“This tragedy has further reinforced the reaction of the Turkish public opinion toward serious human rights violations committed in the Xinjiang region,” Mr. Aksoy said.“We expect this legitimate response to be taken into account by the Chinese authorities. We respectfully commemorate Abdurehim Heyit and all our kinsmen who lost their lives defending their Turkish and Muslim identity,” Mr. Aksoy said.Beijing has intensified a security clampdown on Uighurs in the northwestern region of Xinjiang that was put in place after a bloody 2009 riot. Droves of Uighurs have fled, many traveling to Turkey, where the language and culture are similar to that in Xinjiang.After months of denying their existence, Chinese authorities under increasing outside pressure acknowledged the system of camps, terming them vocational training centers. They have provided little or no information on how many are interned within them and how long they are being held.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had once accused China of “genocide” but has since established closer diplomatic and economic relations with Beijing."

Caught between two extremisms

Wahhabi influence and Hindu nationalism are responsible for the radicalisation of a small segment of Muslim youth
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"News reports about occasional acts of terrorism outside of Jammu and Kashmir, which for historical reasons forms a special case, attributed to young Indian Muslims have appeared intermittently in the press. In addition, several recent reports suggest that global jihadi organisations such as the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) have recruited a few Indian Muslim youth primarily by exploiting the latter’s local grievances to serve their own global goals.Many analysts, Indian and foreign, had assumed until recently that Indian Muslims were immune to extremist propaganda because of both the syncretic and moderate nature of Indian Islam and the democratic and secular character of the country which made them feel they were equal participants in the political process. Both these assumptions are now problematic, as several factors have been at work in the past three decades that challenge this conventional wisdom.Wahhabi influenceThe first is the increasing influence of Saudi Wahhabism and related forms of Salafism on Islam as practised in the Indian subcontinent. This is the result of several inter-related variables but the most important of these is the vast increase in employment opportunities in the energy-rich West Asian countries following the oil boom of the 1970s. This resulted in many Indians of all faiths temporarily locating to these countries in search of higher earnings. While a much larger number of Indians belonging to other religions moved to West Asia in search of lucrative jobs, both white and blue-collar, the religio-cultural impact of the encounter with the fundamentalist form of Islam followed in these countries, especially Saudi Arabia, on a section of Indian Muslim emigrants was qualitatively different.Several of these temporary migrants returned to India enamoured with the obscurantist ethos of these oil-rich countries. This fascination was publicly exhibited above all in the adoption by a section of Muslim women, often under patriarchal pressure, of an ultraconservative dress code, including the niqab, or full face covering, popular in Saudi Arabia and some other West Asian countries. This dress code is very different from the traditional concept of purdah (covering up or modesty) practised by conservative Muslim families in the Indian subcontinent.Protected by SufismBut this display of presumed orthodoxy constituted merely the tip of the iceberg. The impact of Wahhabi/Salafi Islam on the mindset of a segment of returnees, who also passed on their preferences to a much larger group of relatives and acquaintances already impressed by the former’s newly acquired prosperity, was more profound. Islamic beliefs and practices among some Indian Muslims began to approximate the harsh Wahhabi dogma, which stands in stark contrast to the indigenous version of Islam in India. The vast majority of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent belong to the Hanafi sect based on the most liberal school of Islamic jurisprudence.Moreover, traditionally Indian Islam has been greatly influenced by Sufi teachings and is, therefore, tolerant and accepting of religious diversity. Visitors to major Sufi shrines, such as those of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer and Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi, where people of all confessions come to pray and seek blessings, can testify to the syncretic spirit of Indian Islam. Consequently, it harbours natural defences against extremism in belief and practice. The ideological infiltration of Wahhabism/Salafism has eroded some of these defences and made a section of Muslims more insular and, therefore, open to extremist ideas.Equally important, the spectacular rise of Hindutva or Hindu nationalism from the 1990s has had a major psychological impact on a section of Muslim youth, prompting their estrangement from the national mainstream. Inter-religious riots in which Muslims suffered disproportionately had been common in India since Independence. In some cases the police killed Muslim youth in fake encounters. The Hashimpura massacre in Uttar Pradesh by members of the Provincial Armed Constabulary in 1987 was the most macabre example of such incidents.However, until the 1990s the vast majority of Indian Muslims treated such occurrences as aberrations and their belief in the secular and non-discriminatory character of the Indian state remained unshaken. The demolition in 1992 of the Babri mosque by a Hindu mob under the direction of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) luminaries and the riots that ensued, in which scores of Muslims lost their lives, shook the confidence of many Muslims in the secular character of the Indian state. What was most galling was the Central government’s apathy in the face of this brazen act of mob violence despite the fact that it had been forewarned. This event began the process of alienation among a section of Muslim youth from the Indian state.This feeling grew exponentially a decade later in 2002 with the massacre of about 1,000 Muslims in Gujarat under BJP rule to avenge the death of 59 kar sevaks who were burnt to death in a train at Godhra after an altercation with local Muslims. What added insult to injury was the inaction, or, as the Human Rights Watch report on the bloodbath put it, the refusal of the state machinery to protect Muslim citizens.More recently, the disenchantment caused by these earlier events has been reinforced by the lynching of several Muslims in northern and central India on the pretext that they were taking cows for slaughter or eating beef. The lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri, in western Uttar Pradesh, in 2015 on suspicion that he had stored beef in his house was the most chilling example of such incidents. It was followed by additional acts of mob violence carried out with relative impunity by the so-called gau rakshak (cow protector) vigilantes. Such incidents have led to a widespread feeling among Indian Muslims that the state, instead of providing security to them, now colludes with those determined to intimidate them into submission. This series of actions and reactions makes it evident that the growth of Hindu nationalism has acted as a major stimulus for the radicalisation of a section of Muslim society in India and that the two phenomena feed off each other.Onus on governing elitesOpinion leaders and religious scholars from within the Muslim community have the primary duty to confront and defeat the malign Wahhabi-Salafi influence on Indian Muslims in order to preserve the liberal and syncretic nature of Indian Islam thus pre-empting the spread of extremist ideology among Muslim youth. However, the impact of the growth of Hindu nationalism on the Muslim psyche can be countered only by the policies and actions of the governing elites at the Centre and in the States. Only they can take concrete steps, such as quick and impartial action against those responsible for creating mayhem in the name of religion, to reassure Muslims that the state will not shirk its responsibility of providing them physical security and ensuring that they are treated with fairness and dignity. This will be the best antidote to the percolation of radical ideas among Muslim youth by removing their sense of alienation from the Indian state that in the long run can threaten the country’s security.Mohammed Ayoob is University Distinguished Professor Emeritus of International Relations, Michigan State University and Non-Resident Senior Fellow, Center for Global Policy, Washington DC"

Anuvab Pal lights up proceedings, finding comedy in diversity
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"In order to find out what we want to know, perhaps the first question to ask is who we really are. Wrapping up the day’s events at The Huddle, in a show titled “Does the Nation Want to Know?,” comedian and writer Anuvab Pal first gathered the giggles by exploring the intricacies of how each region in the country behaves.“I am Bengali and we are not the bravest people in the country,” he began. “If someone threatened to elope with my wife, I’d have to go and scare him with a poem.”Runs riotMr. Pal ran riot through each State and the idiosyncrasies of the people there, although the fact that people in south India seem to understand and speak English well seemed to impress him immensely. (“When Lord Wellesley came to south India and yelled, ‘surrender,’ everyone applauded. At last, someone who speaks English! And while we are in the region, here’s another one, “Vasco da Gama went to Kerala, got an Ayurvedic massage and never left.” One last: “I performed in Kashmir last week. Everyone there is so good looking. No wonder they want to separate.”)Mr. Pal also held up a mirror to the state of journalism in India, especially in the form it plays out at prime time on television screens, where shouting anchors and tired talking heads play out a charade of a debate night after night, with not much real accomplishment other than constantly stirring the communal pot. He traced part of this, comically, to the origin of the construct of the term ‘Lutyens media’, which is often deployed to indicate a cabal of journalists and politicians who hobnob and trade favours in central Delhi, and the obsession with the actual residents of Lutyens Delhi in claiming London as their own and sounding ‘propahly’ English.The central point of Mr. Pal’s comedy is an honest look at ourselves, a diverse people now struggling with the issue of national identity, and baffled at how we got here in the first place. Class and linguistic constructs used to be structured. Now, who knows what’s going on?‘Does the Nation Want to Know?’ the show asks. In its inability to answer that lies the real question. Does the Nation Know?"

Old Rajender Nagar, in the Central part of Delhi, is a riot of food choices, keeping in mind the young population that thrives on books and hope
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"There are some signs that tell you what’s in store for you. 1) If there are dark clouds, there will be rain. 2) If there are ants, there will be sugar around. 3) If there are groups of students, there will be good food. While 1) and 2) may or may not be true all the time, 3) is a fact.The best example of this is Delhi University, an area which is now bursting at the seams with restaurants. You get all kinds of food there, from Naga and Assamese to Tibetan and Korean to American and Italian. Even Jawaharlal Nehru University is surrounded by several big and small eateries. And if you are in Old Rajender Nagar, you will find a whole new township of students — and a spate of restaurants.I was there last week — with an old friend, Raj — and thought I should try out one of the eateries that I had been hearing about. A part of Old Rajender Nagar is a hub of students — young men and women seeking to sit for the civil-service examinations. There are coaching centres all around, and students from across the country have taken rooms here. Eateries that serve regional food have sprung up in a market square next to the residential area, which is also the main market area.Old Rajender Nagar is on the right of Shankar Road if you are coming in from Connaught Place. I went there some months ago and had good Maharashtrian food at a place called Marathi Katta. This time, I wanted to try out an eatery called The Canteen. But it turned out that it had downed its shutters, so we went looking for other eateries, and came across Sri Annapurna, which serves Andhra cuisine.This is the place you should visit if you like your food hot. We saw the menu card and decided to get our lunch packed. I asked for a plate of tamarind rice (Rs. 90), two of upma (Rs. 60 a plate), one plate of chicken fry (Rs. 190) and another of chicken curry (Rs. 170 for half a plate). While the food was being readied, we shared a masala dosa (Rs. 80). The potato sabzi in the dosa was light but delicious, and the dosa itself was soft at the centre and crispy at the edges. Excellent.The young man at the counter urged us to wait for the chicken biryani, which had just been placed on the stove. But that was going to take another 30 or 40 minutes, so we reluctantly left without trying out the Andhra dum biryani (Rs. 150).We carried the lunch back home — and I must say I enjoyed the meal. The tamarind rice was nice and tart, and the chicken fry was hot and spicy. I enjoyed the thick gravy of the chicken curry, flavoured with onions and tamarind. I liked the upma, too, which was neither too oily, nor too dry. It had bits of peanuts in it, which added to the taste.I was right: Where there are students, you are bound to find food. Go try out Old Rajender Nagar. It’s young and vibrant, just like its residents."

Released a decade after it was made, The Fakir of Venice disappoints with the lack of alchemy between the lead actors
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Fakir of Venicefinally releases this week, 10 years after its premiere at the India Film Festival of Los Angeles in 2009. As one would have feared, it hasn’t quite aged well; the film looks and feels dated. Take for instance, the ancient models of mobiles in the hands of the various characters, the ungainly production design, or the bafflingly empty streets of Mumbai. Then there’s the presence of former veejay Kamal Siddhu who instantly reminded me of the other such stars of yore — Ruby Bhatia, Sophia Haque — names, a young audience today wouldn’t be familiar with. The film itself feels like a remnant of our early indie cinema, of a Kaizad Gustad or Dev Benegal.The underlying theme(s) of the film are perennial ones. Two men, at odds with each other, thrown together, even made to share a double bed in a hotel on foreign shores; their varying attitudes and approaches to life; the rich-poor class divide; the East-West collision; the gullibility of the West when it comes to all things spiritual. At the centre ofThe Fakir of Venice, is a con job. Adi (Farhan Akhtar) has to find a baba who can be ferried to Venice to be part of an installation by an eccentric artiste. When the attempts to coax the real sadhus come undone, he picks up a man off the streets — a labourer called Sattar (Annu Kapoor), who has buried himself in the sands of Juhu beach to make a quick buck.Both humour and poignancy are thrown in, in equal measure. There are jibes taken at religion and culture, and a few odd profound notes make a mark. Like a sadhu telling Adi that he doesn’t quite need to travel abroad when he can seebrahmand(universe) right where he is. But all of it feels half-hearted and half-baked, and doesn’t get communicated with any sense of urgency or conviction. Farhan Akhtar, in his debut as an actor, plays a cheeky, urbane hustler, a production coordinator who makes a success of all kinds of weird jobs, like transporting a monkey to a remote part of Himalayas. His motto is to, “never say no”. It’s a role that fits him well and vice versa. Yet one is left wishing there was a deeper exploration of the character’s inner restlessness. Annu Kapoor is not in form, melodramatic and morbid as Sattar, who has suffered in the riots and lost everything, including his wife. What more is left then to be taken away from him? Together the duo lack any vim and vitality, nor do they have the crucial alchemy to make the film work."

As a young kid with access to only to Western hip-hop, the now 28-year-old didn’t realise Hindi was a viable option. “I must have made 25 songs and released about ten, but the maximum [views] I got were about 10,000,” says Divine whose earnestness belies the swag he sports on stage. Today, the J.B Nagar Catholic boy’s YouTube channel has more than 8,00,000 subscribers. He’s released music with T-Series, Sony and Zee Music. He’s also provided music for films likeBlackmail,Mukkabaazand Netflix showSacred Games. Now, Divine has formed his own company Gully Gang Entertainment with his own record label. “I rapped in English but I thought in Hindi,” he gently chuckles. “My listeners were very different from the scene before but now the whole scene listens to us.”The scene in question is the circle of music fiends who happily devoured jacked-up drinks at Mumbai’s swish bars. They’re that elite person (read: flower child/ hipster) in search of a new cool fix. This not-quite-melting-pot was stirred after Divine’s 2013 hit‘Yeh Mera Bombay’. Then, a year later came Naezy’s ‘Aafat!’. “We started relating to everyone, whether it’s a businessman, rickshaw driver, hawker or actor,” says Divine. “That’s the beauty of Mumbai, a local guy and actor will both have to drive on same road.” It’s also why there’s been a proliferation of multi-language hip-hop artistes, more than any other music genre. The barrier for entry into hip-hop is lower according to rapper A-List aka Ashwini Mishra who’s been a pioneer of Indian hip-hop. “You didn’t need to move in certain circles or get entry to fancy clubs,” says A-List. “The circle of rappers was fairly mixed in class and caste. It’s not the same rich middle-class kids that form part of the [music] scene.”Surf and turfLong before Ranveer Singh was jumping off stages injuring unsuspecting spectators to promoteGully Boy, hip-hop in India had virtual beginnings. Although, MTV introduced the genre to a nation of starved music lovers in the 90s, there were few artistes like Baba Sehgal, Style Bhai and Blaaze who experimented with desi hop-hop. Legit MCs (master of ceremonies or mic controllers) from around the country were battling on Orkut in a group called Insignia (also called Pathshala). The Pathshala, featured Rap Combats (subgroups) on texts, audio and even had a database of contacts. Today’s underground MCs are mostly those Insignia alumni taking hip-hop forward. “They’d write a verse and it was just reading and then they had audio battles, people dissing each other with lyrics,” says 26-year-old Ankur Johar aka Enkore who was active on Insignia along with Divine. “Simultaneously, clubs in the city were having hip-hop nights but there were hardly any MCs.” Artistes like Big Silly, Raja Mukherjee, Vineet Nair (Poetik Justice), Lester Cardoz (Kav-E), DJ Ishani, DJ BobKat are veterans. “Unfortunately [they] ended up in high-brow places and a lot of the artistes ended up having to look more elite,” says Enkore who’s recently released his second albumBombay Soul.But it was evident that hip-hop had sunk its claws into willing music lovers. Even 50 Cent at the height of his career performed in Mumbai in November 2007. It was during a time only washed-up international musicians passed through the country in a bid to stay relevant. Some time later “Bombay Bassment took the indie scene by storm as India’s first ever hip-hop band,” remembers Ishani Majumdar, one of the first DJs (as DJ Ishani) to host hip-hop nights in the city.After the noughties, freestyle rap cyphers started mushrooming in a spots like Dadar’s Narali Baug, Sion Fort, hookah parlours and random joints all over the city. Upscale clubs like Royalty too were playing hip-hop in Bandra, although these places were less accessible to most. “We met on a weekly basis and the idea was to create a space where it wasn’t about performances but working on the craft,” says A-List who used to host Cypher Mania for freestyle rapping. “The problem with hip-hop in Mumbai is you didn’t know whether you sucked or not. Even if you were the worst, you still rapped and that community was very crucial,” he adds. Soon dedicated freestyle rap (cypher) nights were established. For instance, event company Culture Shoq’s open mic nights were initially aimed at comedy and poetry. “But then us rappers started filling up all the spots,” laughs Enkore.Gone with the filmWithGully Boyhip-hop is front and centre in a Bollywood film, but it’s not the first time the two have intersected. Yo Yo Honey Singh, Bohemia, Raftaar, Badshah have been the conveyor belt to fuel Hindi films’ obsession with club hits. As Zoya Akhtar steers away from her brand of cinema (a la riches to rags), Bollywood awakens to a different kind of hip-hop. “From a music point of view, Bollywood is validating our music, they are recognising our music,” says Naezy aka Naved Sheikh who along with Divine are the inspiration for the upcoming film. “Now the masses too will also listen to our music.”A hip-hop veteran like A-List too considers the merging favourable saying it offers a lot of financial opportunities to rappers. “Hip-hop is not a monolith. Authenticity, doesn’t have to mean one kind of Indian hip-hop,” he says. “If you rap, you’re a real rapper.” Though, Divine appreciatesGully Boy, he understands that the film industry has latched onto something ‘cool’. “I don’t have that much faith in Bollywood. It’s great that hip-hop is in the mainstream, but we shouldn’t depend on it,” he says. “The Internet made guys like me and I think making good music should be the goal, not Bollywood.”Others are more sceptical. Soon after videos ofGully Boy’s launch were out, Enkore took to social media to voice his displeasure. He rapped, “Bollywood scripts ne palte poore biopics aur culture ko diyaRock On/Samjho yeh strategy, entertainment yeh, na koi documentary/Aur scripted hip-hop kabhi asli nahi. He explains his stance, “I don’t think Bollywood is damaging hip-hop but it’s diluting it. It is the voice of the streets and it’s that voice for us.”It’s a sentiment that has resonated with every artiste interviewed for this feature. Hip-hop is the voice of the people and it’s here to stay. Most artistes have been hustling to pursue their passion and they don’t plan to stop any time soon. “The indie music scene in general is going through a rough patch right now, limited performance spaces and dwindling crowds,” says Ishani. “Indie hip-hop artistes will adjust to the new dynamics and continue to be a force in this Bollywood-addicted city.”Make some NaezyIt was some time after the 1992 riots in the city when Kurla was under close scrutiny by the police. “Many people were killed in encounters and it had become hard to get your hands on guns,” remembers Naved Sheikh aka Naezy (a portmanteau of Naved and Noisy) who easily embodies the cool grace he sports in performances. Dressed simply in sweats and T-shirt, he’s bemoaning a mouth ulcer. But it does nothing to stop the gush of conversation. “People use knives now,” he says seriously. The 26-year-old rapper is talking about his childhood where he lived with ten people in a 10x10 house. The “chota criminal” as he calls himself, distinctly remembers how at 14, he heard Sean Paul’s ‘Temperature’ at a neighbourhood function. Hip-hop soon became an escape not just from what was happening outside but also inside for Naezy. With little access to TV and the Internet, Naezy would go to cyber cafés and print out lyrics of songs. He’d meticulously pour over them learning to spit rhymes. After the 2014 viral hit ‘Aafat’, the rapper brought Indian hip-hop to the fore. His latest song,‘Asal Hustle’(which released two years ago) has 12,51,950 views. “I don’t like the term gully rap, it’s what people have started calling it,” he laughs. “I’d prefer Bombay hip-hop. If we come from Bombay we need to represent our life and our genre, we are more than just gullies.”Naezy’s famously declared he couldn’t possibly rap about ‘bottles of vodka’, because he couldn’t afford one, let alone four. Instead, he prefers to talk about his life, even if it’s about the less-than-rosy things Mumbai has to offer. “Even if I have money, I won’t talk about it. There are two kinds of rappers in the industry, those who talk about the truth and others who just show off. But I think there’s space for everyone. I want to talk about socio-political issues.” In a soon-to-be-released song, the rapper dissects the relationship between a roadside thug and a police ‘mama’. “I will ask them tumhara duty kya hai, sirf paisa leta hai kya?As a child, Naezy impressed the kids in his hood with export quality clothes he’d scoured Colaba and Fashion Street for. Today, he only wears Adidas. “The brands that I used to buy copies of want to style me exclusively,” he smiles with a touch of pride. Things have certainly changed, but Naezy can’t forget his roots. His family still wants him to study further (he’s got a Bachelor’s in Science). Even a Bollywood life inspired by his life won’t impress his family. “Gully Boyis just another project to them,” he says. “But hip-hop is my life.”"

The two other accused, Afzal and Iqbal, were later summoned when evidence of their complicity in the killings emerged during the course of the trial."

Party backs police action against activist and academician Anand Teltumbde
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Shiv Sena on Wednesday backed police action against activist and academician Anand Teltumbde, and sought to draw a parallel between those linked to the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune and the Al-Qaeda terror outfit.The party said that constant attacks on the police, administration and law, raising doubts over the State government and demoralising people was the strategy adopted by the Al-Qaeda. “People supporting Elgar Parishad also have a similar strategy,” the Sena said in an editorial published in its mouthpieceSaamana.“Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar dubbed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) a terrorist body, but it is a radical nationalist organisation,” the Sena said. Mr. Teltumbde, who the police claim has Maoist links, is an accused in the Bhima-Koregaon case registered by the Pune police. The case was filed following violent clashes at Bhima-Koregaon village near Pune district on January 1, 2018. The activist was arrested last week in the case and released following a sessions court order. He was booked following the Elgar Parishad on December 31, 2017, which, the police alleged, triggered clashes the next day at Bhima-Koregaon.According to the police, the event was funded and supported by the Maoists. The Sena said, “The Bhima-Koregaon riots, where Dalits were attacked, has caused a vertical split in society. Sowing the seeds of rebellion, creating and spreading such literature and raising funds for it is the actual work of Maoist intellectuals. Al-Qaeda and intellectuals linked to the Elgar Parishad have a similar style of functioning.”‘Anti-national activities’The editorial said people facing criminal charges such as murder, corruption and massacre get acquitted at times, which does not necessarily mean they are innocent, and Mr. Teltumbde’s supporters should know this. The Sena claimed some serious “anti-national activities” were being planned, and portraying police as criminals was the beginning of such a conspiracy. “Hence, this is the right time to stand firmly with police,” it said.It also objected to the term ‘Dalit academic’ used to refer to Mr. Teltumbde, saying it was an insult to tag caste with a person’s intelligence. “People having a soft corner towards the Naxal movement cooked up the plan to spew venom of casteism in Maharashtra,” the editorial said.It added that “bogus intellectuals” reacted to the action against Mr. Teltumbde and other intellectuals like Varavara Rao, Arun Perreira, Vernon Gonsalves and Sudha Bhardwaj as if the “sky was falling“.The court offered them, including Mr. Teltumbde, some respite, but does it mean police should not do anything, wondered the Sena. “The police have presented proof of their [activists] speeches and venom-spewing literature. All these people were key persons to destabilise the country,” the Sena alleged.Their high academic qualifications have offered them prestige and contacts in the fields of administration, law and judiciary and education sectors, it said. “These people have used such a network to spread the destructive thoughts of Naxalites and Maoism,” it said.In a way, these people are “sponsors or preachers of terrorism”, the party said, adding that intellectuals also need to abide by law."

Asokan had been on a stake-out at the Central Railway Station, Thampanoor, since Saturday after they received information that the accused would try to board a train to north Kerala. Undercover officers arrested Praveen when he entered the station.The police had incriminated the RSS pracharak in the case after surveillance camera footage of him hurling four country bombs in close succession at the station house surfaced as a smoking gun in the media.The incident had occurred on January 2 when Kerala was caught in a vortex of violence a day after two women, Binu Ammini and Kanakadurga, worshipped at Sabarimala temple, upending a ban on women between the age of 10 and 50 years from entering the temple.Long stand-offThe Supreme Court had declared the practice illegal and trespass against the Constitutional principle of gender equality on September 28, 2018. The verdict had precipitated a stand-off between the government and Hindu right-wing outfits determined to stop the State from upholding the judgment.The country bomb attack on the police station was the highlight of the Sabarimala Karma Samathi (SKS)-initiated hartal that resulted in destruction of public property and attacks on law enforcers, journalists, party houses of political functionaries across Kerala.The violence had resulted in the registration of 1,369 cases and the arrest and incarceration of over 900 persons, an overwhelming number of them SKS, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and RSS workers on charges of damaging public property, attack on officers, arson, unlawful assembly, and rioting.Officers said Praveen, a resident of Nooranad in Kollam district, was politically active in Nedumangad for several years. He was an accused in several cases of causing hurt, including one of attempted murder. The court had earlier rejected his plea for anticipatory bail.Petition in High CourtThe police had raided the houses of his relatives in Kollam, triggering accusations of harassment and at least one petition in the High Court. They had issued a wanted person notice against Praveen and arrested at least five persons, including his brother, on the charge of having harboured a fugitive from the law.The police said they would produce Praveen before a magistrate and seek his return to police custody for further questioning.Praveen is an accused in several cases of causing hurtPolice had issued wanted person notice, arrested his brother"

The verdict then led to a stand-off between the Government and Hindu right-wing outfits determined to stop the State from upholding the judgement.The country bomb attack on the police station was the highlight of the Sabarimala Karma Samathi (SKS) initiated hartal that resulted in destruction of public property and attacks on law enforcers, journalists, party houses of political functionaries across Kerala.The violence had resulted in the registration of 1,369 cases and the arrest and incarceration of over 900 persons, an overwhelming number of them SKS, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and RSS workers on charges of damaging public property, attacks on officers, arson, unlawful assembly and rioting.Officers said Praveen, a resident of Nooranad, was politically active in Nedumangad for several years. He was accused in many cases of causing hurt, including a charge of attempted murder. The court had earlier rejected his plea for anticipatory bail.The police had raided the houses of his relatives in Kollam, triggering accusations of harassment and at least one petition in the High Court. They had issued a wanted person notice against Praveen and arrested at least five persons, including his brother, on the charge of having harboured a fugitive from the law.The police said they would produce Praveen before a magistrate and seek his return to police custody for further questioning."

A documentary resurrects the 1960 tour by Assam’s Bhupen Hazarika and Bengal’s Hemango Biswas at the peak of the Assamese-Bengali conflict
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With cracks resurfacing in the relationship between the Assamese and the Bengalis due to the updation of the National Register of Citizens in Assam, a documentary intends to serve as a reminder of how music brought peace to Assam during the language riots of 1960.The documentary has been made by Rongili Biswas, daughter of legendary Bengali singer Hemango Biswas. As a precursor to the film, she has released online a music album, titled ‘Hemango-Bhupen: A Song for Everyone — Tales of the 1960 peace initiative against the linguistic riots in Assam’.The tracks play in the background while stills — many of them rare photographs — tell the story of the 1960 riots, which broke out after Assamese was made the State language. This triggered large-scale violence and arson across Assam, home to many Bengalis.It was then that Bengal’s Hemango Biswas and Assam’s Bhupen Hazarika (singer-lyricist recently honoured with Bharat Ratna) travelled with a peace caravan to pacify the mobs.The duo travelled with a 30-member caravan across undivided Assam. “The artists came from all walks of life, representing a very rich folk tradition of various communities of Assam. Predominantly, they were from the Assam chapter of the leftist cultural movement IPTA (Indian People’s Theatre Association), which completed its 75th year in 2018,” said Ms. Biswas, an academic and musician in her own right.Ms. Biswas made the documentary, ‘A Song for Everyone’, with a grant from the Benguluru-based India Foundation for the Arts. The title has been borrowed from a poem on the mission, composed by the Bengal poet Shankha Ghosh. “But I need to re-edit the film,” Ms. Biswas said.Many hurdlesIn the film, Ms. Biswas has interviewed many of the dancers, singers and musicians — now mostly in their late eighties — associated with the 1960 caravan. They narrate how the caravan slowly evolved, overcoming obstacles.“It was not an easy situation,” recalls Uma Dutta, a danseuse with the troupe, in the film. “A local person told us before our performance in Goreswar (in northwest Assam), one of the worst-hit areas: “You Bengalis (there was another Bengali dancer, Sandhya Das) have come to perform here. Don’t you know how Bengali women were tortured here a few days back?’”Hemango Biswas noted in a small piece, ‘Let Us Meet – A report on 1960 Peace Mission’, that at almost every step of organising the event, for which he summoned Bhupen Hazarika from Kolkata, the team had to negotiate hurdles: “…both the communities tried to dissuade us. Some even made fun of us.” But the show – which had artists from Khasi, Jayantia, Nepali, Assamese and Bengali communities – was a resounding success.Shillong Observerhad noted, “Out of the gloom of riot-torn life we emerge as brothers, each with distinctive culture and language orchestrated into a magnificent harmony united in creative labour for a prosperous future.”The high point of the performance was a song, specially produced for the occasion by Hazarika and Biswas,Haradhan-Rongmon Katha, a conversational ballad that narrated the story of two farmers Haradhan and Rongmon, one Bengali and another Assamese, who had come together to survive in the backdrop of a fratricidal riot.“Just as Bhupen’s sensitive and mellifluous voice resonated with the sorrows of Haradhan, perhaps the meandering strains of Bhatiali in my voice too echoed Rongmon’s grief. The audience was overwhelmed,” noted Biswas.Strikes a chord“I remember after the programme in Nagaon, one of worst riot-hit areas, as Hemangoda and Bhupenda came down from the stage, with arms around each other, many people started crying,” recalls Ruby Hazarika, a team member. “The Gopinath Bordoloi Hall was chock-a-block and the song had a huge emotional impact,” remembers Gyanada Bora, who attended the performance as a school student.Bhupen Hazarika, who joined the BJP much later in 2004, joined IPTA after his return from the U.S. around 1952 and was “one of the most active and creative members of IPTA”, noted Hemango Biswas.Their friendship consolidated as they jointly organised the third Assam conference of IPTA in 1955, when the likes of Balraj Sahni, Salil Chowdhury and Hemanta Mukherjee participated, among others.So in 1960, “Bhupen arrived as soon as he received the telegram” to initiate his battle against fratricide. No wonder, his U.S.-based son Tez Hazarika’s initial comments on hearing that Bharat Ratna was conferred on his father echoed the sentiment: “Awarding Bhupen Hazarika with the Bharat Ratna is a win for humanity, diversity and India as a secular democracy.”The caravan — with the 30 performers in three cars and a jeep — moved from one district to another as the audiences started swelling. Not only the locals (some of whom were engaged in the conflict) joined, but many requested a performance in their localities.“[In] rural areas, especially school students…blocked our path and force us to perform. Such a programme was held in Bokakhat [where girl students] were busy cooking for us,” wrote Biswas in the article on the peace mission. Many even confessed to their mistake.“After the [Nagaon] programme, three students came up to me and confessed with much remorse that they had participated in the riots. One of them was a lead worker of the student federation,” he wrote.In Tezpur and later in Mongoldoi, Assam IPTA’s president and cultural icon Bishnu Prasad Rabha “demonstrated how the [British] colonial rule created a division and rift between different ethnic and linguistic groups” and the post-independence Congress government continued the “legacy forward.”Interestingly, it was the Congress government which arranged for the peace tour after the caravan’s maiden performance in Shillong, realising that the Assamese-Bengali conflict was spiralling out of control.“Bhupen and I got an invitation from the Chief Minister [Bimala Prasad Chaliha] and administrative responsibilities were delegated to Home Minister Fakhruddin Ali Saheb (later President of India),” noted Biswas.Hazarika noted in an essay that the Chief Minister confessed that he had “lost the battle” against linguistic nationalists. “You do whatever you can. Killings are rising with each passing day,” Chaliha told Hazarika. Then Home Minister Ahmed promised “everything” to make the peace caravan a success.“After so much of travelling we, the members of the Let Us Meet cultural troupe — who hardly used to know each other in the beginning – became one unit, a family,” Hazarika says in the film.Ms. Biswas plans to bring out, by next summer, a book containing short memoirs of Hazarika and Biswas, their letters, the songs and poems performed on the tour and small essays by them on each other. “Perhaps this is the most fitting time to revisit their works as the situation is appearing to be more complex than ever in Assam,” she said.At Nagaon, one of worst riot-hit areas, as Hemangoda and Bhupenda came down the stage, with arms around each other, many people started cryingRuby HazarikaMember of the 1960 caravan"

He has no option but to repeat whatever they [Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah] want him to say. I do not know whether I should say this and perhaps it is not … they are also framing Rajnath’s son. They have filed FIR against him [Rajnath’s son]. Whatever they [Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah] want you to say... [you] have to say, that is the policy,” Ms. Banerjee asserted.On corruption, she countered that it would be Mr. Modi who would face probes over issues like demonetisation and the Jan Dhan scheme, once he was out of power. “The truth will be out,” she said, adding that in order to cover up “corrupt activities”, Mr. Modi was engaging in syndicates of his own.“These are syndicates of lynchings, cow vigilantes, syndicates of [investigative] agencies and syndicates of riots. However we will not allow them to orchestrate riots in Bengal and make Bengalis fight the Bengalis, or divide Hindus and Muslims,” she asserted.We will not let them disturb Assam and the northeastern region or let them push Biharis or people from Uttar Pradesh out of the State [of Gujarat]…India will not get divided, rather he [Mr. Modi] will go,” she said.“They ask about Saradha and Narada scams, which will not be proved; I would like to ask why chit funds were not investigated between 1980 and 2011,” she said. Referring to Mr. Modi’s jibe that the Opposition was scared of his anti-corruption stand and therefore uniting against him, Ms. Banerjee contended that on the contrary the “BJP is scared” and bringing leaders from across the country to fight her in West Bengal."

On the journey to fame

Charles Dickens was considered one of the greatest writers of his time. Through his writing brought into the open, the suffering and oppression of the poor and downtrodden.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"We are all familiar with the story of the Christmas ghost that comes visiting an elderly miser and shows him snippets of a life lived selfishly, causing him to change his lifestyle.This is a story by Charles Dickens. Born on February 8, 1812, he was an English writer, and created some of the best known fictional characters of his time. He was the second of eight children, and of his early life he says, “Very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy”. He spent a lot of time outdoors and was a voracious reader too. But, his sunny days came to a sudden end when his father was thrown into prison.Charles had to be lodged with a family friend, whom he later immortalised in his bookDombey and Son, as Mrs. Pipchin. Later, he went to live in the back attic of an agent for the Insolvent Court, whom he wrote about inThe Old Curiosity Shop.He had to leave school, so that he could pay for his board and help his family. He worked 10 hours a day for which he earned six shillings a week. His job? Pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. A few months later, his grandmother passed away and she bequeathed a sum of money to his father that enabled him to pay his debts and be released from prison. The family left for Marshalsea in Southwark, London. However, to Charles’ great dismay, his mother never asked for him to be released from his job. He was sufficiently hurt, “I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back”.Back to schoolHe went back to school, after which he worked as a junior clerk at a law office. He later worked as a freelance reporter. By 20, though he lacked focus on what he wanted to become, he knew he wanted fame.In 1833, he submitted his first story “A Dinner at Poplar Walk” to the London periodicalMonthly Magazine. Two years later, he began a series onStreet Sketchesfor theMorning Chronicle.The Sketches by Bozbecame popular, and he received a proposal from publishers to supply text to match the illustrations for a monthly letterpress. The resulting story becamePickwick Papers, and in its final instalment sold 40,000 copies.Over time, his success as a novelist grew. It is said the young Queen Victoria readOliver TwistandPickwick Papers,and was enthralled by them.Nicholas Nickleby(1838–39),The Old Curiosity Shop(1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel,Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty, as part of theMaster Humphrey's Clockseries (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.On June 8, 1870, Dickens suffered a stroke from which he never recovered. He has stated that he wished to be buried at Rochester Cathedral “in an inexpensive, ostentatious and, strictly private manner”, but instead was laid to rest in the Poet’s Corner of Westminster Abbey."

Reverence, relevance, restoration

A century-old residence gets a makeover, yet retains its glory at the hands of architect Husna Rahamanwho deftly plays with hues and patterns. By Nandhini Sundar
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When an architect is faced with a century-old residence or even one that is half the age, his/her immediate reaction is to demolish and develop the site or build a fabulous contemporary dwelling, money and space permitting.Today, restoring such a building to its former glory is beyond the radar, especially given the economics behind such an initiative. The state of the structure and the lifestyle the interior facilities offer, further promote this inclination.But when architect Husna Rahaman of Fulcrum Studio was given the century-old sprawling 7,000 sq. ft colonial home for restoration — the structure essentially a no-nonsense load-bearing piece of engineering that cannot be tampered with on whim — she realised that strategic alterations, if any, could happen only where necessary.The entire restoration thus occurred on a delicate balance of reverence and relevance, the regal aura retained while the modern functional quotient was brought in where relevant.Playing with patternsIn tune with the era it related to, the residence came with its accompanying hues and patterns that literally saturated the spaces, the patterned antique floor and wall tiles engulfing the ambience.And so, without shunning this past grandeur, Rahaman set about managing deftly the play of hues and patterns where they would enchant and refresh, without submerging the senses. “It was literally a riot of colours and this base was used as a spring board to complement the residence where it is not eliminated but used to balance,” she explains.Keeping this intent in perspective, an elegant network of wood verticals and horizontals were brought in to frame the length and breadth of the expansive living area.A new set of chandeliers were added, yet the design of these were kept deliberately colonial in keeping with the structure’s flavour.The rich flooring was retained, along with the porcelain tile dadoing on the walls, both in the living area as well as rest of the residence.A refreshing contemporary twist was brought into the home by introducing metal motifs on the walls, the motifs reflecting the existing patterns. While the walls and the ceiling continue to accommodate the wooden columns and beams, a colourful reminder of the colonial past, the architect ensures a contemporary flavour wafts into the sturucture through concealed lights and varied metal motifs.Contemporary upgradeThe living area reveals the presence of two groups of furniture, each connected by a large back-to-back sofa cluster. The unusual blend of materials and styles seen in the living area and carried methodically into the rest of the residence, where luxury is paired with minimalism and exquisite Indian crafts tie in seamlessly with streamlined forms, reveals a reverential contemporary upgrade of a glorious past.While the strong imperial character of the structure has been reverentially retained, the spaces have been infused with warmth to address the home it ultimately is. This has been successfully achieved through application of soft roses on the walls, neutral colours with subtle pops of colour in the rugs, strips of wallpaper and cushions in shades of pink and orange.Likewise, the spatial poetry of the house, an element lacking in modern crowded structures, has been preserved to integrate the multiple rooms.Infusing metalGiven the era of the residence, metal does not figure in its construction. Yet, metal has been craftily infiused nto the stately space, lightening the palette.The floral medallion in the living area serves as a symbolic confluence of the metallic motifs used in the rest of the residence. Metal also features as an artistic railing for the staircase, replacing the previous cement and brick staircase. The terrace further reveals a stunning dark grey metal gazebo to unwind and relax, besides serving as an entertainment zone when need arises.Sun roomThe first level of the building came with narrow spaces, yet the interiors were filled with abundant natural light. Rahaman decided to capture this effectively to create a sunny library. “The room came with its quota of colours and patterns like the rest of the house and the space was converted into a turquoise library with a western exposure by merely introducing rugs into the space,” she says.The ‘sun room’ reveals rugs in intense hues of ochre and turquoise blue, soaked in geometric patterns where they define the floor, with the turquoise blue and wood verticals on the walls complementing the same. Vibrant in conception, the space greets with a burst of exuberance, the twin daybeds created between the columns further enhancing with their presence.The contemporary flavour wafts into the spaces through concealed lights and metal motifs"

The rivers Thames and Vrushabhavati, the mishaps, museums and more common things between Bangalore and London
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"River Thames has played a major role in shaping the commerce, trade, culture and lifestyle of London. But, the resultant growth of the city itself has become a bane to the river as the effluents and sewage found its way into the water, converting it into an unhealthy, stinking cesspool. By the year 1236, Thames was so contaminated that it was useless and unhygienic. During the subsequent centuries, the administrators took rapid measures to clean the river and by 1450 they could establish domestic water supply from the river.In 1858, the failing drainage turned River Thames into a deadly stinking sewer. It was infamously referred to as the ‘Great Stink”. The Punch Magazine in its issue of July 10, 1858, published a cartoon with the titleThe Silent Highway Man,depicting the horrible plight of Thames flowing near St. Paul Church. A human skeleton, shrouded in black cloth was rowing a small boat with dead rats and some other creatures. Again, London rulers rose to the occasion and with their herculean efforts brought life back to the river. By 1950, yet again, rapid growth of the city turned Thames into dirty water flow. Foreseeing the impending disaster, London Authorities launched a huge project with very strict measures in 1954, to prevent the flow of the industrial effluents, sewerage and all other rubbish into the river. It took almost a decade to complete the processes. Today, Thames is a major tourist attraction of Europe. It’s a pleasant experience to have a boat ride on the river sailing under all the bridges. A blue plaque indicates that over 100 types of fishes live in Thames.In Bangalore, just one century back there was a smaller version of Thames called Vrushbhavati. An inscription at the base of the left foot of the bull at Bull Temple suggests the origin of an underground stream at that point. The water used to get collected in a big depression forming a pond, then known as Basavannana Kere. Later, it went downstream towards Hosakere Halli, and continued as a visible rivulet, taking a turn near Gali Anjaneya Temple, went further parallel to Mysore Road to join River Arkavati. Many nonagenarians recall how crystal clear the rivulet was and it was utilized to cultivate crops and vegetables. But, the formation of new extensions like Basavanagudi, Chamarajapet, resulted in the flow of sewerage joining the river. The uncontrolled flow of industrial effluents worsened the situation. Though sewerage treatment plants were set up, the uncontrolled growth of the city, and the resultant inflow of huge quantity of dirty water have become insufficient in solving the problem. Like the ‘Great Stink’ of London, Vrushabhavati also came to be known as ‘Kengeri Mori’(gutter). However, since last few years, some NGOs are grouping together to sensitize the industrialists and the concerned authorities to control the inflow of sewer and effluents into the river. In fact, there are a few local talents who say that it is possible to convert the flow into little ‘Thames of Bangalore’ and even generate some quantity of electricity to illuminate the garden that could be laid on the banks near Mysore Road. What is required is strict implementation of law by the authorities and realisation by the general public about the urgent need of restoring the river.London is a city of disasters and misfortunes. Since the beginning, the city has been ravaged by riots, loots, attacks, smog, famine, plague, cholera, Black death, world wars, fire and floods. The fiercest enemies of London are fire and water. Since the beginning of London’s history there have been more than a dozen major fire breakouts, burning different parts of the city. But, a little spark originated in a small bakery, on September 2, 1666 engulfed the City of London and is considered as one of the 10 Great Fires of the world. Similarly, the floods of Thames had almost drowned the city in1928 and 1947. In spite of all these disasters, every time London has risen like a Phoenix from the ashes. In Bangalore, there have been sieges by Marathas and Mughals. The third Anglo Mysore war in March 1791 is a major attack on Bangalore. Yet, compared to London the damage to life and property was less.Few major fire mishaps in our city were at the Venus Circus, Carlton Towers, K. R. market (caused by crackers). In spite of these tragedies, we do hear about fire safety norms not being followed in many public places. Rains have caused havocs in low lying areas of the city. But it is more due to callous attitude of the concerned authorities than due to rain itself.London is a city of museums. There have been several such centers depicting various facets of the city’s history. London Museum gives a clear picture of 2000 years history of London. The huge exhibition centre has been built on the location which was ravaged by bombs during the second world war.Bangalore too has more than 12 museums including the attractive Government Museum at Kasturba Road. There is an exclusive Kempegowda Museum at MG road to showcase our city’s history. Yet, there is an immediate need to build Bangalore Museum on the lines of London Museum in a bigger and better location.London is one of the few major tourist destinations of the world. The tourist friendly city promotes itself through souvenirs and mementos done on all the icons of London. The colorful pictorial time line of London History is available in almost all places of the city at a reasonable prize.In Bangalore, attempts have been made both at MG Road and Kempegowda Bus Station to give the time line of Bangalore history. Some enthusiasts are making souvenirs with the pictures of some monuments of the city.The sole purpose of London-Bangalore comparative study series written in this column is not to make Bangalore an another London but to make our city a Better Bangalore.London-Bangalore series concluded.sureshmoona@gmail.com"

Sevilla hammering shows Barcelona want to win all three titles, says Lionel Messi ",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/sevilla-hammering-shows-barcelona-want-to-win-all-three-titles-says-lionel-messi/article26138402.ece,"
Barcelona are into the last four for the ninth consecutive year and edge closer to an historic fifth Copa del Rey title in a row.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Lionel Messi believes Barcelona showed their appetite for the Copa del Rey by blowing away Sevilla 6-1 on Thursday to pull off a brilliant comeback and book their place in the semifinals.Sevilla had won the first leg 2-0 but their lead was wiped out within 31 minutes at the Camp Nou, after Philippe Coutinho scored a penalty, deferred to him by Messi, before Ivan Rakitic poked in a second.Ever Banega had squandered the chance to level for Sevilla by missing his own spot-kick and Barca ran riot in the second half.Coutinho headed in his second and Sergi Roberto added a fourth, only for Guilherme Arana to give Sevilla brief hope. Luis Suarez and Messi wrapped up an emphatic victory late on, the latter after a superb counter-attacking move.Some had suggested Barcelona would be relieved to exit the Copa del Rey to focus fully on La Liga and the Champions League but Messi said their display had silenced the doubters.“It was said that we had given up in the cup, that we didn't want it,” Messi said afterwards. “But in no way is this the case. This team wants to fight for all three titles, as is the obligation of Barca every year.”Coutinho's form has wavered in recent weeks but his double could do wonders for confidence.Barcelona, meanwhile, are no strangers to these sort of revivals but against Sevilla, who sit fourth in La Liga and have been one of their closest challengers this season, it was particularly impressive.The defending champions are into the last four for the ninth consecutive year and edge closer to an historic fifth Copa del Rey title in a row.They join Valencia and Real Betis in the semis after Betis had earlier needed extra time to beat Espanyol 3-1, 4-2 on aggregate, while Valencia knocked out Getafe on Tuesday.Real Madrid could fill the last spot. They carry a 4-2 lead into their second leg against Girona on Thursday.Ernesto Valverde had rested players at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan but he fielded almost his strongest XI in the return.Messi, left out last week, was back in the starting line-up, along with Suarez, Jordi Alba and Coutinho. Jasper Cillessen kept his place in goal ahead of Marc-Andre ter Stegen.Messi gives up penalty dutiesPerhaps Messi felt Coutinho had played a big part in winning the penalty after it was the Brazilian's drag-back that gave him the ball.Messi went to shoot but struck the leg of Quincy Promes, who could do little about the contact. Referee Jose Sanchez checked with VAR and pointed to the spot. Messi gave way to Coutinho, who whipped it into the corner.The night could have been different had Cillessen not produced a pair of brilliant saves to preserve his team's lead. First, he tipped Andre Silva's flicked finish onto the post and then he saved Banega's penalty, pushing it out after Gerard Pique had brought down Roque Mesa.It could have been 1-1 but four minutes later, it was 2-0, Arthur Melo picking out Rakitic, whose attempt to control turned into a poke past the committed Juan Soriano. Rakitic held up his hands, choosing not to celebrate against his former club.Barca appeared to have put the tie beyond doubt when they scored twice in as many minutes in the second half. Coutinho stooped low to head in Suarez's cross and then Sergi Roberto hammered in after a delicate ball through from Messi.Instead, Sevilla pulled one back, Arana driving into the far corner. There were 23 minutes left and the visitors only needed one more to go through on away goals.But Suarez set Barca off again, tapping in Alba's cross before Messi added a final flourish. He started the move with a soaring pass left to Arturo Vidal, who fed inside to Suarez. Pique played the ball back to Suarez by flicking it with his right foot and then Alba teed up Messi, by flicking with his left. Messi made it six."

Cops to work on vehicle thefts, accidents this year ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Navi Mumbai police have achieved a 66% success rate in detecting crimes last year, of the 5,515 cases registered with them. In 2017, they had a success rate of 72%, of the 4,561 cases registered.In the current year, vehicle thefts and accidents are an area of concern and would be the priority, said Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar, addressing the media on Wednesday. Mr. Kumar said there was was no specific reason for the decrease in the rate of detection. “There are a number of cases which cannot be detected, and that contributes to the number of undetected cases.”Cases of attempt to murder have increased by 74%, rape by 17%, chain-snatching by 53%, other thefts by 51%, vehicle thefts by 44%, rioting by 70%, kidnapping by 47% and cheating by 27 %. At least 633 body offences were registered in 2017, of which 603 were detected while in 2018, 784 were registered of which 735 were detected. Nearly 1,802 property offences were registered in 2017, of which 845 were detected while 2,280 were registered in 2018 of which 974 were detected. At least 463 offences against women were registered in 2017, of which 455 were detected while in 2018, 546 were registered and 514 detected. Around 153 cases of rape were registered in which arrests were made in 151 cases. “Of the total rape cases, only three were done by unidentified persons. Around 47 were under the promise of marriage and in the rest of the cases, either a friend, neighbour or relative is involved,” Mr. Kumar said.In 2018, here were 22.03% convictions while in 2017, it was at 24.63%. “As compared to 2017, in 2018 around 772 more cases faced trial. The conviction rate has gone down by 2% due to factors like witnesses going hostile, unavailability of officers to stay present before court on the date due to other official commitments,” Mr. Kumar said. In 2018, 142 offences were registered under Protection of Children against Sexual Offence Act (POCSO) sections while in 2017, there were 120 cases. The conviction rate in 2017 was 18.96%, and it increased to 38% in 2018. “We will be reviewing the cases to see how the rate of conviction can be increased,” Mr Kumar said.The arrest of two accused helped Navi Mumbai police curb chain-snatching and POCSO cases. Around 50 chain-snatching cases were detected with the arrest of Fayyaz Khalid Shaikh (35) on October 19 and gold worth ₹57.69 lakh was recovered from him. Meanwhile, eight POCSO cases were detected with the arrest of Rehan Qureshi, who was also the accused in rape and murder cases in Nehru Nagar, Kurla.In cyber crime, around 75 cases were registered, of which 27 were detected. Phishing, debit card and credit card fraud constitute 15 cases and offences involving social media constitute 23 cases. “After working on five years’ data, we will find the hotspots in vehicle theft and accidents to curb them this year. Our aim is to have a decrease in fatal accidents by at least 10%. Programmes like ‘Campus with a Helmet’ and ‘Traffic Family Cop’ are planned to be initiated to bring down accidents,” Mr. Kumar said.Police have proposed suspension of driving licences of 2,242 people for violating traffic rules. They also plan to hold an exhibition of various vehicle theft alarms and ask people to invest in them. “We will also conduct drives to see if any vehicles are left unlocked and if found, will paste a sticker on them saying that this vehicle could get stolen,” Mr. Kumar said."

Later, he went to live in the back attic of an agent for the Insolvent Court, whom he wrote about inThe Old Curiosity Shop.He had to leave school, so that he could pay for his board and help his family. He worked 10 hours a day for which he earned six shillings a week. His job? Pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. A few months later, his grandmother passed away and she bequeathed a sum of money to his father that enabled him to pay his debts and be released from prison. The family left for Marshalsea in Southwark, London. However, to Charles’ great dismay, his mother never asked for him to be released from his job. He was sufficiently hurt, “I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back”.Back to schoolHe went back to school, after which he worked as a junior clerk at a law office. He later worked as a freelance reporter. By 20, though he lacked focus on what he wanted to become, he knew he wanted fame.In 1833, he submitted his first story “A Dinner at Poplar Walk” to the London periodicalMonthly Magazine. Two years later, he began a series onStreet Sketchesfor theMorning Chronicle.The Sketches by Bozbecame popular, and he received a proposal from publishers to supply text to match the illustrations for a monthly letterpress. The resulting story becamePickwick Papers, and in its final instalment sold 40,000 copies.Over time, his success as a novelist grew. It is said the young Queen Victoria readOliver TwistandPickwick Papers,and was enthralled by them.Nicholas Nickleby(1838–39),The Old Curiosity Shop(1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel,Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty, as part of theMaster Humphrey's Clockseries (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.On June 8, 1870, Dickens suffered a stroke from which he never recovered. He has stated that he wished to be buried at Rochester Cathedral “in an inexpensive, ostentatious and, strictly private manner”, but instead was laid to rest in the Poet’s Corner of Westminster Abbey."

Cops to work on vehicle thefts, accidents this year
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Navi Mumbai police have achieved a 66% success rate in detecting crimes last year, of the 5,515 cases registered with them. In 2017, they had a success rate of 72%, of the 4,561 cases registered.In the current year, vehicle thefts and accidents are an area of concern and would be the priority, said Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar, addressing the media on Wednesday. Mr. Kumar said there was was no specific reason for the decrease in the rate of detection. “There are a number of cases which cannot be detected, and that contributes to the number of undetected cases.”The case filesCases of attempt to murder have increased by 74%, rape by 17%, chain-snatching by 53%, other thefts by 51%, vehicle thefts by 44%, rioting by 70%, kidnapping by 47% and cheating by 27 %. At least 633 body offences were registered in 2017, of which 603 were detected while in 2018, 784 were registered of which 735 were detected. Nearly 1,802 property offences were registered in 2017, of which 845 were detected while 2,280 were registered in 2018 of which 974 were detected. At least 463 offences against women were registered in 2017, of which 455 were detected while in 2018, 546 were registered and 514 detected. Around 153 cases of rape were registered in which arrests were made in 151 cases. “Of the total rape cases, only three were done by unidentified persons. Around 47 were under the promise of marriage and in the rest of the cases, either a friend, neighbour or relative is involved,” Mr. Kumar said.ConvictionIn 2018, here were 22.03% convictions while in 2017, it was at 24.63%. “As compared to 2017, in 2018 around 772 more cases faced trial. The conviction rate has gone down by 2% due to factors like witnesses going hostile, unavailability of officers to stay present before court on the date due to other official commitments,” Mr. Kumar said. In 2018, 142 offences were registered under Protection of Children against Sexual Offence Act (POCSO) sections while in 2017, there were 120 cases. The conviction rate in 2017 was 18.96%, and it increased to 38% in 2018. “We will be reviewing the cases to see how the rate of conviction can be increased,” Mr Kumar said.The arrest of two accused helped Navi Mumbai police curb chain-snatching and POCSO cases. Around 50 chain-snatching cases were detected with the arrest of Fayyaz Khalid Shaikh (35) on October 19 and gold worth Rs. 57.69 lakh was recovered from him. Meanwhile, eight POCSO cases were detected with the arrest of Rehan Qureshi, who was also the accused in rape and murder cases in Nehru Nagar, Kurla.In cyber crime, around 75 cases were registered, of which 27 were detected. Phishing, debit card and credit card fraud constitute 15 cases and offences involving social media constitute 23 cases. “After working on five years’ data, we will find the hotspots in vehicle theft and accidents to curb them this year. Our aim is to have a decrease in fatal accidents by at least 10%. Programmes like ‘Campus with a Helmet’ and ‘Traffic Family Cop’ are planned to be initiated to bring down accidents,” Mr. Kumar said.Police have proposed suspension of driving licences of 2,242 people for violating traffic rules. They also plan to hold an exhibition of various vehicle theft alarms and ask people to invest in them. “We will also conduct drives to see if any vehicles are left unlocked and if found, will paste a sticker on them saying that this vehicle could get stolen,” Mr. Kumar said."

As numbers of some winter visitors dwindle, there are splashes of colour from elsewhere to keep the spirits up
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"For a good part of the mornings in Chennai now, the view is marred by a heavy haze effect. Recently, through a white film of fog, I sensed something bumbling through the branches of short trees overlooking the southern section of the Perumbakkam wetland. Following the clutter of claws on these branches, I saw a shock of brown and black settle awkardly on a redwood tree on the other side of the road. It was a greater coucal jumping from branch to branch with its characteristic two left feet.Walking down the road in Sholinganallur that trots alongside the southern section of the wetland, I once again focussed on the waterbirds. And then it caught my eye again; this time, with its partner in tow. They were exploring this heavily wooded residential area, which is still sparsely populated. A few mornings later, a resident told me about the pair. The same day, I laid eyes on them again. There is a glimmer of a hope that I may chance upon these birds with their brood soon. In these parts, greater coucals are known to breed after the monsoon. The koels and greater coucals belong to the Cuciloforms order. However, unlike the koels, which are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nest of other birds, usually crows, the greater coucals raise their young.As a pair ranges over a really wide area, considering it their territory, they may build their nest far removed from their many stomping grounds.However, knowing that these birds see the leaves of screw-pine trees as a great nesting space, I may take my luck with me to Thaiyur lake, where screw-pine trees grow wildly along the bunds. Well, birdwatcing is not only about patiently waiting for birds to show up. It's also about showing up wherever a bird life cycle takes it.***The other day, a bird watcher remarked that the northern shovelers have dwindled in numbers at the Perumbakkam wetland, which led me to focus my attention on this spatulate-billed dabbling duck.The northern shoveler is one of the four migratory ducks that arrive in large numbers in our parts at wintertime.This observer seemed to have got it right — their current number at the wetland is probably just one-fifth of what it was, only a month ago.The northern shoveler displays sexual dimorphism, which is striking during the breeding season. The male northern shoveler is a riot of green, white and chestnut. In the rest of the time, during various periods, the male may lose its iridescent green sheen due to factors such as moulting. At some of these periods, it may take on a shade that is not too removed from the female's. However, at any time, the black bill and the yellow in the eye, serve as the distinguishing marks of the male northern shoveler.Most of the male northern shovelers hanging around at this wetland still display some shades of their arresting combination of colours.***In the last column, I echoed birdwatchers' concern over fast-receding water levels on the southern section of the Perumbakkam wetland. However, this week showed that the situation is nowhere near as bad as feared. The section is hardly bleak. In the early part of this week, I witnessed a huge congregation of ruffs. On Sunday last, marsh sandpipers put on a great display.However, the news from a boggy patch near Akkarai, where I have noticed interesting birds flock, is disappointing. It has gone dry, dashing my hopes of clicking some good photographs of the little ringed plovers, which have been flocking there in modest numbers of five or six in the mornings. Last morning, when I set foot in this patch, I felt like Thomas Moore, who expressed desolation the best way it could be in his immortalThe Light Of Other Days: “I feel like one/ Who treads alone/ Some banquet-hall deserted!”There is however a happy takeaway from this section, this season — An image of a spotted dove as it was perched briefly on the dead branch of what had earlier been a prosopis juliflora tree. This bird, which is native to our parts, is a necklace-wearing beauty. Judge for yourself.Field Notes is a weekly column about the resident and winter-visiting birds of Chennai"

Former Minister for Youth and Sports Affairs Balakrishna Reddy, who was recently convicted and sentenced to three years’ jail in a case of rioting and destruction of government property, was accorded the centre-stage, to co-preside over an event by the Agriculture Department here on Wednesday.The sentence has been suspended as he had gone on an appeal. But, that he had been stripped of his ministerial berth, and had to even vacate his MLA seat (Hosur) in view of the conviction, seemed to have been lost on those who organised the event.On Wednesday, the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business organised a bhoomi puja for a flower marketing complex here.Mr. Reddy was given the pride of centre-stage at the event, with the district officials also present.Sporting a garland and in the company of Krishnagiri MP K. Ashok Kumar, District Revenue Officer S. Shanti and Hosur Sub Collector K.Vimal Raj, Mr. Reddy held a digging bar, symbolic of the stone laying ceremony.“Why does this surprise us, when straightforward questions of propriety over the continuance of Jayalalithaa’s portrait or a mausoleum for her were raised in view of her conviction, they were normalised and received sanctions from the courts themselves?”asked Hosur-based writer Aadhavan Deetchanya.WhenThe Hinducontacted the DRO she was in a meeting and said she would revert. But, she did not.“We had invited the MLAs, and maybe the local MP invited him (Mr. Reddy).

",,"The State government is willing to convene all-party talks for avoiding frequent hartals that disrupt normal life in the State, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan informed the Assembly on Monday.Certain forces that had no role whatsoever in the development of Kerala are trying to push the State backwards, he said during the question hour after P.K. Basheer of the IUML raised the matter in the House. The Chief Minister suggested that the initial discussions on hartals could be held outside the Assembly.He added that the government was also willing to consider the demand made by the Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala that the Kerala Regulation of Hartal Bill should be reintroduced in the Assembly.The bill was first presented in the Kerala Assembly by the previous UDF dispensation in 2015.“Normally, no political party will oppose hartals outright as they are a democratic way of protesting. But now it has brought a bad name to the State,” the Chief Minister said.In recent months, the State had witnessed a flurry of hartals over the Sabarimala-related protests.According to the Chief Minister, the January 3 hartal alone destroyed public property worth Rs. 28.43 lakh and private property worth more than Rs. 1.03 crore.“Public sentiment has turned against the frequent hartals. Let us see if we can create a consensus. At the same time, stern action will be taken against violence,” the Chief Minister said.Reacting to the hartal-related violence reported in Manjeswaram in Kasaragod, the Chief Minister attributed it to attempts to trigger communal riots."

The last swordsmith
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-last-swordsmith/article26102500.ece,"
At 90, Heeralal may just be the only surviving artisan of a centuries-old craft
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"There’s a din in the air and before me is a riot of colours. I am in Udaipur’s City Palace that is hosting its 4th World Living Heritage festival, where, despite all the brouhaha, I am drawn to an old man polishing a sword with what appears to be a wooden wheel held in place by a rotating stand. This is Heeralal, 90, perhaps the last surviving sikligar, or traditional swordsmith.Sikligars from Rajasthan polish, furbish and make swords as well as restore and sharpen old ones. Some 400-500 years ago they were a nomadic community and part of the king’s entourage during battle. Vandana Singh, Centre for Art Conservation & Research Experts, New Delhi, has worked with the community for over seven years. She says: “These craftsmen inherited their skill down the generations. The craft itself was a closely guarded secret and not documented anywhere. I spoke to many families and found that only one person, Heeralal, continues to practise the craft in the traditional way.”Like my soulThe craftsmen use rudimentary tools to polish the blades of the sword — emery stone, ash, horse shoe, ferni (a blade-sharpening machine) and deer horns for buffing as they don’t leave scratches on the blade’s surface. Swordsmiths also usechapadi,a mixture of river sand and lac melted together, to fix the handles on the sword blades. The swords then go into an oven orbattiand are quenched with sesame oil. In earlier times, the swords would only be tempered on moonless nights when the blade would gleam true.Heeralal’s son Ghanshyam speaks of how his grandfather worked with the royals, polishing and maintaining their swords. “He used to say the sword must be polished with traditional tools and not machines so that the temper is maintained. It also helped that in the past the quality of the iron used was superlative, which is not the case today. We shape the swords by hand just like sculptors,” he says.For Heeralal, the sword means everything. “It’s like my soul,” he says. “I don’t worry whether I make money or not. I value it far too much to let it go.”Magical powersDuring Navratri, in Heeralal’s village Ameth, swords are placed before an idol of the goddess Durga and worshipped. They are believed to gain magical powers. “The swords are then viewed entirely differently, as spiritually charged ritual objects,” says Singh. After the nine days of festivities, the sword is taken out on a procession, as villagers dance with swords while some of them strike themselves with it by way of asking for forgiveness for past sins.Traditional conservation techniques are part of the ‘Arm and Armours’ project at the City Palace, and Shriji Arvind Singh Mewar of Udaipur is overseeing the effort. Singh and her team are working on cleaning, conserving and restoring as well as documenting the weapons in the armoury here. They are also merging traditional smithing with advanced nano materials to restore and repair old swords. “Carbon fibres and carbon nanotubes have been used as the reinforced materials and pure lac is used as a matrix material. These are non-toxic and biodegradable,” says Singh.However, as with most things traditional, the challenge is the lack of demand. Sikligars now use their skills to make scissors.But Singh and her team have begun to document the dying art by interviewing the remaining swordsmiths and organising live demonstrations to rekindle interest in the art form. The sikligars might yet get another innings.The freelance writer and photographer from Bengaluru seeks offbeat experiences through travel.The Arm and Armour project merges traditional smithing with advanced nano materials to restore old swords"

The banality of India ",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/the-banality-of-india/article26100923.ece,,https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When Hannah Arendt witnessed the trial of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi General, in Jerusalem, she was taken aback. Reporting forTheNew Yorker, she went to Jerusalem for the trials, and also to see things in a post-War scenario. However, she was taken aback to hear what Eichmann had to say. He had no remorse for whatever crimes he had committed. He did not feel anything because he was doing it in the sheer fashion of bureaucracy. It compelled Hannah’s thoughts to cross the limits of pre-existing “normal” and come up with the thought of a new normal, or the “banality of evil”.Banality means unoriginal of the truest sense; a sense that is normal enough to lack even slightest interest and becomes boring. She wrote about how the crimes committed against humanity in Germany were nothing unusual for the Nazi soldiers. When she talks about the banality of evil, she refers to how evil has found its place in a world where people not only do wrong but even try to justify that without realising the gravity of their sins.The case of the Gujarat riots where even swords were used to slay members of a minority community, or the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that shook the country, or the interview of the youngest culprit of the Nirbhaya case, show the banality of evil in our society. In the latest form of “cow protection groups”, or as these are often quoted “the cow vigilantes”, we are facing a similar situation. We see people taking the law into their hands with the justification ready. It becomes painful when the culprits are honoured by a few for their political benefits.The murder of a police inspector in Bulandshahr while trying to perform his duty, or the lynching of a Google engineer in Karnataka, put forward examples of the sheer banality with which crimes are being committed without any remorse.A Minister from Uttar Pradesh said people were crying over the death of one inspector when more than 20 cows had been killed. I want to ask him how can he justify the death of one man who was in his uniform and performing his duty? Would he react the same if it was his family member who faced the wreath of the mob?Our social values have taught us that violence in all its forms must be condemned. However, it seems we are now trying to justify violence in all its forms for the sake of political gains. Whether it is the case of mob lynchings, or the murder of a scribe. None of the major political parties seem to remain an exception to this.End of the day, it is not very difficult to conclude that Hannah Arendt was not wrong after all in saying that modernity has given rise to the banality of evil. It remains true even in a society like India that has had deep cultural roots since time immemorial.singhws8@gmail.com"

",,"Blame the Free Press Journal for the rise and rise of Bal Thackeray. At least Abhijit Panse’s biographical film holds the newspaper responsible as the trigger for his political career. The news room, dominated by ‘South Indians’, where Thackeray was one of the only two Marathi employees, where he was treated like a worker rather than an artiste, where his cartoons didn’t like the owners, forcing him to resign, also appears to have stoked his predisposition towards ‘‘apna aadmi(our people)’ i.e. Marathi manoos.As per the film, ‘Marathi manoos campaign’ kicked off an intense sensitivity and anger about Maharashtrians being ‘squeezed out’ in their own homeland by the ‘annas, Iranis, Gujaratis, Punjabis’ and more. While we might be critical about Siddiqui choosing to play Thackeray after being Manto, he is magnetic, at the top of his game in delivering what he is expected to, that terrible prosthetic nose notwithstanding.So the tiger roars on. Thackeray talks about how it is better to be agunda(a criminal) than ajhandu(a moron to put it politely); he talks about how the Marathis had been welcoming outsiders with folded hands but will now break those of the visitors/guests; he talks about how power doesn’t quite emanate from the inches your chest measures but how agile your brain is.The terrible, incendiary language of the film is stitched to the figure it centres on. There is no apology or regret for the sectarian politics, hate speech and provocative talk; in fact it’s articulated with immense impunity, cussedness and arrogance on screen. Fire has to be lit to wipe away darkness. Violence will be unleashed if his writ is not followed. Democracy is anti-people. The bier of his men killed in riots is symbolic of the coffin of democracy itself. The nation deserves a Hitler. The contradictions also accumulate: Javed Miandad will be welcomed with snacks and tea but Pakistani team won’t be allowed to play in his state. Eid will be celebrated with gusto but Muslims will also have to participate in the Shiv Jayanti functions with as much vigour.It’s a one-man show. The film portrays Thackeray as fiery, fearsome, larger than life figure whose writ runs large and unquestioningly in Maharashtra. He can incite violence and also curb it, he can bring down the law and order machinery and also restore it.The film is not just a justification but a no-holds-barred celebration of the ruthlessness."

The banality of India

Reporting forTheNew Yorker, she went to Jerusalem for the trials, and also to see things in a post-War scenario. However, she was taken aback to hear what Eichmann had to say. He had no remorse for whatever crimes he had committed. He did not feel anything because he was doing it in the sheer fashion of bureaucracy. It compelled Hannah’s thoughts to cross the limits of pre-existing “normal” and come up with the thought of a new normal, or the “banality of evil”.Banality means unoriginal of the truest sense; a sense that is normal enough to lack even slightest interest and becomes boring. She wrote about how the crimes committed against humanity in Germany were nothing unusual for the Nazi soldiers. When she talks about the banality of evil, she refers to how evil has found its place in a world where people not only do wrong but even try to justify that without realising the gravity of their sins.The case of the Gujarat riots where even swords were used to slay members of a minority community, or the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that shook the country, or the interview of the youngest culprit of the Nirbhaya case, show the banality of evil in our society. In the latest form of “cow protection groups”, or as these are often quoted “the cow vigilantes”, we are facing a similar situation. We see people taking the law into their hands with the justification ready. It becomes painful when the culprits are honoured by a few for their political benefits.The murder of a police inspector in Bulandshahr while trying to perform his duty, or the lynching of a Google engineer in Karnataka, put forward examples of the sheer banality with which crimes are being committed without any remorse.A Minister from Uttar Pradesh said people were crying over the death of one inspector when more than 20 cows had been killed. I want to ask him how can he justify the death of one man who was in his uniform and performing his duty? Would he react the same if it was his family member who faced the wreath of the mob?Our social values have taught us that violence in all its forms must be condemned. However, it seems we are now trying to justify violence in all its forms for the sake of political gains. Whether it is the case of mob lynchings, or the murder of a scribe. None of the major political parties seem to remain an exception to this.End of the day, it is not very difficult to conclude that Hannah Arendt was not wrong after all in saying that modernity has given rise to the banality of evil. It remains true even in a society like India that has had deep cultural roots since time immemorial.singhws8@gmail.com"

The traditional swordsmiths of Udaipur ",https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-traditional-swordsmiths-of-udaipur/article26088141.ece,"
At 90, Heeralal may just be the only surviving artisan of a centuries-old craft
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"There’s a din in the air and before me is a riot of colours. I am in Udaipur’s City Palace that is hosting its 4th World Living Heritage festival, where, despite all the brouhaha, I am drawn to an old man polishing a sword with what appears to be a wooden wheel held in place by a rotating stand. This is Heeralal, 90, perhaps the last surviving sikligar, or traditional swordsmith.Sikligars from Rajasthan polish, furbish and make swords as well as restore and sharpen old ones. Some 400-500 years ago they were a nomadic community and part of the king’s entourage during battle.Vandana Singh, Centre for Art Conservation & Research Experts, New Delhi, has worked with the community for over seven years. She says: “These craftsmen inherited their skill down the generations. The craft itself was a closely guarded secret and not documented anywhere. I spoke to many families and found that only one person, Heeralal, continues to practise the craft in the traditional way.”Like my soulThe craftsmen use rudimentary tools to polish the blades of the sword — emery stone, ash, horse shoe, ferni (a blade-sharpening machine) and deer horns for buffing as they don’t leave scratches on the blade’s surface. Swordsmiths also usechapadi,a mixture of river sand and lac melted together, to fix the handles on the sword blades.Intricately carved sheathed daggers

In earlier times, the swords would only be tempered on moonless nights when the blade would gleam true.Heeralal’s son Ghanshyam speaks of how his grandfather worked with the royals, polishing and maintaining their swords. “He used to say the sword must be polished with traditional tools and not machines so that the temper is maintained. It also helped that in the past the quality of the iron used was superlative, which is not the case today. We shape the swords by hand just like sculptors,” he says.For Heeralal, the sword means everything. “It’s like my soul,” he says. “I don’t worry whether I make money or not. I value it far too much to let it go.”Magical powersThe swordsmith Heeralal

They are believed to gain magical powers. “The swords are then viewed entirely differently, as spiritually charged ritual objects,” says Singh. After the nine days of festivities, the sword is taken out on a procession, as villagers dance with swords while some of them strike themselves with it by way of asking for forgiveness for past sins.Traditional conservation techniques are part of the ‘Arm and Armours’ project at the City Palace, and Shriji Arvind Singh Mewar of Udaipur is overseeing the effort. Singh and her team are working on cleaning, conserving and restoring as well as documenting the weapons in the armoury here. They are also merging traditional smithing with advanced nano materials to restore and repair old swords. “Carbon fibres and carbon nanotubes have been used as the reinforced materials and pure lac is used as a matrix material. These are non-toxic and biodegradable,” says Singh.A carved sword handle

Sikligars now use their skills to make scissors.But Singh and her team have begun to document the dying art by interviewing the remaining swordsmiths and organising live demonstrations to rekindle interest in the art form. The sikligars might yet get another innings.The freelance writer and photographer from Bengaluru seeks offbeat experiences through travel."

Reverence, relevance, restoration

A century-old residence gets a makeover, yet retains its glory at the hands of architect Husna Rahamanwho deftly plays with hues and patterns. By Nandhini Sundar
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When an architect is faced with a century-old residence or even one that is half the age, his/her immediate reaction is to demolish and develop the site or build a fabulous contemporary dwelling, money and space permitting.Today, restoring such a building to its former glory is beyond the radar, especially given the economics behind such an initiative. The state of the structure and the lifestyle the interior facilities offer, further promote this inclination.But when architect Husna Rahaman of Fulcrum Studio was given the century-old sprawling 7,000 sq. ft colonial home for restoration — the structure essentially a no-nonsense load-bearing piece of engineering that cannot be tampered with on whim — she realised that strategic alterations, if any, could happen only where necessary.The entire restoration thus occurred on a delicate balance of reverence and relevance, the regal aura retained while the modern functional quotient was brought in where relevant.Playing with patternsIn tune with the era it related to, the residence came with its accompanying hues and patterns that literally saturated the spaces, the patterned antique floor and wall tiles engulfing the ambience.And so, without shunning this past grandeur, Rahaman set about managing deftly the play of hues and patterns where they would enchant and refresh, without submerging the senses. “It was literally a riot of colours and this base was used as a spring board to complement the residence where it is not eliminated but used to balance,” she explains.Keeping this intent in perspective, an elegant network of wood verticals and horizontals were brought in to frame the length and breadth of the expansive living area.A new set of chandeliers were added, yet the design of these were kept deliberately colonial in keeping with the structure’s flavour.The rich flooring was retained, along with the porcelain tile dadoing on the walls, both in the living area as well as rest of the residence.A refreshing contemporary twist was brought into the home by introducing metal motifs on the walls, the motifs reflecting the existing patterns. While the walls and the ceiling continue to accommodate the wooden columns and beams, a colourful reminder of the colonial past, the architect ensures a contemporary flavour wafts into the sturucture through concealed lights and varied metal motifs.Contemporary upgradeThe living area reveals the presence of two groups of furniture, each connected by a large back-to-back sofa cluster. The unusual blend of materials and styles seen in the living area and carried methodically into the rest of the residence, where luxury is paired with minimalism and exquisite Indian crafts tie in seamlessly with streamlined forms, reveals a reverential contemporary upgrade of a glorious past.While the strong imperial character of the structure has been reverentially retained, the spaces have been infused with warmth to address the home it ultimately is. This has been successfully achieved through application of soft roses on the walls, neutral colours with subtle pops of colour in the rugs, strips of wallpaper and cushions in shades of pink and orange.Likewise, the spatial poetry of the house, an element lacking in modern crowded structures, has been preserved to integrate the multiple rooms.Infusing metalGiven the era of the residence, metal does not figure in its construction. Yet, metal has been craftily infiused nto the stately space, lightening the palette.The floral medallion in the living area serves as a symbolic confluence of the metallic motifs used in the rest of the residence. Metal also features as an artistic railing for the staircase, replacing the previous cement and brick staircase. The terrace further reveals a stunning dark grey metal gazebo to unwind and relax, besides serving as an entertainment zone when need arises.Sun roomThe first level of the building came with narrow spaces, yet the interiors were filled with abundant natural light. Rahaman decided to capture this effectively to create a sunny library. “The room came with its quota of colours and patterns like the rest of the house and the space was converted into a turquoise library with a western exposure by merely introducing rugs into the space,” she says.The ‘sun room’ reveals rugs in intense hues of ochre and turquoise blue, soaked in geometric patterns where they define the floor, with the turquoise blue and wood verticals on the walls complementing the same. Vibrant in conception, the space greets with a burst of exuberance, the twin daybeds created between the columns further enhancing with their presence.The contemporary flavour wafts into the spaces through concealed lights and metal motifs"

‘Thackeray’ review: Parochial politics
",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/thackeray-review-parochial-politics/article26091736.ece,"
Marathi manoos, Babri Masjid demolition and Hindutvavaad, expectedly, don’t just find a thumping approval but are glorified in the latest Bollywood biopic
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Blame the Free Press Journal for the rise and rise of Bal Thackeray. At least Abhijit Panse’s biographical film holds the newspaper responsible as the trigger for his political career. The news room, dominated by “South Indians”, where Thackeray was one of the only two Marathi employees, where he was treated like a worker rather than an artiste, where his cartoons didn’t like the owners, eventually forcing him to resign, also appears to have stoked his predisposition towards “apna aadmi (our people)” i.e. Marathi manoos.Thackeray (Hindi/Marathi)Director: Abhijit PanseStarring: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Amrita RaoRun time: 120 minutesStoryline: A biographical film on Bal Thackeray, the founder of Shiv SenaAs per the film, ‘Marathi manoos campaign’ kicked off an intense sensitivity and anger about Maharashtrians being “squeezed out” in their own homeland by the “annas”, the “Iranis”, the “Gujaratis”, the “Punjabis” and more. “Ghati ghatiya nahin hai (The man from the Ghats is not some cheapster that you can take for granted)”, thunders Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Thackeray. While we might be critical about Siddiqui choosing to play Thackeray after being Manto, he is magnetic, at the top of his game in delivering what he is expected to, that terrible prosthetic nose notwithstanding.So the tiger roars on. Thackeray talks about how it is better to be a gunda (a criminal) than a jhandu (a moron to put it politely); he talks about how the Marathis had been welcoming outsiders with folded hands but will now break those of the visitors/guests; he talks about how power doesn’t quite emanate from the inches your chest measures (foresight about 56, is it?) but how agile your brain is. He makes a mockery of the South Indians: “Baja pungi, hata lungi (slang demeaning the mundu-veshti wearers, roughly translates as sound the bugle and get rid of the lungi-clad South Indians).The terrible, incendiary language of the film is stitched to the figure it centres on. There is no apology or regret for the sectarian politics, hate speech and provocative talk; in fact it’s articulated with immense impunity, cussedness and arrogance on screen. Fire has to be lit to wipe away darkness. Violence will be unleashed if his writ is not followed. Democracy is anti-people. The bier of his men killed in riots is symbolic of the coffin of democracy itself. The nation deserves a Hitler. The contradictions also accumulate: Javed Miandad will be welcomed with snacks and tea but Pakistani team won’t be allowed to play in his state. Eid will be celebrated with gusto but Muslims will also have to participate in the Shiv Jayanti functions with as much vigour.It’s a one-man show. The film portrays Thackeray as this fiery, fearsome, larger than life figure whose writ runs large and unquestioningly in Maharashtra. He can incite violence and also curb it, he can bring down the law and order machinery and also restore it. The film is not just a justification but a no holds barred celebration of the ruthlessness.The token soft, sympathetic side on display then feels utterly superfluous--saving the “besahara” (helpless) doodhwala (milkman) from his own men, letting a Muslim do namaaz in his living room in Matoshree. Thackeray’s fight is not against the religion but against the sinners, he says; desh for him is before rajya (country before state) and 80% of his party work is about social work than politics.Between Thackeray’s followers who will rationalise everything about him and find the film charismatic and the detractors who will find it unconvincing and abhorrent, lies a hagiography in continuum. The sequel to Thackeray, it seems, will soon be upon us."

They had vandalised the Treasury Branch of the SBI on Jan. 9 during the general strike
",,"A district court here on Friday denied bail to eight government service organisation leaders suspected to be responsible for the attack on the Treasury Branch of the State Bank of India, next door to the Secretariat, on the second day of the national strike by trade unions on January 9.The court rejected their bail on the ground that the case was one of grave nature. It remanded the trade union functionaries, most of them NGO union office-bearers, in judicial custody till February 7.The police had earlier booked the service organisation leaders on suspicion of having damaged public property, indulged in rioting, unlawful assembly and trespass.The offence carries a punishment of up to five years of imprisonment and fine or both. If found guilty, the suspects run the risk of dismissal from service.The State government had suspended the officials from service pending inquiry. The police had sent reports to the respective department heads of the suspects detailing their alleged involvement in the crime.Video footageThe police had relied on ‘smoking gun’ video footage from the bank’s security cameras to identify the accused. Regardless of the massive police presence in the high-security locality, a set of trade unionists sauntered into the bank, intimidated staff and wrecked office equipment wantonly. Investigators had also recorded the eyewitness accounts of bank staff, including the manager, who had reported for work on the strike day.The police said the suspects had smashed an office computer, manhandled the manager and damaged his official mobile phone and vandalised furniture. They pegged the loss to the public exchequer at Rs. 1.5 lakh."

New-Delhi based Keventers open their first outlet in Visakhapatnam ",,"At a corner of the ever-bustling street of Beach Road, the newly-opened Keventers would be hard to miss. With brightly-lit interiors and vibrantly decorated name board, the place is an eye-catcher.Tapping into the dairy-loving patrons of the city, the New-Delhi based Keventers is stirring the hearts of the city’s milkshake lovers. The outlet that opened last year on December 31 has a outdoor seating area that gives a scenic view of the beach.I visit the place on a windy evening with clear skies and the view of a calm sea. To begin with, I order my all-time favourite exotic mango milkshake and a sundae called ‘guilty pleasure’. A sip of the refreshingly cold mango milkshake drains the day’s boredom out of me. For those who love sweetened milkshake, the thick and creamy drink is a must-try. However, for someone like me, who does not have a sweet tooth, the milkshake was a sugary affair.Keventers, Beach RoadHitsGuilty pleasure sundaeMissesExotic mango thickshakeCost₹100 to ₹29063057 96836Next, I turn to the sundae that I would definitely be guilty of having (calories count!). A dollop of ice cream topped with generous chocolate sauce and served along with chocolate crumbles and choco chips is a go-to thing for chocolate lovers. The different flavours of dark chocolate, chocolate sauce and mocha syrup complement each other well to cause a riot of chocolaty flavours. If chocolate is not your thing, you could try vanilla ice cream-based sundaes, Yin and Yang or the Forbidden Forest. Serving the best of both classic and contemporary worlds, the menu has over 20 milkshakes categorised into six segments that include classic shakes like rasamalai, cold coffee, vanilla and butter and contemporary ones like snicker superior and mint Oreo crumble. The outlet also serves ice cream soda and thickshakes.“The response has been overwhelming. We see more of the younger generation coming in to grab a milkshake and hang out at the beach side. It is also the age group of 15 to 35 years that experiments and tries different shakes on the menu. The older generation seems to be in love with the classic drinks,” says Kalyana Sahithi Nanduri, owner of the city’s outlet. She adds that chocolate-based shakes are the most preferred among the youngsters while the older crowd prefers classic drinks like kaju anjeer or rose badam. The brand sticks to its signature takeaway glass bottles and serves the milkshakes along with vibrant white and yellow paper straws. However, a huge disappointment is the plastic spoons which, Sahithi assues, will be soon replaced with bamboo spoons. She also plans to introduce board games in the coming weeks to add a flavour of good old days."

From Indian Constitution’s architect Ambedkar and the Constitution itself to the freedom struggle that preceded its formation, here’s a history of how the Republic Day came to be...all arranged alphabetically for you!
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Ambedkar B.R.Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was an economist, jurist and social reformer. Having suffered humiliation from a very young age due to his caste, he fought relentlessly against discrimination, especially those arising from religion, caste and gender. Equally importantly, he was also the chief architect of the Indian Constitution. Only days after our country gained Independence from the British, Ambedkar was made the head of the Constitution Drafting Committee. He penned the draft that offered constitutional guarantees and protection for a host of civil liberties for the citizens, including freedom of religion and the abolition of untouchability. It also disallowed any kind of discrimination.A.O. HumeWhen we think of India’s story of Independence, we start at 1857, the year Indian sepoys rebelled against the British. Indian history took a major turn after this. One happening was the birth of Indian National Congress (INC). It was founded with the help of Allen Octavian Hume, a retired British official. The first session of INC was held in Bombay in December 1885.Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army)Subhas Chandra Bose, who was President of the Congress in 1938 and 1939, resigned because he did not agree with Gandhi’s views. He formed the All India Forward Bloc. He opposed India joining World War II (WWII). In 1940, the British put Bose under house arrest in Calcutta. He escaped to Nazi Germany hoping to raise an army with Hitler and Mussolini’s help to fight the British. Hitler advised Bose to go to Japan and arrange for a submarine. Bose reorganised the defunct Indian National Army. The Azad Hind Fauj or INA fought the British Indian army in Arakan, Burma and Assam with the Japanese Army. But the INA could not sustain itself and surrendered to the British in 1945.Bengal Partition, 1905The British rule in India has been recognised as one of “divide and rule”. So when Lord Curzon, Viceroy and Governor-General ordered Bengal to be broken into two for “better administration”, it was clear the action was meant to separate Hindus and Muslims into two areas. The partition made the Bengalis very angry. Nationalists such as Sri Aurobindo, Bhupendranath Datta and Bipin Chandra Pal wrote strong newspaper articles against the British rule. King George V cancelled the partition of Bengal, which was eventually unified in 1911.Constitution of IndiaOur country is a Democratic Republic with a parliamentary system of government. This Republic is governed in terms of the Constitution of India, which was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949 and came into force on January 26, 1950. The Constitution is a living document, an instrument that makes the government system work. The sections of the Constitution cover citizenship, fundamental rights, directive principles of State policy and fundamental duties, in addition to several others. It empowered India’s people to rule themselves by selecting their own government.Cripps MissionNeeding help with WWII, the British government sent a delegation to India under Stafford Cripps. Its mission was to get total cooperation of the Congress and the Indian leaders for Britain’s war. In return Indians would be given more power in elected legislatures. They could make their own constitution. Cripps’ Mission failed. Why only dominion-status under British rule, the leaders asked. Where is the timeframe for self-government? Gandhi made the famous call: Let’s “Do or Die”.Dandi MarchIn January 1930, Gandhi demanded the abolition of salt tax. Gandhi threatened to begin a disobedience campaign if the demands were not met. With demands not met, on 12 March, 1930, with volunteers, Gandhi started walking from Sabarmathi Ashram to Dandi. Thousands joined him enroute. On 6 April 1930 Gandhi reached Dandi, and made salt symbolically by boiling sea water. It meant Indians had the right to make salt and would not pay salt tax. Satyagrahis were attacked. A worried Gandhi agreed to attend the second Round Table Conference if political prisoners were released.East India CompanyIn the Battle of Plassey of 1757, Robert Clive and the East India Company’s Indian army defeated the Nawab of Bengal, successfully fought the Battle of Buxar in 1764 and began to rule areas of Bengal, Bihar and parts of Orissa. In south India, the East India Company’s army defeated Tipu Sultan and most of South India came either under the Company’s direct or indirect rule. It spread its control over regions ruled by Marathas too. The East India Company’s authority in India came to an end with the sepoy mutiny.First to Third Round Table ConferencesAs Indian leaders continued to demand independence, the British called for a Round Table Conference in 1930 to consider the constitution of India. The Simon Commission, booed in India, had recommended measures from the Government of India Act of 1919. The report was published in 1930. The conference was held in London. The session (November 12, 1930 to January 19, 1931) had 73 representatives from all Indian States and all parties except the Congress, busy with civil disobedience campaign. The members agreed on a parliamentary form of government for India as a dominion under the British king. The second session ( September 7 to December 1, 1931) was attended by Mahatma Gandhi as the Congress representative. He rejected communal representation and asked for constitutional reforms for self-rule, which the British did not agree to. Neither the Congress nor the British Labour Party attended the third session (November 17 to December 24, 1932). The RTCs failed.Gandhi-Irwin PactAt the Lahore session of Congress, the INC decided that 26 January 1930 should be observed all over India as the Purna Swaraj Day. In March 1931, the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed, and the government agreed to set all political prisoners free. But revolutionaries were not set free, death sentence for Bhagat Singh and his two comrades was not taken back. Congress continued its protest against the government. As Gandhi’s Civil Disobedience Movement became stronger, the British parliament passed the Government of India Act in August 1935. It proposed a Federation of India - comprising British India, some or all of the princely states. The Federation idea failed as many princely states did not join it.Home-Rule LeagueAnnie Besant, co-founder of the Theosophical Society in Chennai, launched the Home Rule (self-government) movement on 1 August, 1916. Around the same time, Bal Gangadhar Tilak had founded Home Rule for India League. The popularity of the Home Rule movement alarmed the British government. Tilak was imprisoned. But the government’s harsh measures created great public enthusiasm. The movement forced the British government to allow Indians freedom to rule themselves at certain levels of administration.Indian Sepoy MutinyFrom 1757, the British East India Company had been bringing Indian areas under its rule, and expanding Indian army. The conditions of service came into conflict. The final spark was the rumoured use of cow and pig fat in the newly introduced rifle cartridges, which the soldiers had to bite before loading into rifles, in 1857. The soldiers were offended. An open battle began. Later sepoys in Meerut refused the cartridges, and were put in jail. This punishment angered their comrades, who rose on May 10, shot their British officers, and marched to Delhi, where the local sepoy garrison joined them. By nightfall they had made old Bahadur Shah II the emperor. Soon the mutiny spread throughout northern India. But Indians lost their battles and British India was taken over by the government.Jallianwala Bagh massacreThe Legislative Council in Delhi passed the Rowlatt Act in 1919 that allowed the government to put people in jail without trial. On 13 April, 1919, Baishaki Day, a crowd gathered at Jallianwala Bagh, a maidan next to the Golden Temple, Amritsar. General Dyer appeared with his armed policemen and ordered them to open fire on the people. There was no escape. Hundreds including women and children were gunned down.Khilafat MovementIn 1919 in India, brothers Mohammad Ali Jauhar and Shaukat Ali started the Khilafat Movement and demanded the British (which had captured Turkey in WWI), that the Caliph must retain all Muslim holy places and he must be returned his pre-war territories. Meanwhile, Gandhi convinced the Congress that supporting the Khilafat movement would cement Hindu-Muslim unity. In 1920, Congress approved the non-co-operation-civil disobedience movement that the Khilafat leaders had announced. In 1922, the people of Turkey rose under Mustafa Kamal Pasha, and overthrew the sultan. Soon the caliphate was abolished, and the Khilafat movement became meaningless.Lucknow PactIndian leaders had agreed to help the British government to fight the WWI. But the government was indifferent to the suffering war caused to people. The groups within the Congress decided to oppose the British. In 1916, the Congress succeeded in bringing about the Lucknow Pact, wherein the Muslim League and the Congress would form a temporary alliance to discuss devolution of political power and the future of Islam in India.Montagu-Chelmsford ReformsIn 1918, Chelmsford, the Viceroy of India and Montagu, Secretary of Indian Council submitted a proposal to the British Parliament, which became an Act in 1919. It reduced the authority of the Secretary of the State’s India Council and gave more powers to the Viceroy and his Council. It created “Diarchy” by dividing the powers of the central and the state governments. But Indian leaders resented the additional power of the Viceroy and the limited voting rights for the Indians.Non-Cooperation MovementGandhi, who was a lawyer in South Africa, had been watching the Indian National Movement. He returned to India in 1915 to join it. He would fight foreign oppression through Satyagraha or moral domination. Satyagraha was “passive resistance” – no guns, no beating, no stone-throwing. Gandhi was convinced his efforts to get freedom would not succeed without the support of the masses. Their problems had to be solved for them to join the freedom movement, he realised. In 1917, he tried the Satyagraha experiment of non-violent, non-co-operation in Champaran-Bihar, against the tyrannical European planters. It soon won the support of the Indian National Congress. Jallianwala Bagh killings and the harsh punishment that followed made it clear that Indians would not be treated fairly by the British government. Gandhi decided not to co-operate with this government. He would not let them rule unless they listened to the people’s demands. This movement from 1920-22 was a great success. It got massive encouragement from millions of Indians. Very importantly, it shook the British authorities for the support it gathered across the country.Other heroes of the Freedom StrugglePuli Thevar(based in Trinelveli, Tamil Nadu, he confronted the Nawab of Arcot and Marudhanayagam for their support to the British)Prince Kerala Varma Pazhassi Rajaof Kottiyur, North Malabar (gathered the tribals of Wayanad to fight a guerrilla war against the British between 1774 and 1805)Rani Velu Nachiyarof Sivaganga (the first Indian queen to take on the British)Veerapandiya Kattabomman(18th century chieftain from Panchalankurichi in Tamil Nadu, who fought the East India Company; captured by the British and hanged in 1799)Dheeran Chinnamalai(a Kongu chieftain from Tamil Nadu who fought against the East India Company)Jayee Rajguru(the chief of Army of Kalinga requested all the kings in the Orissa region to join hands against the British; he was killed on 6 December 1806)Poona PactThe British policy of “divide and rule” that included separate voting rights for various groups of citizens created many problems. Ambedkar asked that dalits would vote for dalits. He wanted them to have political power. Gandhi opposed caste / community-based electorates. He thought it would create disunity, and went on a fast. Finally, Gandhi and Ambedkar signed the Poona Pact in September, 1932. Gandhi agreed to allow reservation of seats for dalits in legislatures. Ambedkar agreed to give up demand for separate electorates.Partition of India and PakistanBritain and allies won WWII. The Labour Party, under PM Clement Attlee, came to power in Britain. A Cabinet Mission was sent to India in March 1946. It proposed the formation of a Constituent Assembly of members elected by the provincial legislatures and nominees of the Indian States. An interim Government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru was formed. However, the Muslim League refused to participate in the deliberations of the Constituent Assembly and pressed for Pakistan. Lord Mountbatten, the Viceroy of India, presented a plan for the division of India into India and Pakistan. India was partitioned.Quit India MovementOn 8 August 1942, at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement. The aim of the movement was to force the British Government to agree to give India self-rule. In his public speech, Gandhi made his famous call to “Do or Die”. Most Congress leaders were put in jail less than 24 hours after Gandhi's speech. Many of them spent the rest of the war in jail. The Quit India Movement was crushed by the police and the army.Republic DayWe all know that the Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949. But it was formally adopted on January 26, 1950 and that was the day chosen to be celebrated as Republic Day. But why was the date January 26 chosen? It was chosen as it was the anniversary of Purna Swaraj Day (the declaration of complete Independence), procliamed by the Indian National Congress on January 26 - exactly 20 years earlier - in 1930.AsThe Hindu’s editorial on the historic day rightly said, “The inauguration of the Republic of India is an act of high faith in the people of this country, a gesture of dedication of all the nation’s talent and resources to the realisation of worthy purposes.”Rowlatt ActIn 1917, Scottish judge Rowlatt was appointed to investigate the “revolutionary conspiracies” on Indian leaders. His report suggested imprisonment without trial, censorship and house arrest of suspects. The commission's proposals were incorporated into the Rowlatt Act in 1919. Jinnah resigned from the Council in protest and wrote a furious letter to Chelmsford. The Act was repealed in 1922, but the damage had been done. Indians called it the “Black Act” as it allowed the British to jail anyone if he was suspected of plotting against the British. The Rowlatt Act sparked huge anger among the common people. Gandhi and the other leaders called for hartal, which was ended by Gandhi when riots and violence broke out.Simon CommissionThe Government of India Act 1919 had introduced the system of diarchy to govern the provinces of British India. The Act had stated that a commission would be appointed after 10 years to investigate the progress of the scheme and suggest changes. Under Sir John Simon, a group of seven British MPs was sent to India in 1928 for the review. One of its members was Clement Attlee (who subsequently became the British Prime Minister and granted independence to India and Pakistan in 1947). There was a chorus of protest by all Indians to a commission without Indian representation. The Congress, in its December 1927 meeting in Madras resolved to boycott the Commission. When the commission landed in Bombay on February 3, 1928, a countrywide hartal was organised. Wherever the commission went, there were black flag demonstrations, and slogans of ‘Simon Go Back’. The outcome of the Simon Commission was the Government of India Act 1935, which established representative government in the provinces. In the first elections in 1937 Congress formed government in nearly all provinces.Tryst with DestinyOn August 15, 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of free India, made a speech in the parliament expressing the feelings of all Indians. “Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we will redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially,” the speech began. It is considered one of the greatest speeches of the 20th century, as it captures victory of the Indian independence struggle.Under the British MonarchyThe revolt by the soldiers in 1857 brought an end to the 100-year rule by East India Company. The British government decided to bring the administration of British India under the direct rule of England. Queen Victoria made a Proclamation of November 1, 1858: India would be governed in the name of the British Monarch through a Secretary of State. The Governor-General would be called Viceroy. Queen Victoria would be Empress of India. This gave the British Government unlimited powers to decide the affairs of Indian states. The British gave their support to the loyal princes, zamindar and local chiefs but neglected the masses. People’s anger mounted, and soon Indian National Movement took shape.Vellore Sepoy RevoltNot many people know this episode of India’s independence story. Long before the Sepoy Mutiny, soldiers at the Vellore Fort rebelled against the British. One of them was the rule that soldiers could not wear caste marks. At that time, the Vellore Fort had four companies of soldiers, many of them Indians. Two hours after midnight, on 10 July, 1806, the sepoys in the fort shot down European sentries, killed 14 officers including Colonel St. John Fancourt the commander and 115 men sleeping in their barracks. The rebels took control and raised the Mysore kingdom’s flag over the fort. Tipu’s second son Fateh Hyder was declared king. However, a British officer escaped and alerted the garrison in Arcot. Nine hours later, a British relief force led by Sir Robert Rollo Gillespie reached Vellore with 20 men, and bloody retribution followed. Nearly 350 rebels were killed and 350 were wounded before the fighting stopped.World War IWar broke out in Europe in 1914 and the Indian leaders including Jinnah decided to support the British with men and resources. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money and ammunition. Only Bengal and Punjab were anti colonial. The First World War brought huge loss and suffering to Indian masses. Many families had lost their men, food prices soared, trade shut down, the British imposed more taxes. Influenza epidemic broke out.X-factorX-factor means a change in a given situation that has the most significant impact on what happens neXt. Pick any five from the freedom story.Young IndiaBetween 1919 and 1931, Gandhi published Young India, a weekly paper in English. Many of the things he wrote in this journal inspired many. He used Young India to spread his ideas about non-violent methods of organising movements. He urged Indians to consider, organise, and plan for freedom from British rule.Yerwada JailYerwada Central Jail was built in 1871 by the British outside Pune. Under British rule, freedom fighters were routinely sent to this prison. Between 1930–42, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Netaji Subhas Bose and Bal Gangadhar Tilak spent time there. Gandhi signed the Poona Pact in the Yerwada jail on 24 September 1932.Zeal of IndiansThrough his tireless campaigns, speeches, writings and travels, Gandhi managed to instill in the people of India the confidence to fight the British without weapons. “An eye for an eye will make the world go blind,” he said. Gandhi’s methods of passive resistance and his unshakeable faith in the ahimsa way found echoes across the world.The Constitution Of India: Trivia•The Constitution of India is the longest in the world. It comprises more than 1,00,000 words carefully handwritten in English and Hindi, and 271 men and women were part of the constituent assembly that drafted it.•Our constitution has borrowed ideas from other Constitutions and also reworked them to suit our requirements. Among the countries it has borrowed from are the U.K., the U.S., Ireland, Canada, Australia, France.•The preamble begins with the words “We, the people of India...”.•In 2015, the government announced that November 26 would be observed as Constitution Day.•The original Constitution, adopted on January 26 1950, was entirely handcrafted by the artists of Shantiniketan - under the guidance of Acharya Nandalal Bose.

Governor’s failure to act against CM due to Centre’s backing: Stalin

Says protests seeking Edappadi’s removal will continue
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday alleged that the failure of Governor Banwarilal Purohit to take action on the petitions against Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his Cabinet colleagues was proof that the Central government was offering its support to the AIADMK regime.“We will not allow it go on and we will continue to hold protests,” Mr. Stalin told reporters after meeting Chennai district party secretaries who were arrested when they tried to hold a demonstration before the Raj Bhavan seeking a probe into the allegations that Mr. Palaniswami had a role in the 2017 Kodanad Estate break-in.Mr. Stalin said the demonstration was held to bring pressure on Governor Banwarilal Purohit to take action on the DMK’s demands, including removal of Mr. Palaniswami from the Chief Minister post following the recent charges of his involvement in the Kodanad heist and mysterious deaths. “We have sought a probe by a Special Investigation Team. But the Governor has not acted on our demand and we organised the protests to highlight it,” he said.‘GIM a deceit’Mr. Stalin also accused the Chief Minister of converting the Global Investors Meet (GIM) into an election campaign for the AIADMK and seeking to deceive the people of the State with the claim that 304 memorandums of understanding (MoUs) had been signed.“We will know whether these MoUs could be implemented or it is just deceit as done by late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, only after getting a full picture of the event. Even though four years have passed since the first GIM, the government had implemented only 25% of the MoUs signed back then. The GIM is just a gimmick,” he said.In a separate statement, he urged Tamil Nadu Speaker P. Dhanapal to notify the Hosur Assembly constituency as vacant since the Madras High Court had rejected the appeal of former Minister K. Balakrishna Reddy against his conviction in a rioting case."

Cuts diplomatic ties with U.S., orders envoys to leave in 72 hours; Russia, China back government ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro prepared to rally his military supporters on Thursday as the U.S. and key allies backed a challenge from his leading rival who declared himself “acting President”.The announcement by Juan Guaido, 35, head of Venezuela’s Opposition-led legislature, came amid a fresh wave of deadly street clashes on Wednesday. He declared himself acting leader of the oil-rich nation, which has lurched into economic chaos and violence under Mr. Maduro, 56.The Socialist government responded by warning that the top military leadership would come out “in support of the constitutional President”, Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said. He added the military would show “backing for the sovereignty” of Venezuela.Rallying behind GuaidoThat was a warning shot to Mr. Maduro’s foreign critics as they rallied behind Mr. Guaido. U.S. President Donald Trump declared Mr. Maduro “illegitimate” and called the National Assembly legislature “the only legitimate branch of government”.Also ReadJuan Guaido, the man who challenged the Venezuelan PresidentA furious Mr. Maduro broke off diplomatic ties with the “imperialist” U.S. government, giving its diplomats 72 hours to leave. The U.S. State Department said it did not recognise Mr. Maduro as President any more so his order meant nothing. France added its support for Mr. Guaido, also branding Mr. Maduro “illegitimate” and calling for “the restoration of democracy” in Venezuela.Mr. Maduro’s key ally Russia, meanwhile, denounced Mr. Guaido’s bid as a “usurpation” of power and condemned what it called foreign “interference” in Venezuela. “This is a direct path to lawlessness and bloodshed,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Mr. Maduro’s key financial backer China also weighed in. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China opposes “interference” in Venezuelan affairs and called for a “political resolution”.Days of unrestMr. Guaido’s pronouncement capped days of unrest that have seen 13 people killed, the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict said. They were the first mass street protests in Venezuela since a peak of violence in April and July, 2017, when 125 people died in clashes.Riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at Opposition protesters in one Caracas suburb, while television pictures also showed armoured vehicles in the capital. Thousands of Mr. Maduro’s supporters, many wearing red, converged outside the presidential palace, Miraflores, to oppose what they said was a U.S.-backed Opposition coup attempt. Elsewhere in Caracas, tens of thousands of Opposition supporters rallied, dressed in white and waving Venezuelan flags. “Guaido, friend, the people are with you,” they chanted.Mr. Maduro hit back in a speech from a balcony at the presidential palace, lashing out at Mr. Trump. He condemned what he called the U.S. leader’s “extremist policy” as “a very serious folly”. “Trying to impose a government by extra-constitutional means, we cannot accept that.”UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for dialogue to avoid the political crisis spiralling out of control. “What we hope is that dialogue can be possible, and that we avoid an escalation...” he said in Davos."

She planted the saplings in Meerut and surrounding areas inspired by her father and teachers.Like Eiha, 25 more children were awarded the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Tuesday. They achieved remarkable feats in various fields ranging from sports to science and social welfare.The award was earlier known as the National Child Award. It was previously organised by an NGO, the Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW). From this year, the selection of children for the award has been brought under the Women and Child Development (WCD) Ministry.This year, the National Bravery Award was also merged with the Bal Shakti Puraskar which was given away to Kartik Goyal and Adrika Goyal of Madhya Pradesh who showed courage during riots at Morena in April last year and provided food, water, medicine and first aid to the passengers of a train raided by rioters.Each award carries a medal, a cash prize of Rs 1 lakh, book vouchers, a certificate and a citation. According to the WCD Ministry, these children will participate in the Republic Day parade.The Bravery awards were earlier organised by the ICCW. However, following a petition in the Delhi High Court about the NGO misusing the government’s funds, the Centre dissociated itself from the NGO and revamped the scheme of National Awards for children in 2018 to include ‘bravery’ as an additional component in the Pradhan Mantri National Children Awards.

His Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party promises to steady the economy and universal health care, debt relief for farmers and development funds for rural villages.

But the victory is short-lived. His premiership is engulfed by financial scandal and protesters take to the streets.

Athisayakumar, a resident of Thoothukudi, said the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had, under Section 23 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, delegated powers to the State governments to invoke Section 5 of the Act, which included power to give directions such as closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or process. Invoking these powers, the State could close down Sterlite Copper, he said.However, a Division Bench of Justices K.K. Sasidharan and P.D. Audikesavalu observed that the Supreme Court was already hearing the appeal preferred by the State against National Green Tribunal setting aside the closure order.“We refrain from passing any orders in the case,” the court said.The petition was adjourned to February 5 on the question of maintainability.Meanwhile, the court closed a contempt petition filed by K.S. Arjunan, another resident of Thoothukudi, against the CBI after the central investigating agency was accused of not naming anyone in the FIR pertaining to the Thoothukudi riots case.The court observed that the CBI was already conducting an inquiry in the case.The agency cannot name any one just like that while investigation was going on. Closing the contempt petition, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court left it to the petitioner to approach the court at a later stage, if a need arose."

Malik-led administration, the consequences would be “dangerous”.“Unfortunately, under the Governor’s nose, there is selective targeting of Gujjars and Bakerwals in Jammu and the administration is not taking note of it,” Ms. Mehbooba said.The former J&K Chief Minister said that she had raised the matter with the Governor after some houses of Gujjars and Bakerwals were “selectively” served eviction notices in the name of encroachment immediately after the PDP-BJP government in the State collapsed in June last year.“The Governor gave me an assurance that those (houses) will not be touched, especially in the winter months. (But) they are being harassed in the name of encroachment and also in the name of bovine smuggling,” she said.Ms. Mehbooba also alleged that the Muslims living in the Jammu region were being threatened of a 1947-like situation, when communal riots had taken place."

Sharma and Parminder Rai from the 1982 batch — the senior-most officers but lacking in experience in the CBI.Mr. Rai, a Haryana-cadre officer who is set to retire on January 31, 2019, is Director-General, State Vigilance Bureau, which makes him eligible, the officials said.Rina Mitra, Special Secretary (Internal Security), Home Ministry, of the 1983 batch, is another contender. She has served in the CBI for five years and had a long tenure in Madhya Pradesh State vigilance where she handled serious corruption cases. If chosen, she would be the first woman chief of the CBI.The current chief of the National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Sciences, Javeed Ahmed, a 1984-batch IPS officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre, has served the CBI for 13 years — starting as an SP to the Deputy Inspector-General from 1994 to 2002 and as Joint Director from 2009 to 2014, officials said. However, Mr. Ahmed could not be promoted to the post of Additional Director as the then Home Secretary Anil Goswami did not clear the empanelment file of the entire 1984-batch IPS officers till his term came to an end, they said.Next to Mr. Ahmed in terms of experience is O.P. Galhotra, former Rajasthan Director-General of Police, who has served in the agency for 11 years — as an SP from 1996 to 2000 and as a Joint Director from 2008 to 2015, the officials said.Director-General, National Investigation Agency, Y.C. Modi, a 1984-batch IPS officer of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre, is seen as a favourite in the race to the top post.Mr. Modi was a member of the Supreme Court-appointed SIT probing the 2002 Gujarat riots from 2010 to 2012. The SIT had cleared Narendra Modi who was then the Chief Minister. He was also part of the CBI team investigating the murder of former Gujarat Home Minister Haren Pandya and arrested 12 accused.

They were told that it was Thaslim who had roped in Saifi who further involved Riyazuddin in the alleged plan.Police claimed that Saifi who is married and has three children deals in sale and purchase of old cars.He got in touch with Thaslim in 2016 in Dubai and has come to India a few times on medical and tourist visa.“This time he came to India in December, 2018, on a tourist Visa. He came in contact with Riyajuddin through one Abdulla, an Afghan, who was lodged in Tihar Jail in a murder case and was released on bail in 2017,” Mr. Kushwah said adding that the other two are married too and Riyazudin works as a welder.Police claimed that Thaslim went to Dubai inn 1999 and started a liquor business there. “He is previously involved in eight criminal cases including that of rioting, assault and obtaining Passport on forged documents,” the officer said.Police claimed to have recovered two pistols, six live cartridges and mobile phones from their possession."

He adjourned the matter to February 6 after the police said sanction would be obtained within 10 days.Under Section 196 of the Criminal Procedure Code, “no court shall take cognisance of any offence punishable under Chapter VI of the IPC.” Section 124-A (sedition), under which the accused persons have also been chargesheeted, is placed under this chapter.However, criminal lawyer Ashish Dikshit is of the view that it is not mandatory to file chargesheets in such cases without the prosecution sanction. The Central Bureau of Investigation and the Delhi police had on a number of occasions in the past filed chargesheets without approval for prosecution and submitted sanction letters to the courts later, he further said.Shedding more light on the necessity of prosecution sanction, former Standing Counsel of the Delhi Government K.C. Mittal said the court shall not move further so far as the sedition charge is concerned as Section 196 specifically says that cognisance of the offence cannot be taken without sanction.Accused studentsThe other accused persons whom the probe agency chargesheeted on January 14 are former JNU students Syed Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya and Aqueed Hussain, Basharat Ali, Mujeeb Hussain Gattoo, Umair Gul, Muneeb Hussain Gatoo, Rayees Rasool and Khalid Bashir Bhat hailing from Kashmir.They have all been chargesheeted under 124A (sedition), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt, 465 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine forged document), 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 149 (unlawful assembly with common object), 147 (rioting), and 120B (criminal conspiracy)."

Glistening at a distance are warm yellow lights attached to two wooden bullock-cart wheels suspended from the ceiling.The hotel’s interiors are a blend of contemporary architecture decked with traditional décor. The monotony of white walls is broken by brightly coloured doors. Choosing vibrant shades of blue, green, yellow and pink, the doors are in sync with the artworks inside.The 24-room seaside property is divided into four wings. Each wing is dedicated to one traditional art form from the State, namelyEtikoppaka, Budithi brassware,tholu bommalata(leather puppetry) andkalamkari.Over 30 artisans from Visakhapatnam have worked for over a year to create 70 sculptures and 50 art installations for the hotel. Every room has a customised headboard, study table and wardrobe that are designed following the art form.“While the planning and implementation took us over a year, it was the research about these art forms that took three to four years. The idea for the hotel is inspired by Le Sutra, an Indian Art hotel that is a sister concern of Palm Beach Hotel.Le Sutra is designed on threegunas— Tamas, Rajas and Sattva — that feature in Indian mythology,” says Ameet Mirpuri, a Visakhapatnam-based interior designer for Andhra Art and Craft Hotel.Started with an aim to familiarise people with the traditional art forms of the State, the team chose four art forms that have been part of Andhra culture for decades.Etikoppakacomes from a village of the same name situated in Visakhapatnam district. The village is renowned for its craftsmanship in making wooden toys from a locally-grown tree, Ankudu. Rooms designed according to this art form have aPandiri Mancham, an Andhra-style bed with a headboard that has wooden carvings used to makeEtikoppakatoys. “Traditionally, the artisans use natural dyes made with seeds, bark, lacquer, leaves and roots. In keeping with this, theEtikoppakamurals that we have in the rooms also are coloured with natural dyes,” says Ameet.The rooms themed around Budithi brass work have headboards inspired from sculptures of women adorned with jewellery, commonly seen in the carvings of local temples. Drawing inspiration from theUyala(swing) found in old houses, the sofas in these rooms have meticulously-carved brass chains replicating the swings.Taking visitors on a creative tour of the underwater world are the rooms designed withkalamkaripaintings. Headboards here are a splash of bright colour, painting ocean-related scenes using traditional motifs like leaves and flowers.Explaining the idea behind choosing the ocean theme, Srinivasa Rao Kanumari, the artist who made the paintings, says, “Usually,kalamkaripaintings draw heavily from mythology. However, since this project was about an innovative take on traditional artforms, I took the creative liberty to paint quirky scenes like a man taking a whale on a walk or a shark blowing a trumpet.”He adds that going beyond the conventional reds, greens and blacks used forkalamakari, he used vibrant colours like blue, turquoise green and yellow. It took him six months to paint the six paintings displayed in the rooms.The rooms that are inspired bytholu bommalatahave been designed to create a local fair, as traditionally this puppetry was widely seen in these fairs. The headboards have huge leather puppets against a painted backdrop. The sofas in these rooms remind you of soda carts with colourful glasses and stationary wheels attached to them.However, it is not just the rooms that display the State’s rich art forms. Even the room numbers have been customised to stand up to the tag of an art and craft hotel. The numbers and alphabets used on the plates have been specially created by art graduate Krupanand Kartik, who used an amalgamation of English numericals and alphabets with graphics inspired from temple architecture. The hotel is surrounded by garden lined with wall murals.Rooms in the heritage wing are priced higher than the other rooms in Palm Beach Hotel.

They were told that it was Thaslim who had roped in Saifi who further involved Riyazuddin in the alleged plan.Police claimed that Saifi who is married and has three children deals in sale and purchase of old cars.He got in touch with Thaslim in 2016 in Dubai and has come to India a few times on medical and tourist visa.“This time he came to India in December, 2018, on a tourist Visa. He came in contact with Riyajuddin through one Abdulla, an Afghan, who was lodged in Tihar Jail in a murder case and was released on bail in 2017,” Mr. Kushwah said adding that the other two are married too and Riyazudin works as a welder.Police claimed that Thaslim went to Dubai inn 1999 and started a liquor business there. “He is previously involved in eight criminal cases including that of rioting, assault and obtaining Passport on forged documents,” the officer said.Police claimed to have recovered two pistols, six live cartridges and mobile phones from their possession."

",,"The State police have sought punitive action against eight government service organisation leaders suspected to be responsible for the attack on the Treasury branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) next door to the Secretariat on the second day of the national strike by trade unions on January 9.Sub-Inspector, Cantonment, B.M. Shafi said here on Friday that the police had written to the department heads detailing the involvement of the suspects in the crime for further action.The police had earlier booked the trade union functionaries, all owing allegiance to the Kerala NGO Union, on charges of having damaged public property and indulged in rioting.The offence carries a punishment of up to five years of imprisonment and fine or both.If found guilty, the suspects run the risk of dismissal from service.The government has since suspended these persons from service pending inquiry.Bail plea rejectedThe Judicial First Class Magistrate (JFMC) court here rejected the bail application of the accused. Their lawyers said the accused would move the district court for relief.The police had relied on “smoking gun” video footage from the bank’s security cameras to identify the accused.Regardless of the massive police presence in the high-security locality, a set of trade unionists had sauntered into the bank, intimidated staff and destroyed office equipment wantonly.The images, broadcast widely on television, had a salutary effect across Kerala and deterred shops and establishments from opening for business on the day of the general strike. The police said the suspects had smashed an office computer, manhandled the manager and vandalised furniture. They pegged the loss to the exchequer at Rs. 1.50 lakh."

Every room has a customised headboard, study table and wardrobe that are designed following the art form.“While the planning and implementation took us over a year, it was the research about these art forms that took three to four years. The idea for the hotel is inspired by Le Sutra, an Indian Art hotel that is a sister concern of Palm Beach Hotel.Le Sutra is designed on threegunas— Tamas, Rajas and Sattva — that feature in Indian mythology,” says Ameet Mirpuri, a Visakhapatnam-based interior designer for Andhra Art and Craft Hotel.Started with an aim to familiarise people with the traditional art forms of the State, the team chose four art forms that have been part of Andhra culture for decades.Etikoppakacomes from a village of the same name situated in Visakhapatnam district. The village is renowned for its craftsmanship in making wooden toys from a locally-grown tree, Ankudu. Rooms designed according to this art form have aPandiri Mancham, an Andhra-style bed with a headboard that has wooden carvings used to makeEtikoppakatoys. “Traditionally, the artisans use natural dyes made with seeds, bark, lacquer, leaves and roots. In keeping with this, theEtikoppakamurals that we have in the rooms also are coloured with natural dyes,” says Ameet.The rooms themed around Budithi brass work have headboards inspired from sculptures of women adorned with jewellery, commonly seen in the carvings of local temples.

However, since this project was about an innovative take on traditional artforms, I took the creative liberty to paint quirky scenes like a man taking a whale on a walk or a shark blowing a trumpet.”He adds that going beyond the conventional reds, greens and blacks used forkalamakari, he used vibrant colours like blue, turquoise green and yellow.

Manja Virattu celebrated amidst riot of colour ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/manja-virattu-celebrated-amidst-riot-of-colour/article26019303.ece,"
Bulls sprinting through the Kuilapalayam lanes a big draw ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Kuilapalayam, a non-descript village near Auroville, came alive to the sound of colourfully-decorated bulls sprinting through its streets as part of the Manja Virattu celebrations.Foreign tourists present at the venue got a taste of a tradition of rural Tamil Nadu.Manja Virattu, hosted by this hamlet for over six decades, served as a grand finale for the three-day Pongal festivities for the villagers. The event was a huge tourist draw. Unlike Jallikattu, Manja Virattu does not involve taming the bulls.It all started with a puja at the local Pidariamman temple. The deity was taken in a procession near the temple, where bulls, cows and calves from surrounding 22 villages decorated with balloons, bananas and posters of actors, were lined up for the race. The bulls were let loose. Egged on by a boisterous crowd, the bulls sprinted through the streets of the village. People, including a large number of foreigners, cheered the animals on both sides of the route. Some were seen capturing the moments in their camera.‘Fantastic, unbelievable’For Anna and her husband Larz from Sweden, it was an off-beat cultural event with the cows beautifully decorated.“We took our grandchildren from Moscow on the way to India. This is our first visit to Auroville. The cattle races are fantastic and unbelievable. There is so much to see and we will be back next year,” Ms. Anna said.Dr. Justin Lawson and Sarra from Deakin University in Australia termed the event as full of fun. “We have been here for the past three days and it is an amazing experience. We have never seen anything like this before. The cows were beautifully decorated and break into a run at the bursting of crackers. There is so much of colour, vibrancy and it is an amazing thing to see,” Mr. Lawson said. “Normally, hundreds of bulls and cows would take part in the event. But the the number of cattle has dwindled over the last few years due to decline in farming activities and now even calves take part in the event,” said a resident."

Association condemns assault on retired DSP

The Association had also sent a representation to the ADGP
",,"The district chapter of the Tamil Nadu Retired PoliceOfficers’ Welfare Association has alleged inaction by the police on the assault and eviction of retired DSP in Hosur by his daughter and son-in-law.The assault on the 80-year-old M. A. Dhanraj, formerly credited with fighting the Naxals in the 80s in Thiruvannamalai, has not gone down well with the retired policemen’s association here that have alleged ‘indifference on the part of the police’.The police have not even invoked 506 (Section 506 IPC for criminal intimidation) for the assault on a senior citizen, says Pichai, district coordinator of the association.On Monday, Mr. Dhanraj was thrown out of the apartment by his daughter, her husband and a few ‘contracted’ men.Video goes viralHe was dropped on the street pavement. All this was captured on a phone and the video went viral.“Among the things that were thrown out on that day was a framed photograph of Mr. Dhanraj being felicitated by former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran for his fight against the Naxals alongside Walter Devaram,” says Mr. Pichai.President’s medalHe also won the President’s medal and a stupa with his name DSP M.A. Dhanraj along with Mr. Devaram is erected at the town police station in Tiruvannamalai,” claims Mr. Pichai. After a father-daughter relationship went sour, Mr. Dhanraj ‘cancelled’ a gift deed of a plot he had given to his daughter Dhanalakshmi in 2007.Dhanalakshmi and her husband Balamurali, both residing in the United States, had raised a five-story apartment complex on the plot over the years. In 2018, Mr. Dhanraj ‘cancelled’ the gift deed inked a decade ago, and also managed to register the same at Hosur Sub-Registrar’s office.Disputed propertyHe also took possession of the room downstairs and put up a board stating that it was a disputed property. However, the High Court, on a writ filed, declared the cancellation of the deed null and void.Soon after, early January 2019, Dhanalakshmi made a gift settlement of the property in favour of her husband Balamurali, who is Dhanraj’s’ sister’s son.The Association had also sent a representation to the ADGP (Law and Order) M. Ravi demanding action against the Hosur Hudco police for treating a civil dispute as a criminal dispute. “They did not invoke strong sections for the assault on Mr. Dhanraj. But the Hudco police had filed FIRs on his daughter’s complaint invoking 506,” he says referring to earlier criminal complaints lodged by his daughter against her father in November 2018, and based on which FIR was registered under Section 506 IPC among other sections.Civil suiteIn the police copy of the case, available withThe Hindu, since the writ only speaks about the cancellation of the settlement deed, Mr. Balamurali can only file a civil suit to vacate a senior citizen of 80 years old.For the assault on the retired policeman, FIR was filed under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 448 (house trespass), 336 (endangering life or personal safety),380 (theft in any building) were imposed against Dhanalakshmi, Balamurali, and 10 others.Family dispute“A case has been registered under simple assault and trespass. There is no particular section for assault on a senior citizen. It’s a family dispute, we have asked them to sit and talk it through,” says Superintendent of Police Bandi Gangadhar."

With the police deployed in full strength, it was well protected. Bulls that came charging from the vaadivaasal were efficiently handled by their owners at this end point.Members of the organising committee and the police had an altercation at the arena during play. When the police used lathis to beat a miscreant owner who tried to taunt his bull, the organising committee intervened and asked him to use force. The SP said that the police would not take instructions from them.Bull owners and tamers were showered with prizes that came with tags of political parties. Malayandi, a member of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, offered a prize of Rs. 5,000 for the best bull or tamer of the round. The bull fended off competitors with ease and was a contender for the best bull prize.The organising committee often made jokes at the expense of tamers who were “too afraid” to tame fierce bulls. Four bulls from Pudukkottai, which belong to Health Minister C. Vijaya Bhaskar, beat all the tamers without much ado. The bulls also engaged with the players, making it attractive for viewers."

#Festival to celebrate humour

You can laugh with seven live comics at ‘Laugh Ok Please’ presented by Evam Stand-up Tamasha and ‘The Hindu’
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"This weekend is a test for your appetite for humour. Seven stand up comics get on stage to share memories, anecdotes, quirks and of course laughter at the ‘Laugh Ok Please’ up show hosted by Evam Stand-up Tamasha andThe Hindu. A first-of-its kind South Indian comedy festival will be held across four cities — Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Coimbatore. Festival director Vasanth Subramaniam shares that more than 40 comics are part of the festival. “The speciality is all these live comics will be performing in the cities on this weekend only.”The intent to celebrate humour in the Sankranti week is to continue the cheer and warmth. “Stand-up is a craze in India right now. People love to watch live shows because it is pure entertainment. It is more bang for buck,” enthuses Vasanth. The idea is to have a show where Delhi and Mumbai-based comics present their latest content to their south Indian audiences and also have a local flavour with city-based comics. “The audience will have a fun riot with this blend.” The 70-minute Hyderabad show has Chennai-based Jagan Krishnan, Praveen Kumar and Vikash Paul, Daniel Fernandes, Anuradha Menon (Lola Kutty) and our own Rajasekhar Mamidanna and Vivek Muralidhran presenting a 8-12 minute act. While different artistes will be hosting the shows across the cities, some comics travel a bit Zakir Khan will be participating in Chennai and Coimbatore and Daniel Fernandes, who performs in Hyderabad is also part of Bengaluru line-up.Stand up comedy scene has been on an upward swing, with comics using humour as a tool to speak on anything and everything under the sun. This is one of the contributing factors for its success. “It is being used to comment on real life, politics, diverse people, and sensitive topics. Since its down with humour, it allows you to be candid and hence it becomes a talking point. This cannot be done in films because of censorship or on television due to branding/advertisements,” Vasanth elaborates, asserting that stand-up scene is far from hitting the saturation button in the country. “Look at the new artists being discovered every day. The number of people watching these live shows has steadily gone up, number of fans following specific comedians has steadily gone up.”The frequency of stand-up shows has seen a rise in Hyderabad too but looks like we still have a lot of catching up to do. “The open mic sessions and pub shows are more in Chennai and Bengaluru,” shares Vasanth. That is also one of the reasons that these two cities and Coimbatore have a two-day comedy festival while Hyderabad gets only one day.With hopes to target the right kind of audience, there are plans to make this comedy festival, an annual event.(Evam and The Hindu presents Laugh OK Please, at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan on January 19; 7 pm.

Manja Virattu celebrated amidst riot of colour

Bulls sprinting through the Kuilapalayam lanes a big draw
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Kuilapalayam, a non-descript village near Auroville, came alive to the sound of colourfully-decorated bulls sprinting through its streets as part of the Manja Virattu celebrations.Foreign tourists present at the venue got a taste of a tradition of rural Tamil Nadu.Manja Virattu, hosted by this hamlet for over six decades, served as a grand finale for the three-day Pongal festivities for the villagers. The event was a huge tourist draw. Unlike Jallikattu, Manja Virattu does not involve taming the bulls.It all started with a puja at the local Pidariamman temple. The deity was taken in a procession near the temple, where bulls, cows and calves from surrounding 22 villages decorated with balloons, bananas and posters of actors, were lined up for the race. The bulls were let loose. Egged on by a boisterous crowd, the bulls sprinted through the streets of the village. People, including a large number of foreigners, cheered the animals on both sides of the route. Some were seen capturing the moments in their camera.‘Fantastic, unbelievable’For Anna and her husband Larz from Sweden, it was an off-beat cultural event with the cows beautifully decorated.“We took our grandchildren from Moscow on the way to India. This is our first visit to Auroville. The cattle races are fantastic and unbelievable. There is so much to see and we will be back next year,” Ms. Anna said.Dr. Justin Lawson and Sarra from Deakin University in Australia termed the event as full of fun. “We have been here for the past three days and it is an amazing experience. We have never seen anything like this before. The cows were beautifully decorated and break into a run at the bursting of crackers. There is so much of colour, vibrancy and it is an amazing thing to see,” Mr. Lawson said. “Normally, hundreds of bulls and cows would take part in the event. But the the number of cattle has dwindled over the last few years due to decline in farming activities and now even calves take part in the event,” said a resident."

At the birth centenary celebrations of Lala Charat Ram, a well-conceived ensemble led by Ustad Zakir Hussain mesmerised the Delhi audience
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"No piece of music can be considered complete without the able accompaniment of a right percussion instrument. The Indian musical landscape has been enriched with percussion instruments like tabla, dhol, pakhawaj, mridangam, khol, ghatam, khanjira et al. Unfortunately, the percussionist was relegated to the background in past. Musicians like Pt. Ravi Shankar and the artistry of percussionists like Ud. Alla Rakha reached the percussion support to its deserved status and the spotlight is now shining bright on the percussionists. So much so that to celebrate the birth centenary of its founder chairman Lala Charat Ram, Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra (SBKK) presented one of his favourite artistes, Ustad Zakir Hussain in concert at the Kamani auditorium.The special concert had a special floral décor on the stage to greet Zakir who entered most unassumingly amongst thunderous applause. “This concert is not just mine. The transmission of knowledge now is not confined to the family only but has crossed international boundaries. I am just one of them and each one of them is a big star. It's a collective effort.” Introducing them all, he invited Sabir Khan to open the evening with his sonorous sarangi to create the appropriate atmosphere and the right mood. The others, he said, would join as and when they felt like it, because it was an open ended concert.The most significant feature of the concert was of course Zakir’s tabla solo with a clear air-brushed tone and technical flair that was striking in its training and innate understanding of rhythm and phrasing. Sabir Khan had played a quality delicate and detailed alaap of raga Saraswati in which he played the lehera (the musical refrain) for the tabla solo by Zakir in Teentala. The pregnant pauses of Sabir’s sarangi had meanings that evoked a lot of expectations from Zakir who opened with a detailed alaap like peshkara that started inbarabar ki laya,that is at the same pace and tempo in which Sabir provided the lehera, with a kind of taut tension andvazanthat reciprocated even the pauses of sarangi. The elongated initial round of the peshkara itself heralded a loud round of applause.Then came the Dilli ka Quayeda, which was reversed by Ud. Habibuddin Khan of Meerut keeping the Tir kit ahead. It was followed by the “Dhir Dhir kit tak...” of Benaras and the delicacies of many different styles. The technical virtuosity of Zakir kept the scale and proportion with strikingly intricate layakaris that pirouetted on the rhythm with quiet aplomb.Zakir gradually turned his concert into an ensemble of remarkable appeal. The well-conceived and competently-coordinated ensemble comprised Ananth R Krishnan, the grandson and disciple of Vidwan Palghat Raghu on the mridangam, Nitin Sharma on dholak and Sabir Khan on sarangi. Nitin has studied under Ud. Allah Rakha Khan and has played with diverse genres from Jazz, Pop, Rock and Fusion to Ghazal and Bhajan ensembles. Sabir is the son and disciple of Ud. Sultan Khan, the real sultan of sarangi. When Zakir reached the medium tempo in Teentala, he was joined by Nitin on Dholak. Nitin could reciprocate with effortless ease to all the rela-paltas of Zakir since they both learnt from the same Guru Ud. Alla Rakha Khan. They played alternately and together, when they came on a thunderous ‘sam’ after a chakkardar tihai.Soothing sarangiAnanth Krishnan joined them last with his totally tuneful and lyrical mridangam. His expertise was best showcased in the intricate work of Misra Jati.All three of them took turn gradually going faster in drut laya (faster tempo) and played the choicest of farmaishi tihai comprising one Dha, two Dha and three Dhas respectively in the three repetitions of the same mnemonics or bols that form the tihai and the bedum tihai that doesn’t even leave space for a breath, before reaching together the ultimate Sam. Although all three percussionists were masters of their specific instruments, the only problem was with the dholak, that did not sound as accurately drenched in ´sur´ as the tabla and mridangam did.The melodious interludes of sarangi came as a cooling respite in between the fireworks ignited by the percussion ensemble. Sabir, in fact, was the soul of the whole ensemble and Zakir utilised his full potential right from the beginning, even before he opened his tabla Solo, when he invited him to play the initial alaap in raga Saraswati, establishing the musical refrain for his solo in Teentala.The ensemble’s climax was a riot of wit and virtuosity. They should have stopped at this zenith only, because the following ghoomar, the Rajasthani folk song sung by Sabir Khan could not match and maintain the total tunefulness of his sarangi and marred the well built climax. Singing does not come with sarangi as ‘buy one get one free’. You have to work on your voice as you do on sarangi.Ultimately, it was not just the charisma but also the command of Zakir´s hypnotising art, that the jam-packed hall sat rapped and absorbed throughout the mesmerising evening."

Inquiries indicate intention was only to sell them; NCP seeks CM’s clarification
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Thane Crime Branch arrested a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker after a large cache of weapons was found in his shop in Dombivali on Tuesday.According to the police, the accused has been identified as Dhanajay Kulkarni (49), a resident of New Deep Jyot building in Tilak Nagar, Dombivali (east). Mr. Kulkarni was arrested after the Kalyan unit of the Thane Crime Branch received a tip-off that he was storing and selling weapons in a garment store owned by him in Arihant Building in Tilak Nagar.“A raid was conducted at Tapasya House Of Fashion on Tuesday evening. A total of 170 weapons, including swords, daggers, switchblades, air guns, and kukris (Nepalil daggers with curved blades), collectively worth ₹1.86 lakh, were seized from the shop,” Thane Police spokesperson police inspector Sukhada Narkar said.Mr. Kulkarni was arrested and charged under the Arms Act. “We have found out that Mr. Kulkarni had obtained the weapons from Crawford Market in Mumbai. Inquiries till now indicate that the intention was only to sell them, and not to use them for crime. We are in the process of identifying the source and the people who have bought weapons from Mr. Kulkarni so that they can be apprehended,” an officer who is part of the investigation said.While the police refused to comment on Mr. Kulkarni’s political affiliations, sources said he is a vice president level functionary with the BJP.Mr. Kulkarni’s arrest sparked reactions from political parties. In a statement on Wednesday, Nationalist Congress Party State president Jayant Patil said, “It is apparent exactly how the BJP intends to run the nation in the days to come. What riots were being planned with the use of these weapons? Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis should issue a clarification on this. If party vice presidents are being caught with illegal arms, there is no need for criminals or terrorists.”Meanwhile, in another operation, the Unit V of the Thane Crime Branch arrested a history-sheeter and seized a factory-made pistol and two live rounds from him last week. The police said the accused, Sunny Rathod, was arrested in Majiwada of Thane on January 12. A local criminal with cases like extortion and assault registered against him, Mr. Rathod has been externed from the Mumbai city limits, officers said."

Party’s ‘anti-Sikh’ face exposed, say AAP and BJP
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Congress was criticised by Opposition parties on Wednesday for giving senior leader Jagdish Tytler who was allegedly involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots a seat on the dais.The BJP and AAP both termed Mr. Tytler’s presence on the front row at a function organised to welcome Sheila Dikshit as president of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee as the “anti-Sikh” face of the party.Threaten witnessesShiromani Akali Dal MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa said that party had ensured Mr. Tytler’s prominent presence only to threaten witness of the 1984 Sikh genocide cases and to stop them from deposing against the accused in the cases.“After the conviction of Sajjan Kumar, the Congress has gone berserk. In desperation to save the skin of its leaders whom it had deputed to carry out the 1984 Sikh carnage, it is going all out to show its power to the families of victims and witnesses. The Congress was afraid as it was aware that [Jagdish] Tytler and Kamal Nath would also be jailed in cases related to the anti-Sikh riots,” Mr. Sirsa said.The AAP said that the prominent presence of one of the “main perpetrators” of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in a public function organised by Congress exposes the real face of this party.“Tytler had to resign from the Union Cabinet in 2005 after being named in the Nanavati Commission report. Further his Lok Sabha ticket had to be withdrawn in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress tried its level best to save him by misusing the CBI. It is a shame that such riot masterminds are today the faces of Congress in Delhi,” said AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh.Commenting on Mr. Tytler’s presence, Delhi’s BJP chief Manoj Tiwari felt that the demand to withdraw the Bharat Ratna from Rajiv Gandhi should be pursued swiftly by Arvind Kejriwal as it has now become clear that the Congress is against the Sikhs and wants to justify the 1984 riots. “If Mr. Kejriwal does not, it will become clear that he wants to go along with the Sheila [Dikshit] group,” Mr. Tiwari said.Responding to criticism, Mr. Tytler told reporters that those objecting to his presence should show if there is any FIR against him. “The CBI has cleared my name. There is no FIR against me. I was one among thousands who had come to attend the function,” Mr. Tytler said. Ms. Dikshit also supported him by saying that Mr. Tytler was a Congressman and the party had not shunted him out."

Dalit groups incensed at relief for Milind Ekbote

To challenge relaxation of bail conditions in High Court
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Dalit outfits are irked at a Pune court’s decision to grant relief to Hindutva leader Milind Ekbote, who is accused of orchestrating the Bhima-Koregaon clashes on January 1 last year.FIRs had been lodged on January 2, 2018 against Mr. Ekbote, who heads Samasta Hindu Aghadi, and Sambhaji Bhide, founder of the Sangli-based right-wing group, Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan.On Monday, the court lifted restrictions on Mr. Ekbote holding public rallies, speaking to the media and making mandatory appearances at the Shikrapur police station. In a bid to quash the relief, the Republican Yuva Morcha is planning to move the Bombay High Court. Meanwhile, the Ramdas Athawale-led RPI (A), an ally of the BJP, has accused the Home Department of covertly backing Mr. Ekbote.‘Going soft on accused’RPI (A) leader Siddharth Dhende accused the Pune police of deliberately “going soft” on Mr. Ekbote and failing to make a strong case against him despite ample evidence. Mr. Dhende said, “It is ironic that the Pune police are overzealous about prosecuting an eminent writer, educationist and civil rights activist like Anand Teltumbde, who is not remotely connected with the Bhima-Koregaon clashes. Yet, they fail to make a case against Mr. Ekbote, the chief instigator of the riots. The police’s slipshod probe has led the court to relax the stringent conditions.”Mr. Dhende said the police’s soft-pedaling of a habitual offender like Mr. Ekbote could only imply “pressure from above”. He said Mr. Ekbote would now ratchet up tensions at Bhima-Koregaon and its neighbouring villages, and threaten witnesses to the January 1 violence. Mr. Dhende said, “Our party president, Mr. Ramdas Athawale will speak to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on re-imposing controls and checks on Mr. Ekbote.”Rahul Dambale, State president of the Republican Yuva Morcha, said if Mr. Ekbote was ‘innocent’, then why did the Pune rural police issue prohibitory orders against him on the eve of the 201st anniversary of the Bhima- Koregaon battle this year. Mr. Dambale said, “The least the Pune police could have done was to present a strong case before the court to maintain the conditions of Mr. Ekbote’s bail till he was chargesheeted. This clearly proves that the authorities are being pressured by the State government and the Home Department.”He said in October 2001, when Mr. Ekbote came under the police scanner after a riot in Saswad, top district authorities mulled action against him under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug-Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act, 1981.‘Infamous for rioting’Mr. Dambale said, “Mr. Ekbote, who was notorious even then for aggravating social tensions, narrowly evaded arrest in 2001 only by the reported intervention of a person no less than senior BJP leader L.K. Advani, who was the then Union Minister for Home Affairs.”He said since then, Mr. Ekbote has been embroiled in at least 27 cases of rioting. Mr. Dambale said, “Our outfit is going to challenge the ‘relaxation’ in the Bombay High Court. We demand that he [Mr. Ekbote] be prosecuted under the MPDA Act.”Anita Ravindra Salve, a member of the Bahujan Republican Socialist Party, and Anjana Gaikwad had filed an FIR in Pimpri-Chinchwad against Mr. Bhide and Mr. Ekbote. The Shikrapur police had also lodged a case against Mr. Ekbote under Section 307 (attempt to murder) under the Indian Penal Code, and relevant sections of the Maharashtra Property Damage Act. While Mr. Bhide has never been questioned in connection with the clashes, Mr. Ekbote was granted conditional bail in April last year."

A riot of art forms

Andhra Art and Craft Hotel in Visakhapatnam offers its guests a taste of the State’s traditions from the comfort of their rooms
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A large imposing mural of Telugu Thalli welcomes visitors to the newly-opened heritage wing of Palm Beach Hotel, named Andhra Art and Craft Hotel. With akalasamin her right hand and harvest crop in her left, the mural signifies the prosperity of the Telugu lands. Glistening at a distance are warm yellow lights attached to two wooden bullock-cart wheels suspended from the ceiling. The hotel’s interiors are a blend of contemporary architecture decked with traditional décor.The monotony of white walls is broken by brightly coloured doors. Choosing vibrant shades of blue, green, yellow and pink, the doors are in sync with the artworks inside.The 24-room seaside property is divided into four wings. Each wing is dedicated to one traditional art form from the State, namelyEtikoppaka, Budithi brassware,tholu bommalata(leather puppetry) andkalamkari.Over 30 artisans from Visakhapatnam have worked for over a year to create 70 sculptures and 50 art installations for the hotel. Every room has a customised headboard, study table and wardrobe that are designed following the art form.“While the planning and implementation took us over a year, it was the research about these art forms that took three to four years. The idea for the hotel is inspired by Le Sutra, an Indian Art hotel that is a sister concern of Palm Beach Hotel.Le Sutra is designed on threegunas— Tamas, Rajas and Sattva — that feature in Indian mythology,” says Ameet Mirpuri, a Visakhapatnam-based interior designer for Andhra Art and Craft Hotel. Started with an aim to familiarise people with the traditional art forms of the State, the team chose four art forms that have been part of Andhra culture for decades.Etikoppakacomes from a village of the same name situated in Visakhapatnam district. The village is renowned for its craftsmanship in making wooden toys from a locally-grown tree, Ankudu. Rooms designed according to this art form have aPandiri Mancham, an Andhra-style bed with a headboard that has wooden carvings used to makeEtikoppakatoys. “Traditionally, the artisans use natural dyes made with seeds, bark, lacquer, leaves and roots.In keeping with this, theEtikoppakamurals that we have in the rooms also are coloured with natural dyes,” says Ameet. The rooms themed around Budithi brass work have headboards inspired from sculptures of women adorned with jewellery, commonly seen in the carvings of local temples. Drawing inspiration from theUyala(swing) found in old houses, the sofas in these rooms have meticulously-carved brass chains replicating the swings.Taking visitors on a creative tour of the underwater world are the rooms designed withkalamkaripaintings. Headboards here are a splash of bright colour, painting ocean-related scenes using traditional motifs like leaves and flowers.Explaining the idea behind choosing the ocean theme, Srinivasa Rao Kanumari, the artist who made the paintings, says, “Usually,kalamkaripaintings draw heavily from mythology. However, since this project was about an innovative take on traditional artforms, I took the creative liberty to paint quirky scenes like a man taking a whale on a walk or a shark blowing a trumpet.”He adds that going beyond the conventional reds, greens and blacks used forkalamakari, he used vibrant colours like blue, turquoise green and yellow. It took him six months to paint the six paintings displayed in the rooms. The rooms that are inspired bytholu bommalatahave been designed to create a local fair, as traditionally this puppetry was widely seen in these fairs. The headboards have huge leather puppets against a painted backdrop. The sofas in these rooms remind you of soda carts with colourful glasses and stationary wheels attached to them.However, it is not just the rooms that display the State’s rich art forms. Even the room numbers have been customised to stand up to the tag of an art and craft hotel.The numbers and alphabets used on the plates have been specially created by art graduate Krupanand Kartik, who used an amalgamation of English numericals and alphabets with graphics inspired from temple architecture. The hotel is surrounded by garden lined with wall murals.Rooms in the heritage wing are priced higher than the other rooms in Palm Beach Hotel. Spending a night in the company of these artworks will cost you around Rs. 7,500. As an added incentive, you can get a quick class on each art form and its origin from the hotel staff, who have been trained to educate guests."

Modi desperate to cling on to power: BKC
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/modi-desperate-to-cling-on-to-power-bkc/article26009642.ece,,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP’s national president Amit Shah are “desperate” to cling on to power after the coming Lok Sabha elections to keep the ghosts of Godhra riots and fake encounters at bay, the former Minister B.K. Chandrashekar has said.Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, Mr. Chandrashekar, who is also a vice-president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, said Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah “desperately” need to remain in power to escape the long arms of law in the Godhra riots and fake encounter cases, he said.The ploy to topple the H.D. Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in Karnataka figures in their larger scheme of things to return to power at the Centre after the Lok Sabha elections, he said, and claimed that the alleged horse-trading was sanctioned by Mr. Modi himself.“They know that winning 15 to 20 seats in Karnataka is crucial for their bid to return to power,” he said, and added that the BJP was hoping to go to the Lok Sabha polls with a BJP government in Karnataka to achieve the goal.Mr. Modi’s announcement on 10% reservation for the economically weaker sections in employment and education, besides the revision in the Goods and Sales Tax (GST) slabs were part of the baits the government was hanging in front of the people after the party’s rout in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh Assembly elections.He said a good portion of the urban youth had moved away from the BJP on account of repeated mob lynching cases and “failure” of the government to keep its promise on providing employment."

Every room has a customised headboard, study table and wardrobe that are designed following the art form.“While the planning and implementation took us over a year, it was the research about these art forms that took three to four years. The idea for the hotel is inspired by Le Sutra, an Indian Art hotel that is a sister concern of Palm Beach Hotel.Le Sutra is designed on threegunas— Tamas, Rajas and Sattva — that feature in Indian mythology,” says Ameet Mirpuri, a Visakhapatnam-based interior designer for Andhra Art and Craft Hotel.Started with an aim to familiarise people with the traditional art forms of the State, the team chose four art forms that have been part of Andhra culture for decades.Etikoppakacomes from a village of the same name situated in Visakhapatnam district. The village is renowned for its craftsmanship in making wooden toys from a locally-grown tree, Ankudu. Rooms designed according to this art form have aPandiri Mancham, an Andhra-style bed with a headboard that has wooden carvings used to makeEtikoppakatoys. “Traditionally, the artisans use natural dyes made with seeds, bark, lacquer, leaves and roots. In keeping with this, theEtikoppakamurals that we have in the rooms also are coloured with natural dyes,” says Ameet.The rooms themed around Budithi brass work have headboards inspired from sculptures of women adorned with jewellery, commonly seen in the carvings of local temples. Drawing inspiration from theUyala(swing) found in old houses, the sofas in these rooms have meticulously-carved brass chains replicating the swings.Taking visitors on a creative tour of the underwater world are the rooms designed withkalamkaripaintings. Headboards here are a splash of bright colour, painting ocean-related scenes using traditional motifs like leaves and flowers.Explaining the idea behind choosing the ocean theme, Srinivasa Rao Kanumari, the artist who made the paintings, says, “Usually,kalamkaripaintings draw heavily from mythology. However, since this project was about an innovative take on traditional artforms, I took the creative liberty to paint quirky scenes like a man taking a whale on a walk or a shark blowing a trumpet.”He adds that going beyond the conventional reds, greens and blacks used forkalamakari, he used vibrant colours like blue, turquoise green and yellow. It took him six months to paint the six paintings displayed in the rooms.The rooms that are inspired bytholu bommalatahave been designed to create a local fair, as traditionally this puppetry was widely seen in these fairs. The headboards have huge leather puppets against a painted backdrop. The sofas in these rooms remind you of soda carts with colourful glasses and stationary wheels attached to them.However, it is not just the rooms that display the State’s rich art forms. Even the room numbers have been customised to stand up to the tag of an art and craft hotel. The numbers and alphabets used on the plates have been specially created by art graduate Krupanand Kartik, who used an amalgamation of English numericals and alphabets with graphics inspired from temple architecture. The hotel is surrounded by garden lined with wall murals.Rooms in the heritage wing are priced higher than the other rooms in Palm Beach Hotel. Spending a night in the company of these artworks will cost you around Rs. 7,500. As an added incentive, you can get a quick class on each art form and its origin from the hotel staff, who have been trained to educate guests."

Inquiries indicate intention was only to sell them; NCP seeks CM’s clarification
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Thane Crime Branch arrested a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker after a large cache of weapons was found in his shop in Dombivali on Tuesday.According to the police, the accused has been identified as Dhanajay Kulkarni (49), a resident of New Deep Jyot building in Tilak Nagar, Dombivali (east). Mr. Kulkarni was arrested after the Kalyan unit of the Thane Crime Branch received a tip-off that he was storing and selling weapons in a garment store owned by him in Arihant Building in Tilak Nagar.“A raid was conducted at Tapasya House Of Fashion on Tuesday evening. A total of 170 weapons, including swords, daggers, switchblades, air guns, and kukris (Nepalil daggers with curved blades), collectively worth Rs. 1.86 lakh, were seized from the shop,” Thane Police spokesperson police inspector Sukhada Narkar said.Mr. Kulkarni was arrested and charged under the Arms Act. “We have found out that Mr. Kulkarni had obtained the weapons from Crawford Market in Mumbai. Inquiries till now indicate that the intention was only to sell them, and not to use them for crime. We are in the process of identifying the source and the people who have bought weapons from Mr. Kulkarni so that they can be apprehended,” an officer who is part of the investigation said.While the police refused to comment on Mr. Kulkarni’s political affiliations, sources said he is a vice president level functionary with the BJP.Mr. Kulkarni’s arrest sparked reactions from political parties. In a statement on Wednesday, Nationalist Congress Party State president Jayant Patil said, “It is apparent exactly how the BJP intends to run the nation in the days to come. What riots were being planned with the use of these weapons? Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis should issue a clarification on this. If party vice presidents are being caught with illegal arms, there is no need for criminals or terrorists.”Meanwhile, in another operation, the Unit V of the Thane Crime Branch arrested a history-sheeter and seized a factory-made pistol and two live rounds from him last week. The police said the accused, Sunny Rathod, was arrested in Majiwada of Thane on January 12. A local criminal with cases like extortion and assault registered against him, Mr. Rathod has been externed from the Mumbai city limits, officers said."

A free-wheeling chat with Venkatesh, who stole the show with his brilliant comic timing in ‘F2’. He will be teaming up with nephew Naga Chaitanya next
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Venkatesh Daggubati, 59, is a bonafide Sankranti hero. He doesn’t mind people specifying his age. In fact, he makes no effort to camouflage it. In the wake of his filmF2having been declared a hit, he says that owes it to the audience who’ve been generous to his past Pongal releases. He states that the audience has overlooked and is willing to forgive discrepancies, if any, in the story and that prompted him to work hard despite an elbow injury and ensure that the film releases on January 12.Says Venkatesh, “I play a man past his prime wanting to get married and I make my age evident in a few scenes. I told the director to add that and once done, I felt comfortable. I enjoyed working with the senior actors, the women to be specific. It was a riot. I noticed the audience’s reaction at the theatres, it was crazy yet genuine. I went to a theatre after 10 years to gauge the mood. The television actors fromJabardasthhave been encouraging too, I was inspired and energised to get back to my style of comedy after a long time. I don’t remember when I did something like this the last time. I would go home from shoot and tell my family I did something crazy but I enjoyed doing it thoroughly.”Did he see a winning potential in the story? Venkatesh liked the script but had his doubts about going ballistic with comedy. He kept asking director Anil Ravipudi if it would work. The director saw Venkatesh’s earlier films likeSundarakanda, Abayigaru, Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuraluand was confident that it would work. The actor did it with an assurance that the director will strike a balance of creating a clean, fun film and go safe on the business side. They should be able to create a franchise and the director unmistakably hints at a sequel towards the end of the film. He heaps praise on the director, “The first day shoot was with the women. I noticed the technicians and junior artistes reacting in a positive way and thought that people might have been missing simple comedy and family stories. I asked the people there if they really want to see me like this and they said there is a segment which wanted to. Anil saw my timing and was on his own trip. He would improvise on the spot. I was supposed to work with him and Rana afterPataasbut Rana got busy withBaahubali. He has a spark. He did write forMasalatoo. We knew we had a great first half and the next was slightly identical toGundamma Katha; I just went with the flow. No film is 100% perfect. After a point, people will forgive.”Speaking about the scenes with a dog that brought the house down, Venkatesh says he had done that umpteen times and had alerted the director. People might ridicule if it isn’t fresh and urged a different treatment, it worked. Venkatesh shares a few moments that worked big time, “It was my own dog and they used a background score of sad number from my filmRaja. You saw the rapport right? Y Vijaya on one occasion saysabbayiheight and weightbavundhi..ageyenthaand there is a dialogue that goesadhi adogoddhammaplease,bagodhu. Ditto with the proposal scene while I buy vegetables with the women folk. Another dialogue that my father-in-law keeps sayingAnthegahas worked very well. Those after watching the film came out sayinganthega anthega. Even on the phone, people calling me are using that word. Prakash Raj and the other actors lent their experience and added value.”Men play a subservient role in the story and give into women all the time. The actor says there is nothing wrong in portraying characters that way; he says the greatest quality of a woman is that she is very giving. “I won my battle in all my roles in films likePavitra Bandhametc.” Venkatesh has a good word for Varun Tej too. The actor apparently took care of Venkatesh like his nephews Rana or Naga Chaitanya would, worrying about his food and comfort. He adds, “Varun had his own body language and was happy that he was learning a new comic expression. He was growing day by day, and I was there for him. He never went overboard.”Venaktesh’s next, says the actor, is a commercial with a lot of drama and action. This time, he’s teaming up with Naga Chaitanya. “The comfort level in the uncle-nephew story will be on a different level. We have to work with the younger generation. As long as directors have a good script that ensures minimum guarantee at the box office, it is enough. Combinations come later, but the fundamental point is in having safe script and budget. I am clear about that; I don’t get carried away.”I don’t remember when I did something like this the last time. I enjoyed it thoroughly."

Walk along the comic book route

Besides historic landmarks, waffles and chocolates, Brussels is a delight for its street art
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Graffiti was once frowned upon. Today, it’s an emerging form of art that has produced several international artistes of repute. Street art plastered across the streets, walls and buildings have become a tourist attraction internationally.Mexico City, Lisbon, Rio de Janeiro, New York, Prague and several other cities have a thriving street art culture. Art is sometimes used to attractively cover up crumbling buildings and give old, neglected walls a facelift. It livens up neighbourhoods and transforms the urban landscape.Brussels, the capital of Belgium, is no exception to street art and murals. We were bowled over by huge, colourful paintings on building walls. On our recent trip, we spent a day walking around the beautiful cobbled streets of Brussels, pausing at some of its popular attractions, before taking in sights of the colourful murals and street art.The Grand Place, situated in the heart of the city, is a huge and impressive square that’s surrounded on all four sides by extremely tall, spired buildings. We spent several minutes just taking in the panoramic 360-degree views and the sheer grandeur of the place. The buildings date back to the late 17th Century, and are covered with Baroque gables.The narrow cobblestone paths lead to the much-loved iconic Belgian symbol — the Manneken Pis. The bronze statue of a young, naked boy urinating into a fountain’s basin was created in the early 1600s. Legend has it that the boy named Julien found enemies trying to use gun powder to attack the city of Brussels. He put out the burning fuse by urinating on it and thus became a hero. There are other such statues as well — Jeanneke Pis (girl pissing) and Zinneke Pis (dog pissing).We then wandered through the high-end shopping street called Les Galeries Royales Saint Hubert, a beautiful glass-roofed shopping arcade, lined with cafés, and stores selling luxury labels.Our next stop was the highly impressive 11th-Century historic church — the Cathedral of St Michael and St Gudula. Constructed on a hill, the first view, as we approached the church, was spectacular. We learn that it took nearly 300 years to be completed, with each Brabant king adding a specific structure. It is dedicated to and named after Brussels’ patron saints Michael and Gudula. The church building is nearly 100 metres in length and we went around admiring the various statues — noted among them are those of the 12 apostles, Gothic architecture, beautiful glass-stained windows, stone columns, and the grand ceiling. Over the centuries, the church has been witness to several coronations and royal weddings — every pillar and every wall is steeped in history.Take your pickClose to the Manneken Pis, we spot a huge painting of the young and intrepid reporter Tintin, his faithful dog Snowy, and his good friend and fellow adventurer Captain Haddock on a building wall.

A riot of art forms

Andhra Art and Craft Hotel in Visakhapatnam offers its guests a taste of the State’s traditions from the comfort of their rooms
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"A large imposing mural of Telugu Thalli welcomes visitors to the newly-opened heritage wing of Palm Beach Hotel, named Andhra Art and Craft Hotel.With akalasamin her right hand and harvest crop in her left, the mural signifies the prosperity of the Telugu lands. Glistening at a distance are warm yellow lights attached to two wooden bullock-cart wheels suspended from the ceiling.The hotel’s interiors are a blend of contemporary architecture decked with traditional décor. The monotony of white walls is broken by brightly coloured doors. Choosing vibrant shades of blue, green, yellow and pink, the doors are in sync with the artworks inside.The 24-room seaside property is divided into four wings. Each wing is dedicated to one traditional art form from the State, namelyEtikoppaka, Budithi brassware,tholu bommalata(leather puppetry) andkalamkari.Over 30 artisans from Visakhapatnam have worked for over a year to create 70 sculptures and 50 art installations for the hotel. Every room has a customised headboard, study table and wardrobe that are designed following the art form.“While the planning and implementation took us over a year, it was the research about these art forms that took three to four years. The idea for the hotel is inspired by Le Sutra, an Indian Art hotel that is a sister concern of Palm Beach Hotel.Le Sutra is designed on threegunas— Tamas, Rajas and Sattva — that feature in Indian mythology,” says Ameet Mirpuri, a Visakhapatnam-based interior designer for Andhra Art and Craft Hotel.Started with an aim to familiarise people with the traditional art forms of the State, the team chose four art forms that have been part of Andhra culture for decades.Etikoppakacomes from a village of the same name situated in Visakhapatnam district. The village is renowned for its craftsmanship in making wooden toys from a locally-grown tree, Ankudu. Rooms designed according to this art form have aPandiri Mancham, an Andhra-style bed with a headboard that has wooden carvings used to makeEtikoppakatoys. “Traditionally, the artisans use natural dyes made with seeds, bark, lacquer, leaves and roots. In keeping with this, theEtikoppakamurals that we have in the rooms also are coloured with natural dyes,” says Ameet.The rooms themed around Budithi brass work have headboards inspired from sculptures of women adorned with jewellery, commonly seen in the carvings of local temples. Drawing inspiration from theUyala(swing) found in old houses, the sofas in these rooms have meticulously-carved brass chains replicating the swings.Taking visitors on a creative tour of the underwater world are the rooms designed withkalamkaripaintings. Headboards here are a splash of bright colour, painting ocean-related scenes using traditional motifs like leaves and flowers.Explaining the idea behind choosing the ocean theme, Srinivasa Rao Kanumari, the artist who made the paintings, says, “Usually,kalamkaripaintings draw heavily from mythology. However, since this project was about an innovative take on traditional artforms, I took the creative liberty to paint quirky scenes like a man taking a whale on a walk or a shark blowing a trumpet.”He adds that going beyond the conventional reds, greens and blacks used forkalamakari, he used vibrant colours like blue, turquoise green and yellow. It took him six months to paint the six paintings displayed in the rooms.The rooms that are inspired bytholu bommalatahave been designed to create a local fair, as traditionally this puppetry was widely seen in these fairs. The headboards have huge leather puppets against a painted backdrop. The sofas in these rooms remind you of soda carts with colourful glasses and stationary wheels attached to them.However, it is not just the rooms that display the State’s rich art forms. Even the room numbers have been customised to stand up to the tag of an art and craft hotel. The numbers and letters used on the plates have been specially created by art graduate Krupanand Kartik, who used an amalgamation of English numericals and letters with graphics inspired from temple architecture. The hotel is surrounded by garden lined with wall murals.Rooms in the heritage wing are priced higher than the other rooms in Palm Beach Hotel. Spending a night in the company of these artworks will cost you around Rs. 7,500. As an added incentive, you can get a quick class on each art form and its origin from the hotel staff, who have been trained to educate guests.Size matters?Germany-based Eh’hausl Hotel holds the record for the smallest hotel. Sandwiched between two buildings, it can occupy two guests at any given time."

Walk along the comic book route

Besides historic landmarks, waffles and chocolates, Brussels is a delight for its street art
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Graffiti was once frowned upon. Today, it’s an emerging form of art that has produced several international artistes of repute. Street art plastered across the streets, walls and buildings have become a tourist attraction internationally.Mexico City, Lisbon, Rio de Janeiro, New York, Prague and several other cities have a thriving street art culture. Art is sometimes used to attractively cover up crumbling buildings and give old, neglected walls a facelift. It livens up neighbourhoods and transforms the urban landscape.Brussels, the capital of Belgium, is no exception to street art and murals. We were bowled over by huge, colourful paintings on building walls. On our recent trip, we spent a day walking around the beautiful cobbled streets of Brussels, pausing at some of its popular attractions, before taking in sights of the colourful murals and street art.The Grand Place, situated in the heart of the city, is a huge and impressive square that’s surrounded on all four sides by extremely tall, spired buildings. We spent several minutes just taking in the panoramic 360-degree views and the sheer grandeur of the place. The buildings date back to the late 17th Century, and are covered with Baroque gables.The narrow cobblestone paths lead to the much-loved iconic Belgian symbol — the Manneken Pis. The bronze statue of a young, naked boy urinating into a fountain’s basin was created in the early 1600s. Legend has it that the boy named Julien found enemies trying to use gun powder to attack the city of Brussels. He put out the burning fuse by urinating on it and thus became a hero. There are other such statues as well — Jeanneke Pis (girl pissing) and Zinneke Pis (dog pissing).We then wandered through the high-end shopping street called Les Galeries Royales Saint Hubert, a beautiful glass-roofed shopping arcade, lined with cafés, and stores selling luxury labels.Our next stop was the highly impressive 11th-Century historic church — the Cathedral of St Michael and St Gudula. Constructed on a hill, the first view, as we approached the church, was spectacular. We learn that it took nearly 300 years to be completed, with each Brabant king adding a specific structure. It is dedicated to and named after Brussels’ patron saints Michael and Gudula. The church building is nearly 100 metres in length and we went around admiring the various statues — noted among them are those of the 12 apostles, Gothic architecture, beautiful glass-stained windows, stone columns, and the grand ceiling. Over the centuries, the church has been witness to several coronations and royal weddings — every pillar and every wall is steeped in history.Take your pickClose to the Manneken Pis, we spot a huge painting of the young and intrepid reporter Tintin, his faithful dog Snowy, and his good friend and fellow adventurer Captain Haddock on a building wall. The project of paying tribute to Belgian cartoonists began in 1991; titled the Comic Book Route, it had 10 murals back then. Today, there are nearly 60 murals of Belgian cartoon characters painted on building walls throughout the city.The Broussaille Wall features a couple walking cheerfully through the streets. We also saw the Victor Sackville Wall, where a British spy of the same name is shown with his lady. Brussels’ street art culture also has Herge’s other cartoon characters — Quick and Flupke, the two naughty boys hiding from the police — splashed on a wall.We walked past Olivier Rameau’s Wall, a festive mural that shows colourful celebrations in a fantasy land. The popular cartoon of Smurfs, the little blue heroes created by cartoonist Peyo, is near Brussels Central Station.A day in Brussels is a chance to try their famous gastronomic delights like waffles, chocolates, fries, while viewing the spectacular and colourful murals.The Cathedral of St Michael and St Gudula took nearly 300 years to be completed, with each Brabant king adding a specific structureFantasy landsInKing Ottokar's Sceptre, a Tintin adventure, Hergé creates two fictional countries, Syldavia and Borduria, and invites the reader to tour them through a travel brochure in the storyline."

This week, eight performances pay tribute to Saadat Hasan Manto — on his 64th death anniversary
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Black MarginsorSiyah Hashiyeis one of Saadat Hasan Manto’s most searing compilations, and it contains terse prose pieces in Urdu, some only a few lines long, that capture, in just a breath or a gasp, grim images of Partition that continue to unsettle the reader long after the words are forgotten. Published in 1948, after Manto had migrated to Pakistan, the writings were the glowing embers of disenchantment that had lodged themselves deep in the writer’s psyche. Nandita Das’ eponymous film depicts a gloomy shadow cast over Mumbai, even if it largely escaped the rioting that took place in other parts of the country.Test of timeHearsay or rumours, or personal testimonials of survivors, had created an atmosphere of festering dread thatSiyah Hashiyecollates. Some experiences might have been first-hand accounts that had exchanged many hands, other the re-imagining of horror. Even in their pithiness they smack of strong reportage. Manto’s tendency to focus on human nature gone awry did not endear him to sections of the Pakistani literati, depicted as stone-faced and cold in the film. The collection was dismissed as overtly ‘sensational’ by a reviewer. The test of time has served it well though. In Manto’s embracing of the underbelly and the stories lurching within it, there is a stark revulsion certainly, but the gaze is empathetic, and the outlook secular, long before such a term had gained currency.Writing with conscienceThis week, on Manto’s 64th death anniversary (January 18), Studio Tamaasha has announced a tribute toSiyah Hashiye. Manto - A Black Marginwill take place at the Mysore Association in Matunga. It’s a rare sojourn away from their usual hideout in Aaram Nagar, but the new venue will allow a larger audience. Of late, Tamaasha events have been growing in popularity, and often cannot accommodate all who turn up for their events. The event will consist of a melange of cultural activities — an exhibition of paintings, stand-up sketches, a contemporary dance piece, a session by Narendra Mohan that will critically analyses the text, and a dramatic performance directed by Sunil Shanbag. Given the source material, brevity will likely be of the essence.Over the years, Manto’s works have provided prolific fodder to the theatre fringe without any letup. His writings were never written for the stage, although he had penned several radio plays, but when delivered with a certain rigour, they provide challenging excursions for conscientious actors. The solo performance circuit, if there is such a thing, is littered with discharges of anguish that had first found expression on his pages. Gravitas gives way to declamation at times, and deadpan reflection to melodrama, but in the end, Manto’s punches land with characteristic élan.Big ticket ventures into Manto’s dark turf include the plays by Neelam Mansingh Chowdhry —Naked Voices,Dark Borders(also based onSiyah Hashiye) andBitter Fruit. In the latter, the director’s penchant for a ‘theatre of images’ combined well with scenographer Deepan Sivaraman’s own fecund visual proclivities. In Chowdhry’s Manto pieces, there is a sensuous beauty to the proceedings brought alive by actors’ bodies conditioned to both sprightly movement and verbal expression. The plays are often a photographer’s delight. The devising of metaphors from sand or cloth or tarpaulin are aesthetically charged, and the set-pieces sometimes too dazzling to the eye but, in a visceral sense, the grotesqueness of human nature as observed and recorded by Manto comes through.Intense performancesIn contrast, Atelier Theatre’s foray into Manto withKuchh Afsane, attempts to work with ugliness directly, foregrounding a rawness of presentation and a roughness of performance. The interplay between men and women in enactments of pieces likeThanda GoshtorBoo, comes across as unseemly rather than potent. These versions veer from one end of the aesthetic spectrum to another, but perhaps it is Das’ film that manages much more in terms of how a Manto story might be staged or filmed — the film is interspersed with dramatic enactments of Manto’s tales.At any one point, there’s always a Manto piece being performed in some part of the city (and Delhi is no exception). This week apart from the Tamaasha tribute, there are plays like Mujeeb Khan’sIsmat Manto’s JugalbandiandManto ka Deewanapan; Mudit Singhal’sManto ki Roomaniyat, Mohit Sharma’s solo performanceToba Tek Singh; andJashn-e-Qalaam: Manto Bedi and Chughtaiat the Harkat Studios; all jostling for space in a crowded arts calendar."

Dalit groups incensed at relief for Milind Ekbote

To challenge relaxation of bail conditions in High Court
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Dalit outfits are irked at a Pune court’s decision to grant relief to Hindutva leader Milind Ekbote, who is accused of orchestrating the Bhima-Koregaon clashes on January 1 last year.FIRs had been lodged on January 2, 2018 against Mr. Ekbote, who heads Samasta Hindu Aghadi, and Sambhaji Bhide, founder of the Sangli-based right-wing group, Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan.On Monday, the court lifted restrictions on Mr. Ekbote holding public rallies, speaking to the media and making mandatory appearances at the Shikrapur police station. In a bid to quash the relief, the Republican Yuva Morcha is planning to move the Bombay High Court. Meanwhile, the Ramdas Athawale-led RPI (A), an ally of the BJP, has accused the Home Department of covertly backing Mr. Ekbote.‘Going soft on accused’RPI (A) leader Siddharth Dhende accused the Pune police of deliberately “going soft” on Mr. Ekbote and failing to make a strong case against him despite ample evidence. Mr. Dhende said, “It is ironic that the Pune police are overzealous about prosecuting an eminent writer, educationist and civil rights activist like Anand Teltumbde, who is not remotely connected with the Bhima-Koregaon clashes. Yet, they fail to make a case against Mr. Ekbote, the chief instigator of the riots. The police’s slipshod probe has led the court to relax the stringent conditions.”Mr. Dhende said the police’s soft-pedaling of a habitual offender like Mr. Ekbote could only imply “pressure from above”. He said Mr. Ekbote would now ratchet up tensions at Bhima-Koregaon and its neighbouring villages, and threaten witnesses to the January 1 violence. Mr. Dhende said, “Our party president, Mr. Ramdas Athawale will speak to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on re-imposing controls and checks on Mr. Ekbote.”Rahul Dambale, State president of the Republican Yuva Morcha, said if Mr. Ekbote was ‘innocent’, then why did the Pune rural police issue prohibitory orders against him on the eve of the 201st anniversary of the Bhima- Koregaon battle this year. Mr. Dambale said, “The least the Pune police could have done was to present a strong case before the court to maintain the conditions of Mr. Ekbote’s bail till he was chargesheeted. This clearly proves that the authorities are being pressured by the State government and the Home Department.”He said in October 2001, when Mr. Ekbote came under the police scanner after a riot in Saswad, top district authorities mulled action against him under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug-Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act, 1981.‘Infamous for rioting’Mr. Dambale said, “Mr. Ekbote, who was notorious even then for aggravating social tensions, narrowly evaded arrest in 2001 only by the reported intervention of a person no less than senior BJP leader L.K. Advani, who was the then Union Minister for Home Affairs.”He said since then, Mr. Ekbote has been embroiled in at least 27 cases of rioting. Mr. Dambale said, “Our outfit is going to challenge the ‘relaxation’ in the Bombay High Court. We demand that he [Mr. Ekbote] be prosecuted under the MPDA Act.”Anita Ravindra Salve, a member of the Bahujan Republican Socialist Party, and Anjana Gaikwad had filed an FIR in Pimpri-Chinchwad against Mr. Bhide and Mr. Ekbote. The Shikrapur police had also lodged a case against Mr. Ekbote under Section 307 (attempt to murder) under the Indian Penal Code, and relevant sections of the Maharashtra Property Damage Act. While Mr. Bhide has never been questioned in connection with the clashes, Mr. Ekbote was granted conditional bail in April last year.The least the Pune police could have done was to present a strong case before the court to maintain the conditions of Mr. Ekbote’s bail till he was chargesheetedRahul DambaleState president, Republican Yuva Morcha"

A free-wheeling chat with Venkatesh, who stole the show with his brilliant comic timing in ‘F2’. He will be teaming up with nephew Naga Chaitanya next
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Venkatesh Daggubati, 59, is a bonafide Sankranti hero. He doesn’t mind people specifying his age. In fact, he makes no effort to camouflage it. In the wake of his filmF2having been declared a hit, he says that owes it to the audience who’ve been generous to his past Pongal releases. He states that the audience has overlooked and is willing to forgive discrepancies, if any, in the story and that prompted him to work hard despite an elbow injury and ensure that the film releases on January 12.Says Venkatesh, “I play a man past his prime wanting to get married and I make my age evident in a few scenes. I told the director to add that and once done, I felt comfortable. I enjoyed working with the senior actors, the women to be specific. It was a riot. I noticed the audience’s reaction at the theatres, it was crazy yet genuine. I went to a theatre after 10 years to gauge the mood. The television actors fromJabardasthhave been encouraging too, I was inspired and energised to get back to my style of comedy after a long time. I don’t remember when I did something like this the last time. I would go home from shoot and tell my family I did something crazy but I enjoyed doing it thoroughly.”Did he see a winning potential in the story? Venkatesh liked the script but had his doubts about going ballistic with comedy. He kept asking director Anil Ravipudi if it would work. The director saw Venkatesh’s earlier films likeSundarakanda, Abayigaru, Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuraluand was confident that it would work. The actor did it with an assurance that the director will strike a balance of creating a clean, fun film and go safe on the business side. They should be able to create a franchise and the director unmistakably hints at a sequel towards the end of the film. He heaps praise on the director, “The first day shoot was with the women. I noticed the technicians and junior artistes reacting in a positive way and thought that people might have been missing simple comedy and family stories. I asked the people there if they really want to see me like this and they said there is a segment which wanted to. Anil saw my timing and was on his own trip. He would improvise on the spot. I was supposed to work with him and Rana afterPataasbut Rana got busy withBaahubali. He has a spark. He did write forMasalatoo. We knew we had a great first half and the next was slightly identical toGundamma Katha; I just went with the flow. No film is 100% perfect. After a point, people will forgive.”Speaking about the scenes with a dog that brought the house down, Venkatesh says he had done that umpteen times and had alerted the director. People might ridicule if it isn’t fresh and urged a different treatment, it worked. Venkatesh shares a few moments that worked big time, “It was my own dog and they used a background score of sad number from my filmRaja. You saw the rapport right? Y Vijaya on one occasion saysabbayiheight and weightbavundhi..ageyenthaand there is a dialogue that goesadhi adogoddhammaplease,bagodhu. Ditto with the proposal scene while I buy vegetables with the women folk. Another dialogue that my father-in-law keeps sayingAnthegahas worked very well. Those after watching the film came out sayinganthega anthega. Even on the phone, people calling me are using that word. Prakash Raj and the other actors lent their experience and added value.”Men play a subservient role in the story and give into women all the time. The actor says there is nothing wrong in portraying characters that way; he says the greatest quality of a woman is that she is very giving. “I won my battle in all my roles in films likePavitra Bandhametc.” Venkatesh has a good word for Varun Tej too. The actor apparently took care of Venkatesh like his nephews Rana or Naga Chaitanya would, worrying about his food and comfort. He adds, “Varun had his own body language and was happy that he was learning a new comic expression. He was growing day by day, and I was there for him. He never went overboard.”Venaktesh’s next, says the actor, is a commercial with a lot of drama and action. This time, he’s teaming up with Naga Chaitanya. “The comfort level in the uncle-nephew story will be on a different level. We have to work with the younger generation. As long as directors have a good script that ensures minimum guarantee at the box office, it is enough. Combinations come later, but the fundamental point is in having safe script and budget. I am clear about that; I don’t get carried away.”"

However, since this project was about an innovative take on traditional artforms, I took the creative liberty to paint quirky scenes like a man taking a whale on a walk or a shark blowing a trumpet.”He adds that going beyond the conventional reds, greens and blacks used forkalamakari, he used vibrant colours like blue, turquoise green and yellow. It took him six months to paint the six paintings displayed in the rooms.The rooms that are inspired bytholu bommalatahave been designed to create a local fair, as traditionally this puppetry was widely seen in these fairs. The headboards have huge leather puppets against a painted backdrop. The sofas in these rooms remind you of soda carts with colourful glasses and stationary wheels attached to them.However, it is not just the rooms that display the State’s rich art forms. Even the room numbers have been customised to stand up to the tag of an art and craft hotel. The numbers and alphabet used on the plates have been specially created by art graduate Krupanand Kartik, who used an amalgamation of English numericals and alphabet with graphics inspired from temple architecture. The hotel is surrounded by garden lined with wall murals.Rooms in the heritage wing are priced higher than the other rooms in Palm Beach Hotel. Spending a night in the company of these artworks will cost you around ₹7,500. As an added incentive, you can get a quick class on each art form and its origin from the hotel staff, who have been trained to educate guests."

You can see the difference by comparing it with the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre. The Congress was trying to grab control of our ‘gurdhams’ by instigating the Sikhs against each other but the Modi-led government fulfilled a long-pending desire of every Sikh to have hassle-free access to the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara,” said Mr. Badal at a rally in Muktsar.“The Khalsa panth would forever be indebted to Mr. Modi, who took the decision to make the Kartarpur corridor a reality and delivered justice to the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots by setting up SIT to reopen the cases,” he said.Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal said that anti-Sikh forces were trying hard to defame the party and it senior leadership in their desperate attempt to gain control over Sikh institutions including the SGPC.“The affairs of the SGPC are run by representatives of the Sikh community, not by the 'Badal family' as they put it to misguide the Sikhs. These so-called panthic forces are the B-team of Congress” he said."

The curious case of Amjad’s encounter
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/the-curious-case-of-amjads-encounter/article25988092.ece,"
A youth in his 20s died in an 'encounter' with a U.P. police team in 2007. Almost 12 years on, his 65-year-old mother continues to wage a lone battle against 11 policemen involved in the incident.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Clad in a black burqa covering her from head to toe, 65-year-old Akhtari takes tired steps towards the lawyer’s chamber in Muzaffarnagar court. She doesn’t remember the number of times she has visited the premises. It’s been nearly 12 years, she says, recalling her painful journey which began when she lost her 25-year-old son, Amjad, in February 2007. The struggle only got tougher when she lost her husband, Khalid Khan, in 2011, she adds.Amjad was killed in a police encounter in Muzaffarnagar’s Ratanpuri and the incident presents a grim reality of a “manufactured and fake encounter”, says Akhtari’s lawyer Qazi Naim.Early yearsAmjad was born and brought up in Roorkee’s Manglaur town. He received his education at a madrasa he attended till his teenage. His father tried to get him into his line of work, masonry, but Amjad had different plans. “He was different from the rest of us. He was jovial and every neighbour’s darling,” Akhtari recalls.Around the age of 20 in the early 2000s, he moved to Saharanpur to live with his maternal uncle and aunt and became a truck driver to earn a living, which, his mother says, was “the worst decision of his life”.Over a year after he moved to his uncle’s place, says Akhtari, during one of his visits back home, he told her that his “aunt was in a relationship with a policeman, constable Mir Hasan, who used to come home often and it did not look nice”.He allegedly told this to his uncle too, but the man “didn’t take any action”. The policeman, the family claimed, was posted in Saharanpur at that time.Amjad allegedly told Hasan not to visit his uncle’s home and end his relationship with his aunt. “I told him not to interfere in their family matter and not make a police officer his enemy but he did not listen,” she says.Criminal casesSoon after that a series of criminal charges were levelled against Amjad without any evidence, adds Akhtari.In March 2005, a person identified as Zuber was shot dead in Saharanpur’s Mandi area and Amjad was named among the accused by the police on charges of murder and rioting. According to the police, Zuber was murdered by a gang of land grabbers for whom he was becoming a problem.In April 2005, the police registered another FIR against Amjad on charges of attempt to murder. The complaint said that sub-inspector Pravin Kumar and a few other officers had received a tip-off that “Amjad, who was wanted in the Zuber murder case, was going towards Nawabganj”. The police said they saw Amjad coming along with another man and asked him to stop. The duo allegedly fired at the police party after which Amjad managed to flee while the other man was held.In May 2005, another FIR was registered against Amjad and two others wherein the police alleged that SI Kumar, constable Hasan and a few others were travelling in a police vehicle when they saw three persons coming on a motorcycle and asked them to stop “suspecting something amiss”. The three allegedly fired at the police vehicle and were subsequently held. A case of attempt to murder and Arms Act was registered against the three, including Amjad.In 2006, a city court acquitted Amjad in all three cases after finding the police version unsubstantiated. ’A year later, in the early hours of February 3, 2007, Amjad was killed in an “encounter” with a police team including SI Kumar, constable Hasan, SI Iqbal Uzzama Khan and eight others, in Muzaffarnagar’s Ratanpuri. Iqbal was then posted in the Anti-Extortion Cell, Kumar was Ratanpuri’s Station Officer and Hasan was posted in the same police station.The next day the headlines in the regional newspapers read “Uttaranchal ka shatir Amjad mara gaya (Uttaranchal’s notorious criminal Amjad shot dead)”, says Akhtari, adding that he was tagged a criminal despite being acquitted in all the cases.She recalls that Amjad had left his uncle and aunt’s house and returned to Manglaur when cases started piling up against him.The fateful nightOn the night of February 1, Akhtari says, several policemen knocked on their door around 11 p.m. The family, which was watching television after having dinner, was taken aback as were the neighbours who saw the policemen taking Amjad with them.“They said they wanted to ask him some questions and would send him back the next day, but they killed him instead,” the mother says.On February 2, the family claims to have tried everything in its power to bring the son back. While the parents and other family members went to the Ratanpuri police station, some 90 km away from Manglaur, to look for the son, Amjad’s uncle Munavvar Khan, the family claims, went to the District Magistrate’s office and informed them that his nephew had been picked up by the police who may “try to implicate him in false cases or even kill him”. The family was suggested to do so by a lawyer they had contacted at the time.On February 3, around 7 a.m., Amjad’s family was informed by the Manglaur police that he had been killed in Ratanpuri in an encounter. The family rushed to Muzaffarnagar only to find his body with several bullet injuries.The police registered an attempt to murder case leading to the encounter, similar to the narrative presented in May 2005. The police said that the team led by Kumar was patrolling when it received an information that three criminals were coming from Khatauli on a motorcycle.The officers intercepted them at Rampur junction and asked them to stop but they fired at them. “In retaliation”, police fired at them which led to the death of Amjad. The other two, the police said, managed to flee taking advantage of the dark night.Endless waitThe family has been running from pillar to post since that day seeking justice for Amjad. A protest was organised on February 6, followed by endless court proceedings, but the wait is still not over.The family approached Muzaffarnagar court in November 2007 with their complaint alleging that Amjad was killed in a fake encounter. In March 2008, the court ordered that it will get the matter investigated.Over the next few years, the court proceedings went on and witnesses were heard. Neighbours Zinda Hasan, Abdul Manan, Mohd. Wasi, Mohd. Rashid and Husain Ahmed told the court that they saw the policemen taking Amjad from home.Meanwhile, the police submitted their final report in the incident on May 30, 2007, stating that the two absconding persons could not be found and the investigation had been closed. The final report was signed by Inspector Ajay Chauhan, the second investigator in the case, who is now posted in Muzaffarnagar’s Crime Branch.When questioned about the case, he claims to have “faint memory” of the incident as he was posted out a few months later and could not keep track.Plea to rights panelThe family also approached National Human Rights Commission, which, it claims, conducted an independent investigation and ordered a compensation of ₹5lakh in January 2018. The family received the cheque in March last year; the money deducted from the salaries of the 11 officers involved in the case.But soon after the compensation was given to the family, Iqbal, who retired as Deputy Superintendent of Police, lodged an FIR against all the witnesses in the case on charges of cheating and allegedly forging a letter sent to the District Magistrate on February 2, 2007, “based on which the compensation was given”.“We got a stay on the arrest order from the court which said the police had to first submit an investigation report,” says advocate Naim.The Muzaffarnagar police submitted a chargesheet in the case on January 3 this year, says Deputy Superintendent of Police Harish Bhadauria. “The magisterial enquiry found out that no such letter was submitted to the DM’s office in February 2007,” says the officer.Akhtari approached the High Court in 2018 with a request to take action in her case. The court, on May 28, ordered the court concerned (Muzaffarnagar) to expedite the hearing in the matter and decide the same, preferably, within a period of three months of the order.To the mother’s relief, in December 2018, the Muzaffarnagar court summoned the police officers involved in the encounter. They have been asked to appear before the court again on January 25.“This order [December 2018] has given me some hope,” the mother says.Lone battleAkhtari has been fighting alone for the last eight years after her husband died of a heart attack. “The two of us always travelled together for all the proceedings in the case. He was more optimistic than me. He always used to say that we will get justice,” she recalls.Now Akhtari goes to the court with her other children or relatives. She has 10 children, including two daughters; all aged between 18 and 45. Most of her sons are working as masons and one of the two daughters is married.“In the last 11 years, there has not been a single marriage in my family though five of my children are of marriageable age. We have spent ₹9-₹10 lakh on the case so far. I thought I will get my daughter married with the compensation money but they slapped another case on us,” says Akhtari.But she is relentless. “I want justice for my son... only then will I be at peace,” she says. “So many times my children have told me stop but I won’t.”Even as Akhtari wait for justice continues, one of the accused policemen, Kumar, passed away three years ago after a prolonged fight with cancer.Today Akhtari’s most favourite memory of Amjad is from January 26, 2007, a few days before he was killed. “He had organised Republic Day celebrations a nearby local school run by one of our neighbours. I remember he bought sweets for all the children and taught them a song ‘Ye Hindustan hamara hai’.”She is looking forward to the Republic Day celebrations this year too, hoping for some positive news from the hearing a day before."

The curious case of Amjad’s encounter

A youth in his 20s died in an 'encounter' with a U.P. police team in 2007. Almost 12 years on, his 65-year-old mother continues to wage a lone battle against 11 policemen involved in the incident. Hemani Bhandari visitsMuzaffarnagarto find out why Akhtari refuses to give up her unending 'fight for justice'
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Clad in a black burqa covering her from head to toe, 65-year-old Akhtari takes tired steps towards the lawyer’s chamber in Muzaffarnagar court. She doesn’t remember the number of times she has visited the premises. It’s been nearly 12 years, she says, recalling her painful journey which began when she lost her 25-year-old son, Amjad, in February 2007. The struggle only got tougher when she lost her husband, Khalid Khan, in 2011, she adds.Amjad was killed in a police encounter in Muzaffarnagar’s Ratanpuri and the incident presents a grim reality of a “manufactured and fake encounter”, says Akhtari’s lawyer Qazi Naim.Early yearsAmjad was born and brought up in Roorkee’s Manglaur town. He received his education at a madrasa he attended till his teenage. His father tried to get him into his line of work, masonry, but Amjad had different plans. “He was different from the rest of us. He was jovial and every neighbour’s darling,” Akhtari recalls.Around the age of 20 in the early 2000s, he moved to Saharanpur to live with his maternal uncle and aunt and became a truck driver to earn a living, which, his mother says, was “the worst decision of his life”.Over a year after he moved to his uncle’s place, says Akhtari, during one of his visits back home, he told her that his “aunt was in a relationship with a policeman, constable Mir Hasan, who used to come home often and it did not look nice”.He allegedly told this to his uncle too, but the man “didn’t take any action”. The policeman, the family claimed, was posted in Saharanpur at that time.Amjad allegedly told Hasan not to visit his uncle’s home and end his relationship with his aunt. “I told him not to interfere in their family matter and not make a police officer his enemy but he did not listen,” she says.Criminal casesSoon after that a series of criminal charges were levelled against Amjad without any evidence, adds Akhtari.In March 2005, a person identified as Zuber was shot dead in Saharanpur’s Mandi area and Amjad was named among the accused by the police on charges of murder and rioting. According to the police, Zuber was murdered by a gang of land grabbers for whom he was becoming a problem.In April 2005, the police registered another FIR against Amjad on charges of attempt to murder. The complaint said that sub-inspector Pravin Kumar and a few other officers had received a tip-off that “Amjad, who was wanted in the Zuber murder case, was going towards Nawabganj”. The police said they saw Amjad coming along with another man and asked him to stop. The duo allegedly fired at the police party after which Amjad managed to flee while the other man was held.In May 2005, another FIR was registered against Amjad and two others wherein the police alleged that SI Kumar, constable Hasan and a few others were travelling in a police vehicle when they saw three persons coming on a motorcycle and asked them to stop “suspecting something amiss”. The three allegedly fired at the police vehicle and were subsequently held. A case of attempt to murder and Arms Act was registered against the three, including Amjad.In 2006, a city court acquitted Amjad in all three cases after finding the police version unsubstantiated. ’A year later, in the early hours of February 3, 2007, Amjad was killed in an “encounter” with a police team including SI Kumar, constable Hasan, SI Iqbal Uzzama Khan and eight others, in Muzaffarnagar’s Ratanpuri. Iqbal was then posted in the Anti-Extortion Cell, Kumar was Ratanpuri’s Station Officer and Hasan was posted in the same police station.The next day the headlines in the regional newspapers read “Uttaranchal ka shatir Amjad mara gaya (Uttaranchal’s notorious criminal Amjad shot dead)”, says Akhtari, adding that he was tagged a criminal despite being acquitted in all the cases.She recalls that Amjad had left his uncle and aunt’s house and returned to Manglaur when cases started piling up against him.The fateful nightOn the night of February 1, Akhtari says, several policemen knocked on their door around 11 p.m. The family, which was watching television after having dinner, was taken aback as were the neighbours who saw the policemen taking Amjad with them.“They said they wanted to ask him some questions and would send him back the next day, but they killed him instead,” the mother says.On February 2, the family claims to have tried everything in its power to bring the son back. While the parents and other family members went to the Ratanpuri police station, some 90 km away from Manglaur, to look for the son, Amjad’s uncle Munavvar Khan, the family claims, went to the District Magistrate’s office and informed them that his nephew had been picked up by the police who may “try to implicate him in false cases or even kill him”. The family was suggested to do so by a lawyer they had contacted at the time.On February 3, around 7 a.m., Amjad’s family was informed by the Manglaur police that he had been killed in Ratanpuri in an encounter. The family rushed to Muzaffarnagar only to find his body with several bullet injuries.The police registered an attempt to murder case leading to the encounter, similar to the narrative presented in May 2005. The police said that the team led by Kumar was patrolling when it received an information that three criminals were coming from Khatauli on a motorcycle.The officers intercepted them at Rampur junction and asked them to stop but they fired at them. “In retaliation”, police fired at them which led to the death of Amjad. The other two, the police said, managed to flee taking advantage of the dark night.Endless waitThe family has been running from pillar to post since that day seeking justice for Amjad. A protest was organised on February 6, followed by endless court proceedings, but the wait is still not over.The family approached Muzaffarnagar court in November 2007 with their complaint alleging that Amjad was killed in a fake encounter. In March 2008, the court ordered that it will get the matter investigated.Over the next few years, the court proceedings went on and witnesses were heard. Neighbours Zinda Hasan, Abdul Manan, Mohd. Wasi, Mohd. Rashid and Husain Ahmed told the court that they saw the policemen taking Amjad from home.Meanwhile, the police submitted their final report in the incident on May 30, 2007, stating that the two absconding persons could not be found and the investigation had been closed. The final report was signed by Inspector Ajay Chauhan, the second investigator in the case, who is now posted in Muzaffarnagar’s Crime Branch.When questioned about the case, he claims to have “faint memory” of the incident as he was posted out a few months later and could not keep track.Plea to rights panelThe family also approached National Human Rights Commission, which, it claims, conducted an independent investigation and ordered a compensation of Rs. 5lakh in January 2018. The family received the cheque in March last year; the money deducted from the salaries of the 11 officers involved in the case.But soon after the compensation was given to the family, Iqbal, who retired as Deputy Superintendent of Police, lodged an FIR against all the witnesses in the case on charges of cheating and allegedly forging a letter sent to the District Magistrate on February 2, 2007, “based on which the compensation was given”.“We got a stay on the arrest order from the court which said the police had to first submit an investigation report,” says advocate Naim.The Muzaffarnagar police submitted a chargesheet in the case on January 3 this year, says Deputy Superintendent of Police Harish Bhadauria. “The magisterial enquiry found out that no such letter was submitted to the DM’s office in February 2007,” says the officer.Akhtari approached the High Court in 2018 with a request to take action in her case. The court, on May 28, ordered the court concerned (Muzaffarnagar) to expedite the hearing in the matter and decide the same, preferably, within a period of three months of the order.To the mother’s relief, in December 2018, the Muzaffarnagar court summoned the police officers involved in the encounter. They have been asked to appear before the court again on January 25.“This order [December 2018] has given me some hope,” the mother says.Lone battleAkhtari has been fighting alone for the last eight years after her husband died of a heart attack. “The two of us always travelled together for all the proceedings in the case. He was more optimistic than me. He always used to say that we will get justice,” she recalls.Now Akhtari goes to the court with her other children or relatives. She has 10 children, including two daughters; all aged between 18 and 45. Most of her sons are working as masons and one of the two daughters is married.“In the last 11 years, there has not been a single marriage in my family though five of my children are of marriageable age. We have spent Rs. 9-Rs. 10 lakh on the case so far. I thought I will get my daughter married with the compensation money but they slapped another case on us,” says Akhtari.But she is relentless. “I want justice for my son... only then will I be at peace,” she says. “So many times my children have told me stop but I won’t.”Even as Akhtari wait for justice continues, one of the accused policemen, Kumar, passed away three years ago after a prolonged fight with cancer.Today Akhtari’s most favourite memory of Amjad is from January 26, 2007, a few days before he was killed. “He had organised Republic Day celebrations a nearby local school run by one of our neighbours. I remember he bought sweets for all the children and taught them a song ‘Ye Hindustan hamara hai’.”She is looking forward to the Republic Day celebrations this year too, hoping for some positive news from the hearing a day before."

Justice Nisar noted that the government has no plan to compensate the losses.“Two and half months have passed but the government has not submitted any plan for compensation. It is the court that takes pain. If the court didn’t order then this plan would not come either,” he added.

She had earlier been sentenced to death on blasphemy charges by the Lahore High Court. Enraged mobs had blocked several routes across the country for three days, while at some places they had also set fire to vehicles. The demonstrations resulted in countrywide closure of schools, colleges and universities, as well as cancellation of examinations.After three days, the government and the protesters led by the TLP had reached an agreement. The government, however, later launched a crackdown against the party on November 24 and arrested its top leaders as well as thousands of supporters."

Heavy rush at railway, bus stations

People seen making a beeline for the bus complex and railway station, since the early hours.Though the East Coast Railway (ECoR) is running special trains to meet the festive rush, they seemed to be inadequate. Trains towards Vijayawada, Secunderabad, Bhubaneswar and Howrah, witnessed unprecedented rush, like never before.Janmabhoomi express, which runs between Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, Simhadri, Ratnachal Express, Howrah -Yeshwantpur, Howrah Mail, Prasanthi Express, Intercity Express, were full and people were jostling for space and did not bother to stand and travel for four to five hours.Even the reserved compartments looked like general bogies, with commuters trying to find a foothold. The general compartments in several trains to Howrah were packed and passengers from Visakhapatnam were not able to enter the bogies. A number of passengers perched themselves on the luggage racks.The platforms were overcrowded and and whenever a train arrived there was a riot-like situation. For originating trains from Vizag, the railway authorities organised police security, who made the people embark into the train by organising queue.RTC bus complexMs. Sharadha, who was travelling with her two kids from Rajahmundry to Bhubaneswar in Prasanthi Express, said “We were not able to reach the washroom due to the packed crowd. All tickets were booked at least a month ago and we had to take a train as there was no other option.”Dwaraka Bus Complex witnessed a similar scene. Buses towards Rajahmundry, Vijayawada, Eluru, Srikakulam, Tekkali, Palas and Amalapuram were full. Passengers fought for seats in buses, whenever a bus halted at the platforms. And since there was no police to organise things, the scene was chaotic and women and children were the worst sufferers. Long queue lines were witnessed at the non-stop counters to Srikakulam, Narsipatnam, Annavaram, Rajahmundry. Even though the RTC officials managed to run a non-stop or single stop buses for every 10 minutes, every bus was packed.There were several altercations, as a few women argued demanding separate queue lines for them.Demand for cabsThere was a section of people, who in order to avoid stress, booked cabs to reach their destinations. The cab owners made brisk business by jacking up the rates, as most of the commuters were students, who were desperate to reach home.A student from Gayatri Vidhya Parishad, S Meghanath along with four friends, had booked a taxi to Rajahmundry. “We all are residents of Rajahmundry. Coming to know about the passenger rush in trains and buses, we booked a car from a travel agency. The driver charged on kilometre basis and it amounted to around ₹4,200. All five of us, shared the amount,” he said.Private buses, also doubled the price and seats available were few."

Serving hearty meals, fostering sisterhood

Shining in its golden-brown, crumbly skin, thekeera vadai— an everyday snack in Sri Lanka — acquired new respect at the Ammachi café in Mannar, in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province.“I don’t add anyajinomotosalt or colouring agent. It’s justulundu[black gram], and simply ground like we do in our homes,” said P. Jayakumari, a member of the women’s crew running the eatery. “Homely” is precisely how meals served here taste. At a time when fried rice and noodles have become the most commonly available dishes in small eateries across the island, these cafes — set up in other northern districts too — have come as a boon for those looking for a tasty and healthy option.Attired in a green apron and cap, Ms. Jayakumari, like her other colleagues at the café, serves with her hands covered in disposable, transparent gloves. A tasty, hearty meal here — be it breakfast, lunch, dinner or a snack — can be had for a couple of hundreds (LKR), a bill amount that is not common in Sri Lanka, where food is among the first essentials to reflect the ever-spiralling living costs. “Can I serve some moresambar? Do you like it?” she asks each customer, ensuring swift refills as their plates get empty.Nearly 10 women from the island’s war-affected communities work full time at the cafe to support their families — in Ms. Jayakumari’s case, her husband who has a disability and their three school-going children. Each of them has a story of war-time displacement and a subsequent battle to find work in order to survive.Ms. Jayakumari was displaced to Mannar from Jaffna, while S. Jeevapushpam, who leads the group, moved to the north from the hill country, after the July 1983 anti-Tamil riots. Among the younger members, P. Ajantha, 34, has memories of life as a refugee in Mandapam, Rameswaram, and briefly in Kerala, as a little girl, before she returned home.Fresh, delectable mealsTheir open kitchen, traditional recipes and strikingly fresh meals are steadily drawing more locals and tourists. “What we cook and sell in the mornings, we do not sell in the afternoons,” Ms. Jeevapushpam explained.On a given day, depending on the time, customers get to choose from a delightful Sri Lankan menu, including hotidiyappam,appam,dosa,idli, a wholesome rice and curry meal withpappadamand fried chillies, sweets such asmodakamand tropical fruit juices. The Ammachi(grandmother) cafés, set up across the Northern Province in recent years, are modelled on theHela Bojun(local food) stalls in the south, conceived by the Department of Agriculture to employ women.“We started at a very small scale initially, setting up stalls and road-side eateries. Seeing the response, we scaled up the project in 2012. Today, it costs LKR 6 million to set up one café (roughly Rs. 24 lakh),” according to Disna Rathnasinghe, an Additional Director with the Department, and in-charge of agri-businesses. This includes infrastructure and training — currently, at least 1,000 women are employed in the cafés, including some set up by the provincial agriculture departments.At the Mannar outlet, the women work from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. and pay LKR 200 as rent per day to the department (about Rs. 78). After retrieving the costs of the ingredients, they make about LKR 300-400 a day.“If you ask me whether the profits could be higher, I’d say yes. But this is not just about the money. We come here leaving behind our worries at home. There is a sense of sisterhood and solidarity here,” Ms. Jayakumari said. “It’s very much like family, secure.”Each of the women working at Mannar’s Ammachi (grandmother) café has a story to tell, of war-time displacement and of waging a subsequent battle to find work in order to survive"

In West Bengal, row over rath yatras
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-west-bengal-row-over-rath-yatras/article25983372.ece,,https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had announced three rath yatras to cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal, has run into legal and other hurdles. The Trinamool Congress government in the State banned the rallies, citing intelligence reports that warned of communal violence in the areas that the yatras had proposed to cover.The dispute landed in the Calcutta High Court and later in the Supreme Court, which will hear the matter on January 15.Why did the BJP plan this?BJP president Amit Shah was scheduled to flag off the yatras on December 7, 2018, as a pre-election exercise. Unlike several other parts of the country, the eastern State has not seen such raths in the past, which have more to do with politics than religion.Even the rath yatra of Lal Krishna Advani in 1992 could not enter the Left Front-ruled West Bengal as it was stopped by Lalu Prasad Yadav, the then Chief Minister of neighbouring Bihar.The proposed rath yatras were an attempt to increase the party’s support base ahead of the Lok Sabha election. The BJP leadership had plans of three or four rath yatras across the State. These were strategically timed. After the 2016 Assembly election, which brought Mamata Banerjee to power for a second consecutive term, the support base of the Left parties and the Congress have slipped further, and the BJP has emerged as a contender.What is Trinamool’s stand?The Mamata Banerjee government’s decision not to grant permission to the yatras did not come as a surprise. Ms. Banerjee’s public statements calling them a means to whip up communal tensions made it clear that the State government would not give the go-ahead. Instead, the Trinamool Congress countered the BJP’s move with a plan to hold a purification (shuddhikaran) yatra. On the ground, battlelines are drawn with supporters of both parties often engaging in violence.On several occasions, the Opposition parties, including the BJP, have claimed that the Trinamool Congress government has denied them permission to hold political programmes under different pretexts. When the BJP approached the Calcutta High Court, the State government cited intelligence inputs on a possible communal flare-up.Weeks of arguments and counter-arguments over the reasonable restrictions that a State can impose and the right of a political party to hold rallies and political events failed to resolve the dispute at the High Court.Is there a shift in the narrative?Whatever be the fate of the yatras, they are indicative of what political observers call a state of “competitive communalism” in West Bengal. While a decade ago, politics in the State hinged on long-drawn agitations against forcible land acquisition that sometimes led to violence that was witnessed, for instance, at Singur and Nandigram, the yatras are indicative of a changing narrative in the State.A few months ago, the High Court was debating whether giving money to 28,000 Durga Puja committees was within the rights of the State. Those against the move argued that handing out money for Durga Puja amounted to promoting one particular religion.Prior to this, the issue of giving honorarium to imams and muezzins by the West Bengal government was challenged in court, as was the decision of not allowing immersion of idols on one particular day as it clashed with Muharram.West Bengal, which has a Muslim population of 27.01% according to the 2011 Census and which shares over a 2,000-km border with Bangladesh, is witnessing a polarised political discourse.Over the past few years, the State has seen tensions and even riots during Ram Navami, Muharram and other festivals. According to the information tabled in Parliament by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the number of communal incidents in the State rose from 27 in 2015 to 58 in 2017.Shiv Sahay Singh"

Trains towards Vijayawada, Secunderabad, Bhubaneswar and Howrah, witnessed unprecedented rush, like never before.Janmabhoomi express, which runs between Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, Simhadri, Ratnachal Express, Howrah -Yeshwantpur, Howrah Mail, Prasanthi Express, Intercity Express, were full and people were jostling for space and did not bother to stand and travel for four to five hours.Even the reserved compartments looked like general bogies, with commuters trying to find a foothold. The general compartments in several trains to Howrah were packed and passengers from Visakhapatnam were not able to enter the bogies. A number of passengers perched themselves on the luggage racks.The platforms were overcrowded and and whenever a train arrived there was a riot-like situation. For originating trains from Vizag, the railway authorities organised police security, who made the people embark into the train by organising queue.RTC bus complexMs. Sharadha, who was travelling with her two kids from Rajahmundry to Bhubaneswar in Prasanthi Express, said “We were not able to reach the washroom due to the packed crowd. All tickets were booked at least a month ago and we had to take a train as there was no other option.”Dwaraka Bus Complex witnessed a similar scene. Buses towards Rajahmundry, Vijayawada, Eluru, Srikakulam, Tekkali, Palas and Amalapuram were full. Passengers fought for seats in buses, whenever a bus halted at the platforms. And since there was no police to organise things, the scene was chaotic and women and children were the worst sufferers. Long queue lines were witnessed at the non-stop counters to Srikakulam, Narsipatnam, Annavaram, Rajahmundry. Even though the RTC officials managed to run a non-stop or single stop buses for every 10 minutes, every bus was packed.There were several altercations, as a few women argued demanding separate queue lines for them.Demand for cabsThere was a section of people, who in order to avoid stress, booked cabs to reach their destinations. The cab owners made brisk business by jacking up the rates, as most of the commuters were students, who were desperate to reach home.A student from Gayatri Vidhya Parishad, S Meghanath along with four friends, had booked a taxi to Rajahmundry. “We all are residents of Rajahmundry. Coming to know about the passenger rush in trains and buses, we booked a car from a travel agency. The driver charged on kilometre basis and it amounted to around Rs. 4,200. All five of us, shared the amount,” he said.Private buses, also doubled the price and seats available were few."

Shivpal warns Akhilesh against Mayawati ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shivpal-warns-akhilesh-against-mayawati/article25981499.ece,,https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"With Akhilesh Yadav by her side, BSP chief Mayawati on Saturday took a swipe at his estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav, saying the SP-BSP alliance had rendered useless the BJP's financial investment on him.“The money spent like water by the BJP on Shri Shivpal Yadav will surely go waste now,” said Ms. Mayawati, while addressing a joint press conference with Akhilesh Yadav.Though she claimed that the SP-BSP alliance was potent enough to stop the BJP from coming to power at the Centre in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Ms. Mayawati had a word of caution for the workers and leaders of both parties.She asked them to beware of “greedy and sold-out” parties and leaders propped up by the BJP “behind the curtains” to mislead OBCs, Dalits and Muslims as part of a conspiracy, with a special reference to Shivpal Yadav.Ms. Mayawati also asked people to choose the SP-BSP alliance, which was “holy” and based on “brotherhood”.Responding to her jibes, Shivpal Yadav, the president of the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), cautioned his nephew Akhilesh against trusting Mayawati, saying she could align with the BJP post-poll after taking the votes of OBCs, Dalits and Muslims.Referring to the BSP having formed government in UP thrice with the BJP, Shivpal Yadav said his four-decade long “struggle against communal forces” was “beyond doubt”.“It is also sad that one steeped in financial corruption and one who sells election tickets, is accusing me of taking financial support from the BJP. The top leadership of the SP should understand that even in the past Mayawati has taken the votes of Backwards, Dalits and Muslims and then gone on to sit in the lap of the BJP,” said Mr. Yadav in a statement.History could repeat itself after the election results of the 2019 Lok Sabha, he warned Akhilesh.During the press conference, while Akhilesh Yadav did not target or name his uncle, he warned his workers to stay alert from “different kinds of conspiracies” the BJP could come up with after the announcement of the alliance. The BJP could even create “an atmosphere of hate between our workers (SP and BSP) through misunderstandings and could also try to incite riots,” he said."
,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/in-west-bengal-row-over-rath-yatras/article25981051.ece,,https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had announced three rath yatras to cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal, has run into legal and other hurdles. The Trinamool Congress government in the State banned the rallies, citing intelligence reports that warned of communal violence in the areas that the yatras had proposed to cover.The dispute landed in the Calcutta High Court and later in the Supreme Court, which will hear the matter on January 15.Why did the BJP plan this?BJP president Amit Shah was scheduled to flag off the yatras on December 7, 2018, as a pre-election exercise. Unlike several other parts of the country, the eastern State has not seen such raths in the past, which have more to do with politics than religion.Even the rath yatra of Lal Krishna Advani in 1992 could not enter the Left Front-ruled West Bengal as it was stopped by Lalu Prasad Yadav, the then Chief Minister of neighbouring Bihar.The proposed rath yatras were an attempt to increase the party’s support base ahead of the Lok Sabha election. The BJP leadership had plans of three or four rath yatras across the State. These were strategically timed. After the 2016 Assembly election, which brought Mamata Banerjee to power for a second consecutive term, the support base of the Left parties and the Congress have slipped further, and the BJP has emerged as a contender.What is Trinamool’s stand?The Mamata Banerjee government’s decision not to grant permission to the yatras did not come as a surprise. Ms. Banerjee’s public statements calling them a means to whip up communal tensions made it clear that the State government would not give the go-ahead. Instead, the Trinamool Congress countered the BJP’s move with a plan to hold a purification (shuddhikaran) yatra. On the ground, battlelines are drawn with supporters of both parties often engaging in violence.On several occasions, the Opposition parties, including the BJP, have claimed that the Trinamool Congress government has denied them permission to hold political programmes under different pretexts. When the BJP approached the Calcutta High Court, the State government cited intelligence inputs on a possible communal flare-up.Weeks of arguments and counter-arguments over the reasonable restrictions that a State can impose and the right of a political party to hold rallies and political events failed to resolve the dispute at the High Court.Is there a shift in the narrative?Whatever be the fate of the yatras, they are indicative of what political observers call a state of “competitive communalism” in West Bengal. While a decade ago, politics in the State hinged on long-drawn agitations against forcible land acquisition that sometimes led to violence that was witnessed, for instance, at Singur and Nandigram, the yatras are indicative of a changing narrative in the State.A few months ago, the High Court was debating whether giving money to 28,000 Durga Puja committees was within the rights of the State. Those against the move argued that handing out money for Durga Puja amounted to promoting one particular religion.Prior to this, the issue of giving honorarium to imams and muezzins by the West Bengal government was challenged in court, as was the decision of not allowing immersion of idols on one particular day as it clashed with Muharram.West Bengal, which has a Muslim population of 27.01% according to the 2011 Census and which shares over a 2,000-km border with Bangladesh, is witnessing a polarised political discourse.Over the past few years, the State has seen tensions and even riots during Ram Navami, Muharram and other festivals. According to the information tabled in Parliament by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the number of communal incidents in the State rose from 27 in 2015 to 58 in 2017."

Four killed, including 2 firefighters, in Paris blast ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gas-explosion-rocks-central-paris-shopping-district/article25979360.ece,"
A police source said the explosion tore apart a bakery on the rue Trevise in the Grands Boulevards district. ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Four people died and nearly 50 were injured in a massive gas explosion that gutted the ground floor of a building in a central Paris shopping district on Saturday, authorities said.The accident occurred with Paris under security lockdown for a ninth consecutive Saturday of “yellow vest” protests, with large parts of the French capital blocked off by riot police.Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told reporters that two civilians and two firefighters had died of their injuries from the gas blast.“As firemen were looking for a gas leak in the building, a dramatic explosion took place,” Castaner said, adding that one of the firemen had been buried under debris for several hours.Ten people had serious but non-life threatening injuries while at least another 37 people had lighter injuries, he said.As Castaner spoke, thousands of yellow vest protesters marched noisily but peacefully through the Grands Boulevards shopping district of northern Paris, just a few hundred metres (yards) from the location of the explosion.In recent years, France has suffered a string of deadly Islamist militant attacks in Paris, Nice, Marseille and elsewhere but authorities quickly ruled out foul play.“A this stage we can say it (the gas blast) is clearly an accident,” Paris prosecutor Remi Heitz told reporters.A police source said the explosion tore apart a bakery on the rue Trevise and witnesses said the force of the blast shattered nearby storefronts and rocked buildings hundreds of metres away.More than 200 firefighters joined the rescue operation and two helicopters landed on the nearby Place de l'Opera to evacuate victims. Ambulances struggled to access the blast area because of police barriers set up to help contain any violence by yellow vest protesters.An eyewitness at a hotel nearby said he saw flames envelop the ground floor of the building blown out by the blast.“There was broken glass everywhere, storefronts were blown out and windows were shattered up to the third and fourth floors,” said 38-year-old David Bangura.He said that as he approached the scene, a woman was crying for help from the first floor of a building: “Help us, help us, we have a child”."

In Sri Lanka, serving hearty meals and fostering sisterhood

Shining in its golden-brown, crumbly skin, thekeera vadai— an everyday snack in Sri Lanka — acquired new respect at the Ammachi café in Mannar, in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province.“I don’t add anyajinomotosalt or colouring agent. It’s justulundu[black gram], and simply ground like we do in our homes,” said P. Jayakumari, a member of the women’s crew running the eatery. “Homely” is precisely how meals served here taste. At a time when fried rice and noodles have become the most commonly available dishes in small eateries across the island, these cafes — set up in other northern districts too — have come as a boon for those looking for a tasty and healthy option.Attired in a green apron and cap, Ms. Jayakumari, like her other colleagues at the café, serves with her hands covered in disposable, transparent gloves. A tasty, hearty meal here — be it breakfast, lunch, dinner or a snack — can be had for a couple of hundreds (LKR), a bill amount that is not common in Sri Lanka, where food is among the first essentials to reflect the ever-spiralling living costs. “Can I serve some moresambar? Do you like it?” she asks each customer, ensuring swift refills as their plates get empty.Nearly 10 women from the island’s war-affected communities work full time at the cafe to support their families — in Ms. Jayakumari’s case, her husband who has a disability and their three school-going children. Each of them has a story of war-time displacement and a subsequent battle to find work in order to survive.Ms. Jayakumari was displaced to Mannar from Jaffna, while S. Jeevapushpam, who leads the group, moved to the north from the hill country, after the July 1983 anti-Tamil riots. Among the younger members, P. Ajantha, 34, has memories of life as a refugee in Mandapam, Rameswaram, and briefly in Kerala, as a little girl, before she returned home.Each of the women working at Mannar’s Ammachi (grandmother) café has a story to tell, of war-time displacement and of waging a subsequent battle to find work in order to surviveFresh, delectable mealsTheir open kitchen, traditional recipes and strikingly fresh meals are steadily drawing more locals and tourists. “What we cook and sell in the mornings, we do not sell in the afternoons,” Ms. Jeevapushpam explained.On a given day, depending on the time, customers get to choose from a delightful Sri Lankan menu, including hotidiyappam,appam,dosa,idli, a wholesome rice and curry meal withpappadamand fried chillies, sweets such asmodakamand tropical fruit juices. The Ammachi(grandmother) cafés, set up across the Northern Province in recent years, are modelled on theHela Bojun(local food) stalls in the south, conceived by the Department of Agriculture to employ women.“We started at a very small scale initially, setting up stalls and road-side eateries. Seeing the response, we scaled up the project in 2012. Today, it costs LKR 6 million to set up one café (roughly ₹24 lakh),” according to Disna Rathnasinghe, an Additional Director with the Department, and in-charge of agri-businesses. This includes infrastructure and training — currently, at least 1,000 women are employed in the cafés, including some set up by the provincial agriculture departments.At the Mannar outlet, the women work from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. and pay LKR 200 as rent per day to the department (about ₹78). After retrieving the costs of the ingredients, they make about LKR 300-400 a day.“If you ask me whether the profits could be higher, I’d say yes. But this is not just about the money. We come here leaving behind our worries at home. There is a sense of sisterhood and solidarity here,” Ms. Jayakumari said. “It’s very much like family, secure.”Meera Srinivasan works for The Hindu and is based in Colombo"

Hundreds of women vendors too came out in support. They obstructed traffic and shouted slogans when the police tried to disperse them.Police fired tear gas canisters and mock bombs to quell the protestors. Two persons and O. Joyraj, sub divisisonal police officer of Imphal west district sustained injuries during the face-off. Hospital sources said the injuries weree not worrisome.Foreigners’ swamp fearManjit Sarangthem, president, All Manipur Students' Union (AMSU) said students of the Northeastern region are against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2018, since the small, indigenous population will be swamped. “Political parties should also stop confusing the situation by trading charges and countercharges,” he said.Chief Minister N. Biren, some Ministers and BJP MLAs are camping in New Delhi to meet the Prime Minister to apprise him of the developments in Manipur over the passing of the contentious bill. On Thursday the State cabinet held an emergency meeting to urge the central leaders to give President's assent to the Manipur Peoples' (Protection) Bill, 2018. The BJP-led State government says that if the Bill gets the assent, the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2018 shall not affect Manipur.Stir to continueSome agitating leaders said that they will continue the stir until the Bill is withdrawn.A large number of police personnel in riot gear are deployed in all trouble-prone areas in and around Imphal to maintain law and order.

Balakrishna Reddy of Hosur, the Madras High Court on Friday not only refused to stay his conviction by a trial court in a 1998 rioting case but also refused to suspend the sentences imposed on him.Justice V. Parthiban’s refusal to grant relief would mean that the former Minister would remain to be disqualified from being an MLA and would have to be jailed unless he approaches the Supreme Court and obtains an order in his favour.The judge, however, kept pending an appeal preferred by him challenging the trial court’s verdict and directed the High Court Registry to list it for final hearing in the first week of February. The appellant had taken frantic efforts to get the conviction stayed so that he could escape from disqualification.According to the Supreme Court’s judgment delivered on September 26 in a case filed by Lok Prahari, a non governmental organisation, the disqualification under Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act (RPA) of 1951 would not come into operation if an appellate court stays the conviction.Though this judgment was cited before Mr. Justice Parthiban, he wondered where was the question of staying the conviction when he was not even inclined to suspend the sentences. The case against the appellant was that he was part of a mob that torched police vehicles and damaged government buses at Bagalur village in Krishnagiri district 20 years ago.A special court hearing cases related to members of Parliament and that of the Legislative Assembly convicted him in the two-decade-old case on Monday.He was also sentenced to three years of imprisonment forcing him to resign from ministership on the same day because as per the RPA, every MLA who gets convicted and sentenced to more than two years of imprisonment would get disqualified from the date of conviction and would remain so for a further period of six years from the date of his release.Stating that the appellant had brought upon himself the present predicament, the judge said: “Though today, the society does not expect saints in public life due to progressive erosion of traditional values and ethos, it can at least hope to look forward to have tolerant and saner persons with decorus conduct in public life.“Only then the public at large would feel that they are being governed by men of stature. Since politics is all pervading in our society, people always look upon the leaders for guidance and inspiration and if such leaders are involved in mindless violence, the democratic polity gets defiled.”The appellant may not have been an MLA in 1998 “but what he had done, which was proved in the trial court, was an affront to the rule of law. This court is unable to comprehend as to how a yesteryear law breaker can claim to continue as law framer,” the judge said."

Reverence, relevance, restoration
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/reverence-relevance-restoration/article25976948.ece,"
A century-old residence gets a makeover, yet retains its glory at the hands of architect Husna Rahaman who deftly plays with hues and patterns. By Nandhini Sundar
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When faced with a century-old residence or even one that is half the age, the immediate reaction is to demolish and develop the site or build a fabulous contemporary dwelling, money and space permitting. Restoring such a building to its former glory is beyond the radar, especially given the economics behind such an initiative. The state of the structure and the lifestyle the interior facilities offer, further promote this inclination.Yet, one such stately colonial residence came up, not for being rebuilt, but for restoration, keeping intact the fibre of the structure while infusing just the right level of contemporary comforts.When architect Husna Rahaman of Fulcrum Studio was given the century-old sprawling 7,000 sq. ft colonial home for restoration, the structure essentially a no-nonsense load-bearing piece of engineering that cannot be tampered with on whim, she realised that strategic alterations, if any, could happen only where absolutely necessary.The entire restoration thus occurred on a delicate balance of reverence and relevance, the regal aura retained while the modern functional quotient was brought in where relevant.Profusion of hues, patternsIn tune with the era it related to, the residence came with its accompanying hues and patterns that literally saturated the spaces, the patterned antique floor and wall tiles engulfing the ambience. Without shunning this past grandeur, Rahaman set about managing deftly the play of hues and patterns where they would enchant and refresh, without submerging the senses.“It was literally a riot of colours and this base was used as a spring board to complement the residence where it is not eliminated but used to balance”, she explains. Keeping this intent in perspective, an elegant network of wood verticals and horizontals were brought in to frame the length and breadth of the expansive living area. A new set of chandeliers were added, yet the design of these were kept deliberately colonial in keeping with the structure.The rich flooring was retained, along with the porcelain tile dadoing on the walls, both in the living area as well as rest of the residence. A refreshing contemporary twist was brought into the space by introducing metal motifs on the walls, the motifs reflecting the existing patterns. While the walls and ceiling continue to accommodate the wooden columns and beams, a reminder of the colonial past, the contemporary flavour wafts into the spaces through concealed lights and metal motifs.Contemporary upgradeThe living area reveals the presence of two groups of furniture, each connected by a large back-to-back sofa cluster. The unusual blend of materials and styles seen in the living area and carried methodically into the rest of the residence, where luxury is paired with minimalism and exquisite Indian crafts tie in seamlessly with streamlined forms, reveals a reverential contemporary upgrade of a glorious past.While the strong imperial character of the structure has been reverentially retained, the spaces have been infused with warmth to address the home it ultimately is. This has been successfully achieved through application of soft roses on the walls, neutral colours with subtle pops of colour in the rugs, strips of wallpaper and cushions in shades of pink and orange.Likewise, the spatial poetry of the house, an element lacking in modern crowded structures, has been preserved to integrate the multiple rooms, where the past meets the present, opening the spaces to surreal vistas.Infusing metalGiven the era of the residence, metal does not figure in its construction. Yet, a contemporary twist has been brought in by infusing metal craftily into the stately space, lightening the palette. The floral medallion in the living area serves as a symbolic confluence of the metallic motifs used in the rest of the residence. Metal also features as an artistic railing for the staircase, replacing the previous cement and brick staircase. The terrace further reveals a stunning dark grey metal gazebo to unwind and relax, besides serving as an entertainment zone when need arises.Sun roomThe first level of the building came with narrow spaces, yet the interiors were filled with abundant natural light. Rahaman decided to capture this effectively to create a sunny library. “The room came with its quota of colours and patterns like the rest of the house and the space was converted into a turquoise library with a western exposure by merely introducing rugs into the space.”The ‘sun room’ reveals rugs in intense hues of ochre and turquoise blue, soaked in geometric patterns where they define the floor, with the turquoise blue and wood verticals on the walls complementing the same. Vibrant in conception, the space greets with a burst of exuberance, the twin daybeds created between the columns further enhancing with their presence."

Here are some of the best and worst trends we witnessed
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"While the 2018 Golden Globes red carpet saw most actresses dressed in black gowns in support of the Time’s Up movement, lending their solidarity to victims of sexual assault and harassment, the red carpet at this edition held on Monday morning, was a riot of luscious colours and interesting silhouettes for the most part.HITSNude MoodKristen Bell’s Zuhair Murad gown that had a plunging neckline wowed onlookers, but it was Constance Wu who wore the nude trend best in her custom Vera Wang ball gown. With noodle straps and a sheer bodice, her floor-length tulle skirt featuring an attractive orange velvet bow, made her look like a princess straight out of a classic fairy-tale.Blue’s the hueIf there’s one celeb who took the cornflower blue game to the next level in her Valentino gown, it had to be Lady Gaga. Dramatic, thanks to those exaggerated sleeves, her blue hair complemented her outfit perfectly, as did her jewellery. Giving out that edgy yet soft vibe was Alison Brie’s Vera Wang number. Everything about her outfit was top class, from the pastel blue tulle and a ball gown skirt to the peek-a-boo styled embellished bodice. Another winner in the category was Yvonne Strahovski who donned a custom strapless silk chiffon Alberta Ferretti design in a gorgeous seafoam hue.Pantsuit FTWIt can be rather tricky to play around with those half-pant, half-skirt outfits. You either make a fashion statement or go down in the records for being among the worst dressed, but trust an A-lister like Julia Roberts to flaunt the trend effortlessly and ever so stylishly. We couldn’t help but fall in love with her black and tan Stella McCartney ensemble that featured a single-shouldered bodice in a shimmering tan shade. The black tailored pants were stitched to perfection as was the tan tulle skirt behind it. Her Chopard jewellery and side swept wavy hairstyle added to her overall getup.Think PinkEmma Stone is almost always a winner when it comes to nailing red carpet looks. This year was no exception. She looked flawless in a pale pink Louis Vuitton Atelier gown that supposedly took 30 embroiderers over 800 hours to craft. Intricate twisted glass tubes were used to create the gown&#39;s scale-like pattern. Kiki Layne also looked stunning in an off-shouldered pale pink Dior design. The tulle sleeve detailing was a hit as was the blush tulle skirt and the unique corset. We also adored Emmy Rossum whose Monique Lhuillier ball gown was a show stopper.Sparkle and ShineSequins and beads are a given at the Golden Globes. And “Bohemian Rhapsody” actress, Lucy Boynton, glimmered in a chic gold gown. With that plunging neck-line, thigh-high slit that showed off her long legs, and the bishop sleeved detailing, she was a vision on the red carpet.Lupita Nyong’o has always been our favourite on the red carpet. Her deep purple beaded Calvin Klein by Appointment gown was ethereal. Steering away from the typical gold and silver was Regina King who dazzled in a well-structured strapless rose gold gown by Alberta Ferretti.MISSESCape or Drape?We aren’t sure what Lucy Liu was thinking when she stepped out wearing that disastrous Galia Lahav cross between a dress and cape. The one-shouldered outfit in that nude shade and neon coloured embellishments, unnecessarily veiled by a see through floor-length cape draped over the front, didn’t quite impress anyone, nor did her neutral makeup. Looks like she walked away with the worst dressed award. Glenn Close stole the show with that stellar speech after her win, but though her Armani Privé dress wasn’t too bad, somehow that black cape like outfit had the least appealing silhouette. Julianne Moore&#39;s Givenchy gown was super boring. The white dress that highlighted a halter-style neckline, an outlandish cut-out below the waist and a cape-like detail behind, was easily among the worst choice of outfits for the night.Leopard Print LoathingAnne Hathaway has a way of winning our hearts most of the time with her sensible and unique fashion choices so it was rather disheartening to see her sashay down the red carpet in that hideous sequinned leopard print number from Elie Saab. Looks like she needs to hire a new stylist!Burgundy BlunderDon’t get us wrong. We absolutely love the colour but we detest the way some A-listers wore it on the red carpet. She was the belle of the ball last year, but this season, Nicole Kidman failed to make a statement in that extremely fitted Michael Kors gown. With the high neckline, long sleeves, and way too many sequins, it looked rather suffocating for her as well as for those who had to see her. Another let down came in the form of Caitriona Balfe’s custom made Moschino burgundy design that also had black velvet on it. The colours and the textures were fine but what was with the pleated bodice and that horrible silhouette that did nothing to accentuate her hips in the right manner? Halle Berry ‘s Zuhair Murad gown had too much going on. Again, we loved the colour on her but the stripes all over, long sleeves, ruffled detail, and broad belt just didn’t work for her or us, for that matter!Mundane in MonochromeThere’s nothing to dislike about monochrome if the overall look is sleek and stylish but then we saw Rachel Weisz whose black and white off-shouldered confection had way too many ruffles on the top and a then a fitted bottom half. Amber Heard has never really won the best dressed award and she might not ever make the cut. Her Monique Lhuillier dress was rather perplexing. What started with a black tailored, strapless bodice broke into a white gigantic ball gown skirt.Leave me be, said the LBDShort dresses are chic but definitely not on the red carpet. However, it looks like Elisabeth Moss doesn’t quite agree. Hers was a rather forgettable look as she wore a strapless Christian Dior mini dress to one of the biggest events hosted by the industry.Off to prom, are we?Jameela Jamil did look pretty in that strapless coral ensemble but outfit but most of the important folk in the fashion fraternity felt like this was a throwback to one’s senior prom, thanks to her full skirt dress that featured strangely positioned floral flourishes."

2019 Golden Globes: Here are some of the best and worst dressed celebrities ",https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/2019-golden-globes-here-are-some-of-the-best-and-worst-dressed-celebrities/article25950341.ece,,https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"While the 2018 Golden Globes red carpet saw most actresses dressed in black gowns in support of the Time’s Up movement, lending their solidarity to victims of sexual assault and harassment, the red carpet at this edition held on Monday morning, was a riot of luscious colours and interesting silhouettes for the most part.HITSNude MoodKristen Bell’s Zuhair Murad gown that had a plunging neckline wowed onlookers, but it was Constance Wu who wore the nude trend best in her custom Vera Wang ball gown. With noodle straps and a sheer bodice, her floor-length tulle skirt featuring an attractive orange velvet bow, made her look like a princess straight out of a classic fairy-tale.Blue’s the hueIf there’s one celeb who took the cornflower blue game to the next level in her Valentino gown, it had to be Lady Gaga. Dramatic, thanks to those exaggerated sleeves, her blue hair complemented her outfit perfectly, as did her jewellery. Giving out that edgy yet soft vibe was Alison Brie’s Vera Wang number. Everything about her outfit was top class, from the pastel blue tulle and a ball gown skirt to the peek-a-boo styled embellished bodice. Another winner in the category was Yvonne Strahovski who donned a custom strapless silk chiffon Alberta Ferretti design in a gorgeous seafoam hue.Pantsuit FTWIt can be rather tricky to play around with those half-pant, half-skirt outfits. You either make a fashion statement or go down in the records for being among the worst dressed, but trust an A-lister like Julia Roberts to flaunt the trend effortlessly and ever so stylishly. We couldn’t help but fall in love with her black and tan Stella McCartney ensemble that featured a single-shouldered bodice in a shimmering tan shade. The black tailored pants were stitched to perfection as was the tan tulle skirt behind it. Her Chopard jewellery and side swept wavy hairstyle added to her overall getup.Think PinkEmma Stone is almost always a winner when it comes to nailing red carpet looks. This year was no exception. She looked flawless in a pale pink Louis Vuitton Atelier gown that supposedly took 30 embroiderers over 800 hours to craft. Intricate twisted glass tubes were used to create the gown&#39;s scale-like pattern. Kiki Layne also looked stunning in an off-shouldered pale pink Dior design. The tulle sleeve detailing was a hit as was the blush tulle skirt and the unique corset. We also adored Emmy Rossum whose Monique Lhuillier ball gown was a show stopper.Sparkle and ShineSequins and beads are a given at the Golden Globes. And “Bohemian Rhapsody” actress, Lucy Boynton, glimmered in a chic gold gown. With that plunging neck-line, thigh-high slit that showed off her long legs, and the bishop sleeved detailing, she was a vision on the red carpet.Lupita Nyong’o has always been our favourite on the red carpet. Her deep purple beaded Calvin Klein by Appointment gown was ethereal. Steering away from the typical gold and silver was Regina King who dazzled in a well-structured strapless rose gold gown by Alberta Ferretti.MISSESCape or Drape?We aren’t sure what Lucy Liu was thinking when she stepped out wearing that disastrous Galia Lahav cross between a dress and cape. The one-shouldered outfit in that nude shade and neon coloured embellishments, unnecessarily veiled by a see through floor-length cape draped over the front, didn’t quite impress anyone, nor did her neutral makeup. Looks like she walked away with the worst dressed award. Glenn Close stole the show with that stellar speech after her win, but though her Armani Privé dress wasn’t too bad, somehow that black cape like outfit had the least appealing silhouette. Julianne Moore&#39;s Givenchy gown was super boring. The white dress that highlighted a halter-style neckline, an outlandish cut-out below the waist and a cape-like detail behind, was easily among the worst choice of outfits for the night.Leopard Print LoathingAnne Hathaway has a way of winning our hearts most of the time with her sensible and unique fashion choices so it was rather disheartening to see her sashay down the red carpet in that hideous sequinned leopard print number from Elie Saab. Looks like she needs to hire a new stylist!Burgundy BlunderDon’t get us wrong. We absolutely love the colour but we detest the way some A-listers wore it on the red carpet. She was the belle of the ball last year, but this season, Nicole Kidman failed to make a statement in that extremely fitted Michael Kors gown. With the high neckline, long sleeves, and way too many sequins, it looked rather suffocating for her as well as for those who had to see her. Another let down came in the form of Caitriona Balfe’s custom made Moschino burgundy design that also had black velvet on it. The colours and the textures were fine but what was with the pleated bodice and that horrible silhouette that did nothing to accentuate her hips in the right manner? Halle Berry ‘s Zuhair Murad gown had too much going on. Again, we loved the colour on her but the stripes all over, long sleeves, ruffled detail, and broad belt just didn’t work for her or us, for that matter!Mundane in MonochromeThere’s nothing to dislike about monochrome if the overall look is sleek and stylish but then we saw Rachel Weisz whose black and white off-shouldered confection had way too many ruffles on the top and a then a fitted bottom half. Amber Heard has never really won the best dressed award and she might not ever make the cut. Her Monique Lhuillier dress was rather perplexing. What started with a black tailored, strapless bodice broke into a white gigantic ball gown skirt.Leave me be, said the LBDShort dresses are chic but definitely not on the red carpet. However, it looks like Elisabeth Moss doesn’t quite agree. Hers was a rather forgettable look as she wore a strapless Christian Dior mini dress to one of the biggest events hosted by the industry.Off to prom, are we?Jameela Jamil did look pretty in that strapless coral ensemble but outfit but most of the important folk in the fashion fraternity felt like this was a throwback to one’s senior prom, thanks to her full skirt dress that featured strangely positioned floral flourishes."

Says Narendra Modi will be PM again after general election
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Bihar Chief Minister and NDA ally Nitish Kumar on Monday emphatically asserted that the country could only be run by the Constitution and that there was no question of compromising on crime, corruption and communalism.Mr. Kumar also declared that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would continue in the position and the NDA will return to power in the coming general election.“The country will only be run by the Constitution,” Mr. Kumar said, replying to a question by media persons on whether the country would be run by faith or by the Constitution. “The Ram Mandir issue could be resolved either by peaceful and consensual dialogue between two communities or by the court. As far as the Rafale deal is concerned, much debate on the issue has taken place in Parliament and the Supreme Court too has given its decision on it. The triple talaq issue should be left to people of that community to decide among themselves,” Mr. Kumar said when asked for comments on the controversial issues. He, however, avoided any direct comment on the Sabarimala temple entry controversy.On the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, Mr. Kumar said that the Central government should talk to the Asom Gana Parishad whose delegation had met him earlier. ""We believe that the feeling of the people of Assam must be respected as they have their own identity,” he said.The Chief Minister said that the NDA government both at the Centre and in the State had been running smoothly and working for development.“I would request the media to focus on development work going on in Bihar as well,” he told reporters on the sidelines of his weekly ‘Lok Samvad’ interaction with the people.Asked about the prospects of a ‘mahagathbandhan’ (grand alliance) of opposition parties, Mr. Kumar said that he didn’t see any future for it. “I don’t see them putting any challenge to us in the upcoming general election.”Reacting to questions on the recent incidents of mob lynching and a spurt in crimes in the State, Mr. Kumar asserted that his government would never compromise on three issues: crime, corruption and communalism. “In my 13 years of regime only once there was a curfew clamped in Nawada district, otherwise not a single incident of riot happened in the State. But these days a new word 'mob lynching' has come up. What can we do from here [Patna] if villagers catch hold of someone for theft at 11 p.m. and do something?” he asked.‘What about scams?’Leader of the Opposition in the State Tejashwi Yadav slammed the Chief Minister for his comments. “You say your government cannot compromise on corruption but what about the 36 scams that happened during your regime, including the Srijan scam,” the RJD leader asked.“Nitish Kumar adopts double standards,” said Mr. Yadav, who received a setback on Monday when a bench of the Patna High Court dismissed his petition challenging the State government’s order asking him to vacate his official bungalow.“Still, options are open and I’ll approach the Supreme Court against this order,” he said."

The great leveller: How Urdu blossomed in the 19th century ",https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-great-leveller/article25929519.ece,"
How Urdu blossomed in the 19th century when the king, the poet and the common man articulated their thoughts in the rich language ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Delhi and Urdu have been entwined in an all-embracing affair right from the time of Aurangzeb, when poets of “Zaban-e-Goya” or the language par excellence began to emerge, though the initial foundation was laid by Amir Khusrau in the mid-13th century, when he advocated Hindavi, a mixture of the local idiom, Persian and Arabic. After a long journey of nearly six centuries, Urdu flowered in the 19th century when, to quote littérateur Rakshanda Jalil, “Everybody from the king down to the impoverished vagrant singing in the koochas and bazaars was smitten with poetry”. Even the koonjars who sold vegetables were infected by the scenario and sing-songed their wares with “latkas” or jingo rhymes like “Laila-ki-pasliyan” (the ideal Persian beloved’s ribs) and “Majnu-ki-ugliyan” (fingers of her passionate lover). All this is brought out beautifully in Saif Mahmood’s recently-released book, “Beloved Delhi”.Then came the First War of Independence in 1857 and the twilight of the Mughals, who were the enthusiastic patrons of Urdu, with Bahadur Shah Zafar himself emerging as a shair of pessimistic verse that portrayed both his plight and that of the shabby grandeur of the once exalted “Qila-e-Mualla” into which his kingdom had shrunk after its capture by the British East India Company. That annus horribilis became so volatile that the poets could only decry the cataclysmic events that had changed their lives and the fortunes of their city forever. This was naturally reflected in heart-wrenching verse.But even before that, says Rakshanda, “there existed a body of poetry known as Sher-Ashobor or misfortunes of Delhi on the social decline and in turmoil, portrayed by Jafar Zaatalli (1658-1713), encompassing virtually the entire reign of Aurangzeb. Zaatelli’s criticism of the decadent Mughals angered Emperor Farrukhsiyar so much that he sentenced him to death. The crumbling social order later found an echo in the works of Hatim, Sauda and Mir Taqi Mir, the best chroniclers of the plight of Delhi in verse.They were in a way carrying on the traditional journey of Hindavi of Khusrau out of Delhi – “From battlefields, camps, shrines, marketplaces and work sites to night-shelters or caravanserais”, where the weary traveller could find both refuge, with board and lodging, and an outlet for his merchandise. The poets who epitomised this owed a debt of gratitude to Amir Khusrau, the best known exponent of Hindavi that unfortunately got divided into Hindi and Urdu. Both shair and sufi used Ram as a synonym for God, which was also adopted by Nanak and Kabir and made Daadoo Dayal, the 16th Century Bhakti poet of Gujarat exclaim, “He who doesn’t oppress or consume what is prohibited is a Momin (Believer) and will go to heaven”.Genesis of qawwaliOne side-product of Khusrau’s Hindavi was the birth of qawwali, derived from the word “Qaul” of Hazrat Muhammad and adopted at the khanqahs of the sufis – the Chistis, Suhrawardis, Naqsbandis and Qadris - that affected Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti’s chief disciple, Qutubuddin Bakhtiar Kaki’s spiritual heir, Baba Fareed so much that he took great pains to popularise it in Punjab, after that it spread throughout Hindustan and now abroad too.Braj was the language most widely spoken in the long-time Mughal capital Agra before Delhi became the seat of the empire with Persian as the court language at both places. “But it was a voice from the Deccan that changed this radically. The man who brought this about was Wali Dakhni, who came to Delhi in 1700 AD while Aurangzeb was still on the throne. Delhi was at that time home to several eminent poets of Persian, Hatim, Abroo, Arzoo and Bedil among them, who swore by the Persian poetry of Saadi, Hafiz, Jami, Khaqani and Urfi. It was in this milieu that Wali Dakhni introduced his poetry, written in Dakhani, called Rekhta (language of the marketplace) that became Urdu as we know it today. Mir and Hatim who mostly wrote in Persian earlier, took to Rekhta too. Incidentally, the mazar of Wali Dakhni was razed during the Gujarat riots of 2002 and a road built on the site overnight as though that could diminish the enormous literary contribution of Wali.In 1713 was born Mohammad Rafi Sauda, who has come to be known as Mughal Delhi’s first classical Urdu poet. The city’s Urdu, however, had an atypical flavour, different from its Awadhi or Deccani sisters. Before Sauda it was Sheikh Zahuruddin (1699-1792), later known by his takhalus (pen-name) Hatim, who patronised the new trend. He was followed, besides Sauda, by Mir Dard, Mir Taqi Mir, Zauq, Ghalib, Momin and Nawab Mirza Daagh Dehlvi, the Casanova of Urdu poetry. Daagh later migrated to Rampur and then to Hyderabad, where he died in 1905 at the age of 74, making his pupil Benjamin Montrose “Muztar”, an Indo-Scot, cry out in anguish : “Ek Daagh tha so who bhi tau Muztar guzar gaya/Baqi bacha hai kuan ab Hindostan mein”.Adopting simple dictionDaagh, commented Pandit Anand Mohan Zutshi, better known as Gulzar Dehlvi, was the one who made Ghalib what he was. Initially, Ghalib used to write difficult verse that did not find much admirers but then he noticed the popularity of Daagh because of his simple diction and adopted the same style. Incidentally, Daagh’s mother, Wazir Khanum, alias Chhoti Begum, “who had an eye for men”, married Marston Blake, an English officer at the age of 16 and had two children from him. Blake was unfortunately killed in a riot in Jaipur in early 1880.The begum’s later admirers were the Nawab of Loharu, Nawab Shamsuddin Khan of Firozepore Jhirka and the British Resident at the Mughal court, William Fraser. She married Shamsuddin Khan, who fathered Nawab Mirza Khan Daagh Dehlvi. Shamsuddin was later hanged for complicity in the murder of Fraser, while Wazir Khanum wed her third husband, Turab Ali. She finally married Mirza Fakru, Bahadur Shah Zafar’s son and died after him in 1879, leaving Daagh disconsolate."

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday vowed to “mercilessly suppress” what he described as the attempt by the BJP and RSS to foment communal trouble in Kerala.In a strongly worded public post on his Facebook account, Mr. Vijayan said the well-rehearsed trick of the Sangh Parivar to reap political dividend by causing a schism between communities in the name of religion would not work in Kerala.The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government would not cower in fear in front of any threat, he said.Also ReadCentre seeks report from Kerala on Sabarimala violenceThe CM’s comment came close on the heels of the reported “threat” by Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Irani, that the Kerala government would face dire “constitutional consequences” if it pursued its “anti-faith” agenda in Sabarimala.Some quarters also construed the CM's comment as a riposte to Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair, who had blamed the government earlier in the day for “unleashing anarchy” in Kerala by mishandling the Sabarimala controversy.The CM said that the government had implemented the Supreme Court verdict which said men and women had equal rights when it came to matters of faith. The government had met its constitutional obligation.The forces that threatened the Kerala government with dire consequences for upholding the law were those that were inimical to the constitution and the rule of law, he said.He blamed the RSS and BJP for the violence in Kerala. They had conspired to illegally upend the implementation of the SC order to sow chaos in the State. Their ploys would fail.

How Urdu blossomed in the 19th century when the king, the poet and the common man articulated their thoughts in the rich language
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Delhi and Urdu have been entwined in an all-embracing affair right from the time of Aurangzeb, when poets of “Zaban-e-Goya” or the language par excellence began to emerge, though the initial foundation was laid by Amir Khusrau in the mid-13th century, when he advocated Hindavi, a mixture of the local idiom, Persian and Arabic. After a long journey of nearly six centuries, Urdu flowered in the 19th century when, to quote littérateur Rakshanda Jalil, “Everybody from the king down to the impoverished vagrant singing in the koochas and bazaars was smitten with poetry”. Even the koonjars who sold vegetables were infected by the scenario and sing-songed their wares with “latkas” or jingo rhymes like “Laila-ki-pasliyan” (the ideal Persian beloved’s ribs) and “Majnu-ki-ugliyan” (fingers of her passionate lover). All this is brought out beautifully in Saif Mahmood’s recently-released book, “Beloved Delhi”.Then came the First War of Independence in 1857 and the twilight of the Mughals, who were the enthusiastic patrons of Urdu, with Bahadur Shah Zafar himself emerging as a shair of pessimistic verse that portrayed both his plight and that of the shabby grandeur of the once exalted “Qila-e-Mualla” into which his kingdom had shrunk after its capture by the British East India Company. That annus horribilis became so volatile that the poets could only decry the cataclysmic events that had changed their lives and the fortunes of their city forever. This was naturally reflected in heart-wrenching verse.But even before that, says Rakshanda, “there existed a body of poetry known as Sher-Ashobor or misfortunes of Delhi on the social decline and in turmoil, portrayed by Jafar Zaatalli (1658-1713), encompassing virtually the entire reign of Aurangzeb. Zaatelli’s criticism of the decadent Mughals angered Emperor Farrukhsiyar so much that he sentenced him to death. The crumbling social order later found an echo in the works of Hatim, Sauda and Mir Taqi Mir, the best chroniclers of the plight of Delhi in verse.They were in a way carrying on the traditional journey of Hindavi of Khusrau out of Delhi – “From battlefields, camps, shrines, marketplaces and work sites to night-shelters or caravanserais”, where the weary traveller could find both refuge, with board and lodging, and an outlet for his merchandise. The poets who epitomised this owed a debt of gratitude to Amir Khusrau, the best known exponent of Hindavi that unfortunately got divided into Hindi and Urdu. Both shair and sufi used Ram as a synonym for God, which was also adopted by Nanak and Kabir and made Daadoo Dayal, the 16th Century Bhakti poet of Gujarat exclaim, “He who doesn’t oppress or consume what is prohibited is a Momin (Believer) and will go to heaven”.Genesis of qawwaliOne side-product of Khusrau’s Hindavi was the birth of qawwali, derived from the word “Qaul” of Hazrat Muhammad and adopted at the khanqahs of the sufis – the Chistis, Suhrawardis, Naqsbandis and Qadris - that affected Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti’s chief disciple, Qutubuddin Bakhtiar Kaki’s spiritual heir, Baba Fareed so much that he took great pains to popularise it in Punjab, after that it spread throughout Hindustan and now abroad too.Braj was the language most widely spoken in the long-time Mughal capital Agra before Delhi became the seat of the empire with Persian as the court language at both places. “But it was a voice from the Deccan that changed this radically. The man who brought this about was Wali Dakhni, who came to Delhi in 1700 AD while Aurangzeb was still on the throne. Delhi was at that time home to several eminent poets of Persian, Hatim, Abroo, Arzoo and Bedil among them, who swore by the Persian poetry of Saadi, Hafiz, Jami, Khaqani and Urfi. It was in this milieu that Wali Dakhni introduced his poetry, written in Dakhani, called Rekhta (language of the marketplace) that became Urdu as we know it today. Mir and Hatim who mostly wrote in Persian earlier, took to Rekhta too. Incidentally, the mazar of Wali Dakhni was razed during the Gujarat riots of 2002 and a road built on the site overnight as though that could diminish the enormous literary contribution of Wali.In 1713 was born Mohammad Rafi Sauda, who has come to be known as Mughal Delhi’s first classical Urdu poet. The city’s Urdu, however, had an atypical flavour, different from its Awadhi or Deccani sisters. Before Sauda it was Sheikh Zahuruddin (1699-1792), later known by his takhalus (pen-name) Hatim, who patronised the new trend. He was followed, besides Sauda, by Mir Dard, Mir Taqi Mir, Zauq, Ghalib, Momin and Nawab Mirza Daagh Dehlvi, the Casanova of Urdu poetry. Daagh later migrated to Rampur and then to Hyderabad, where he died in 1905 at the age of 74, making his pupil Benjamin Montrose “Muztar”, an Indo-Scot, cry out in anguish : “Ek Daagh tha so who bhi tau Muztar guzar gaya/Baqi bacha hai kuan ab Hindostan mein”.Adopting simple dictionDaagh, commented Pandit Anand Mohan Zutshi, better known as Gulzar Dehlvi, was the one who made Ghalib what he was. Initially, Ghalib used to write difficult verse that did not find much admirers but then he noticed the popularity of Daagh because of his simple diction and adopted the same style. Incidentally, Daagh’s mother, Wazir Khanum, alias Chhoti Begum, “who had an eye for men”, married Marston Blake, an English officer at the age of 16 and had two children from him. Blake was unfortunately killed in a riot in Jaipur in early 1880.The begum’s later admirers were the Nawab of Loharu, Nawab Shamsuddin Khan of Firozepore Jhirka and the British Resident at the Mughal court, William Fraser. She married Shamsuddin Khan, who fathered Nawab Mirza Khan Daagh Dehlvi. Shamsuddin was later hanged for complicity in the murder of Fraser, while Wazir Khanum wed her third husband, Turab Ali. She finally married Mirza Fakru, Bahadur Shah Zafar’s son and died after him in 1879, leaving Daagh disconsolate."

Open encouragement to unleash lawlessness: Minister
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran has said that the position of the Nair Service Society (NSS) on Sabarimala tantamount to an open encouragement of those elements seeking to unleash lawlessness in the State in the name of religion and faith.Reacting to NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair’s statement blaming the government for the recent rioting following the entry of two young women to the temple early last Wednesday, Mr. Surendran asked the social organisation to desist from helping the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its divisive agenda.He said the Sabarimala Karma Samithi (SKS) was a political construct of the RSS and the Hindu Aikya Vedi. The NSS had failed to view the Sabarimala issue objectively. The government was constitutionally bound to uphold the Supreme Court order allowing entry of women, irrespective of their age, to the temple. He said the government had no hidden agenda. It had not tried to impose an atheist agenda on anybody. The government had only attempted to remind the State about the Enlightenment values that transformed Kerala from a medieval State into a modern one.The State had reaped dividends of the social reformation, and secular society should protect the core principles of the movement that involved people of all faiths.The Tantri of Sabarimala temple had violated the order of the Supreme Court (SC) by holding a purification ritual following the entry of two women. His action tantamount to the practice of untouchability, a cruel tradition banned by law, Mr. Surendran said.CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan echoed Mr. Surendran’s sentiments and said the NSS statement appeared supportive of rioters who wreaked havoc in the State in the name of entry of women to Sabarimala.CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran said the NSS appeared to have forsaken its stated policy of equidistance from political alignments in support of revanchist forces."

Says govt. will not cower in fear to threat
",,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday vowed to “mercilessly suppress” what he described as the attempt by the BJP and RSS to foment communal trouble in Kerala.In a strongly worded public post on his Facebook account, Mr. Vijayan said the well-rehearsed trick of the Sangh Parivar to reap political dividend by creating a schism between communities in the name of religion would not pass muster in Kerala.The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government would not cower in fear in front of any threat.Threat by Union MinisterThe Chief Minister’s comment came close on the heels of the reported “threat” by Union Minister of Textiles Smriti Irani that the Kerala government would face dire “constitutional consequences” if it pursued its “anti-faith” agenda in Sabarimala.Some quarters also construed the Chief Minister’s comment as a riposte to Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair who had blamed the government earlier in the day for “unleashing anarchy” in Kerala by mishandling the Sabarimala issue.The Chief Minister said the government had implemented the Supreme Court verdict, which said men and women had equal rights when it came to matters of faith.The government had met its constitutional obligation, he said.‘Inimical to rule of law’The forces that threatened Kerala Government with dire consequences for upholding the law were those that were inimical to the Constitution and the rule of law, he said.He blamed the RSS and BJP for the violence in Kerala.They had conspired to illegally upend the implementation of the Supreme Court order to create chaos in the State.Their ploy would fail. The Kerala police had no political colour and had prosecuted persons responsible for the rioting, irrespective of their party affiliations, the Chief Minister said.The comment comes close on the heels of the reported “threat” by Union Minister Smriti Irani that Kerala would face dire “constitutional consequences.”"

Police continue mass arrests of persons suspected to be responsible for violence
",,"The Kerala police on Sunday continued its mass round-ups of persons suspected to be responsible for the spree of violence that engulfed the State for nearly four days after two young women worshipped at the Sabarimala temple early Wednesday.Officers said the State was mostly peaceful on Sunday, but certain pockets of disquiet remained. In Thalassery, BJP and CPI(M) workers targeted each other's homes in violation of a peace agreement brokered by the District Collector.The police have so far arrested 5,397 persons, an overwhelming number of them Bharatiya Janata Party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) workers.The police produced 731 persons in court and remanded them in judicial custody.The charges against them included the attack on police officers, destruction of public property, illegal use of explosives, arson and wilful rioting.The rest arrested on lesser charges of unlawful assembly and violation of curfew were let off on bail from station houses. So far, the police have registered 1,771 cases in connection with Sabarimala-related violence.Senior officers said they were pursuing a “broken windows” policing strategy.The approach entailed the identification and detention of persons involved in even very minor offences to interdict the re-occurrence of major crimes such as the organised rioting the State witnessed after the Sabarimala issue erupted again last week.The BJP has slammed the police strategy stating that it unfairly targeted those politically opposed to the CPI(M). The government has used the police to burden Ayyappa devotees with criminal cases, which will make it harder for them to procure passports and get security clearance for jobs.A senior officer said the police had acted only on the basis of evidence. It had used conventional methods for evidence collection and artificial intelligence-powered software programme to single out and identify habitual rioters caught on surveillance cameras across the State.At Perambra in Kozhikode, the police said they arrested a CPI(M) branch secretary on the charge of attacking the place of worship of a minority community in a bid to foment communal trouble and create enmity between communities.They have named 20 CPI(M) workers as accused in the case registered under Section 153 (a) of the IPC. At Attappady and Pattambi in Palakkad, the police arrested seven CPI(M) workers in connection with the attacks on the house of BJP workers. The police have arraigned scores of CPI(M) workers as accused in cases relating to the attack on BJP workers, their homes and party offices.The continuing use of crude explosives has prompted an intense crackdown on the illegal sale of explosives. Officers said in Kannur, both the BJP and CPI(M) had used lethal thrown-down type country bombs encased in steel casings to attack the houses of party leaders. In other places, the rioters had mostly used bangers, which were relatively non-lethal and contained no explosives."

Mischief is the name of the game as vacations spell boredom ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The croutons reminded me of tiny rafts floating in a pond. I sprinkled a dash of pepper very precisely on a crouton, pretending it was a bunch of people on the precarious raft. Finally, my grumbling stomach got the better of me, and I wolfed down the soup, croutons, and everything else in the bowl.I’ve always had an overactive imagination that refuses to succumb to the mundane motions of life. It’s this imagination that makes the croutons in the soup resemble little rafts in stormy waters, or conjure up images of antibodies in combat gear battling the evil virus in my body when I’m sick. It makes life appear a little less dull and keeps the child in me alive.Speaking of soup and overactive imaginations, I remember the time when I tried making stone soup. That’s right, it was stone soup.With both parents away at work and my grandparents overcome by a heavy lunch-induced slumber most afternoons, I had little to do during my summer holidays. I was done giving my doll a haircut, expecting her soft blonde tufts to grow back. Watching television was out of the question, for back in those days, post the afternoon news, the TV screen only showed static until Doordarshan aired its evening programmes later in the day.The ten-year-old me was bored out of my mind, and as the saying goes, an idle mind is the devil’s workshop. As my palms itched to do something, I suddenly remember the story of the clever traveller who charmed the stingy village folk into sharing the ingredients from their larders for some soup. In the story, the weary traveller pretends to make soup by dropping a stone into a boiling pot of water. The inhospitable villagers, overcome by curiosity, eventually share potatoes, carrots and other ingredients needed to make a soup. The story ends with everyone enjoying bowls of hot, delicious soup, their inhospitable and suspicious nature replaced by warmth and cheer.I may not have had a dozen villagers to share soup with, but I did have a friend who lived on the next street and I hoped she would be gullible enough to be the subject for my experiment.I tiptoed into the kitchen, the reassuring snores emanating from my grandparents’ bedroom emboldening me further to carry on with my shenanigans. Placing a pot of water on the electric stove that had seen better days, I waited until it came to a boil before dropping a couple of unwashed stones that I’d picked up from the street.So far so good. My grandparents were oblivious to the mischief unfolding in their kitchen. I was on a roll. In went the diced and misshapen potatoes, tomatoes, some leftover onions, a couple of carrots and peas, followed by salt and pepper. The stone soup was ready.I waited for it to cool down before daring to taste a teaspoon of the horrid concoction. I nearly gagged with the first spoonful and convinced myself a couple of spoonfuls later that it wasn’t so bad.“Perhaps it’s an acquired taste,” I thought, for I had heard my mother use this term when she was unsure if she liked or disliked something.It was time to execute the second part of my plan. I carefully strained the liquid into an empty ketchup bottle and hopped on to my bicycle, pedalling away to my friend’s house before my grandparents awoke to the storm in the kitchen.Relieved that her grandparents were fast asleep and her parents away at work, I urged her to try some. She looked sceptical at first, sniffing it suspiciously. “What is it?” she asked me, making a face.I looked hurt. “Soup. It’s not poison,” I said, conveniently leaving the ‘stone’ part out of it. “Try some. I made it especially for you,” I added, sweetening the deal with a smile.My persuasive powers finally worked, and my friend glugged a couple of mouthfuls of it to prove her loyalty to me.What followed a couple of hours later was a sound dressing down from my parents, ensured by violent bouts of diarrhoea, which did not afflict me as much as it did my poor friend who refused to talk to me for two whole days.We eventually buried the hatchet, for the summer holidays stretched ahead of us — long, inviting, and with endless possibilities and working parents.

Says govt. will not cower in fear to threat ",,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday vowed to “mercilessly suppress” what he described as the attempt by the BJP and RSS to foment communal trouble in Kerala.In a strongly worded public post on his Facebook account, Mr. Vijayan said the well-rehearsed trick of the Sangh Parivar to reap political dividend by creating a schism between communities in the name of religion would not pass muster in Kerala.The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government would not cower in fear in front of any threat.Threat by Union MinisterThe Chief Minister’s comment came close on the heels of the reported “threat” by Union Minister of Textiles Smriti Irani that the Kerala government would face dire “constitutional consequences” if it pursued its “anti-faith” agenda in Sabarimala.Some quarters also construed the Chief Minister’s comment as a riposte to Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair who had blamed the government earlier in the day for “unleashing anarchy” in Kerala by mishandling the Sabarimala issue.The Chief Minister said the government had implemented the Supreme Court verdict, which said men and women had equal rights when it came to matters of faith.The government had met its constitutional obligation, he said.‘Inimical to rule of law’The forces that threatened Kerala Government with dire consequences for upholding the law were those that were inimical to the Constitution and the rule of law, he said.He blamed the RSS and BJP for the violence in Kerala.They had conspired to illegally upend the implementation of the Supreme Court order to create chaos in the State.Their ploy would fail. The Kerala police had no political colour and had prosecuted persons responsible for the rioting, irrespective of their party affiliations, the Chief Minister said."

AAP-Cong. alliance suspense continues ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-cong-alliance-suspense-continues/article25922247.ece,"
Both sides play the waiting game as outstanding issues remain unresolved
",,"Suspense over whether the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party would come together for an alliance against the BJP continued a day after high-profile resignations — of Ajay Maken as the Delhi Congress chief and H.S. Phoolka from AAP — triggered speculation about the proposed association.While sources in the AAP said there was “still a 50-50 chance” that the alliance would go through, some Congress Working Committee members said they “did not trust” AAP leaders communicating with them about it after the departure of Ashish Khetan, a close aide of Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal.“The party [Congress] is not even considering [an alliance with] the AAP; a call will be taken by the national leadership after finding Mr. Maken’s replacement,” a Congress source said.Mr. Khetan, when contacted byThe Hindu, declined to comment on the issue saying he was out of electoral politics for good.Birthday wishesOn Saturday, Mr. Kejriwal took to Twitter to extend birthday wishes to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Ms. Banerjee, according to Congress sources, had broached the topic of a like-minded alliance between the two sides for the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi.Sources in the AAP said they were certain that the Congress would demand three out of four crucial parliamentary seats in the Capital — East, South, Chandni Chowk and New Delhi — if an alliance was agreed upon.“As far as the AAP is concerned, East and Chandni Chowk have the potential to snowball into an issue in addition to the South Delhi seat. In either case, the party will risk alienating its own leaders in Punjab if any sort of association with the Congress materialises,” an AAP source said.Punjab oppositionWhile the AAP’s national council and national executive meetings held last month did not rule out the possibility of the party joining an alliance, the Punjab unit of the AAP has been opposed to the idea.Addressing reporters after the national executive meeting at Mr. Kejriwal’s residence on December 28, 2018, Punjab MP Bhagwant Mann said the party had been in Opposition in the Punjab Assembly since 2017 and had been speaking out against the policies of the Congress government in the State.“How could the ruling party and the Opposition contest Lok Sabha elections together,” he asked.Later, at a meeting of senior AAP leaders at Mr. Kejriwal’s residence on January 3, the Punjab unit leaders reiterated their opposition to the idea of aligning with the Congress, sources said.Some other recent developments have muddied the waters, particularly the attempt by the AAP to pass a resolution seeking withdrawal of the Bharat Ratna awarded to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.The AAP on the other hand is in a fix following the life sentence awarded to former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in a 1984 riots case last month, said a party leader.Declining to comment on the resignation of Mr. Phoolka, senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said he wished the senior advocate well. On Mr. Maken’s resignation, Mr. Singh said: “He had attacked the AAP more than the BJP. He may be preparing to join the BJP.”"

Reverence, relevance, restoration
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/reverence-relevance-restoration/article25917556.ece,"
A century-old residence gets a makeover, yet retains its glory at the hands of architect Husna Rahaman who deftly plays with hues and patterns. By Nandhini Sundar
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"When faced with a century-old residence or even one that is half the age, the immediate reaction is to demolish and develop the site or build a fabulous contemporary dwelling, money and space permitting. Restoring such a building to its former glory is beyond the radar, especially given the economics behind such an initiative. The state of the structure and the lifestyle the interior facilities offer, further promote this inclination.Yet, one such stately colonial residence came up, not for being rebuilt, but for restoration, keeping intact the fibre of the structure while infusing just the right level of contemporary comforts.When architect Husna Rahaman of Fulcrum Studio was given the century-old sprawling 7,000 sq. ft colonial home for restoration, the structure essentially a no-nonsense load-bearing piece of engineering that cannot be tampered with on whim, she realised that strategic alterations, if any, could happen only where absolutely necessary.The entire restoration thus occurred on a delicate balance of reverence and relevance, the regal aura retained while the modern functional quotient was brought in where relevant.Profusion of huesIn tune with the era it related to, the residence came with its accompanying hues and patterns that literally saturated the spaces, the patterned antique floor and wall tiles engulfing the ambience.Without shunning this past grandeur, Rahaman set about managing deftly the play of hues and patterns where they would enchant and refresh, without submerging the senses.“It was literally a riot of colours and this base was used as a spring board to complement the residence where it is not eliminated but used to balance”, she explains.Keeping this intent in perspective, an elegant network of wood verticals and horizontals were brought in to frame the length and breadth of the expansive living area. A new set of chandeliers were added, yet the design of these were kept deliberately colonial in keeping with the structure.Contemporary upgradeThe rich flooring was retained, along with the porcelain tile dadoing on the walls, both in the living area as well as rest of the residence. A refreshing contemporary twist was brought into the space by introducing metal motifs on the walls, the motifs reflecting the existing patterns. While the walls and ceiling continue to accommodate the wooden columns and beams, a reminder of the colonial past, the contemporary flavour wafts into the spaces through concealed lights and metal motifs.The living area reveals the presence of two groups of furniture, each connected by a large back-to-back sofa cluster.The unusual blend of materials and styles seen in the living area and carried methodically into the rest of the residence, where luxury is paired with minimalism and exquisite Indian crafts tie in seamlessly with streamlined forms, reveals a reverential contemporary upgrade of a glorious past.While the strong imperial character of the structure has been reverentially retained, the spaces have been infused with warmth to address the home it ultimately is. This has been successfully achieved through application of soft roses on the walls, neutral colours with subtle pops of colour in the rugs, strips of wallpaper and cushions in shades of pink and orange.Likewise, the spatial poetry of the house, an element lacking in modern crowded structures, has been preserved to integrate the multiple rooms, where the past meets the present, opening the spaces to surreal vistas.Infusing metalGiven the era of the residence, metal does not figure in its construction.Yet, a contemporary twist has been brought in by infusing metal craftily into the stately space, lightening the palette. The floral medallion in the living area serves as a symbolic confluence of the metallic motifs used in the rest of the residence.Metal also features as an artistic railing for the staircase, replacing the previous cement and brick staircase. The terrace further reveals a stunning dark grey metal gazebo to unwind and relax, besides serving as an entertainment zone when need arises.The first level of the building came with narrow spaces, yet the interiors were filled with abundant natural light. Rahaman decided to capture this effectively to create a sunny library. “The room came with its quota of colours and patterns like the rest of the house and the space was converted into a turquoise library with a western exposure by merely introducing rugs into the space.”The ‘sun room’ reveals rugs in intense hues of ochre and turquoise blue, soaked in geometric patterns where they define the floor, with the turquoise blue and wood verticals on the walls complementing the same. Vibrant in conception, the space greets with a burst of exuberance, the twin daybeds created between the columns further enhancing with their presence."

A century-old residence gets a makeover, yet retains its glory at the hands of architect Husna Rahaman who deftly plays with hues and patterns. By Nandhini Sundar

Restoring such a building to its former glory is beyond the radar, especially given the economics behind such an initiative. The state of the structure and the lifestyle the interior facilities offer, further promote this inclination.Yet, one such stately colonial residence came up, not for being rebuilt, but for restoration, keeping intact the fibre of the structure while infusing just the right level of contemporary comforts.When architect Husna Rahaman of Fulcrum Studio was given the century-old sprawling 7,000 sq. ft colonial home for restoration, the structure essentially a no-nonsense load-bearing piece of engineering that cannot be tampered with on whim, she realised that strategic alterations, if any, could happen only where absolutely necessary.The entire restoration thus occurred on a delicate balance of reverence and relevance, the regal aura retained while the modern functional quotient was brought in where relevant.Profusion of hues, patternsIn tune with the era it related to, the residence came with its accompanying hues and patterns that literally saturated the spaces, the patterned antique floor and wall tiles engulfing the ambience. Without shunning this past grandeur, Rahaman set about managing deftly the play of hues and patterns where they would enchant and refresh, without submerging the senses.“It was literally a riot of colours and this base was used as a spring board to complement the residence where it is not eliminated but used to balance”, she explains. Keeping this intent in perspective, an elegant network of wood verticals and horizontals were brought in to frame the length and breadth of the expansive living area. A new set of chandeliers were added, yet the design of these were kept deliberately colonial in keeping with the structure.The rich flooring was retained, along with the porcelain tile dadoing on the walls, both in the living area as well as rest of the residence.

While the walls and ceiling continue to accommodate the wooden columns and beams, a reminder of the colonial past, the contemporary flavour wafts into the spaces through concealed lights and metal motifs.Contemporary upgradeThe living area reveals the presence of two groups of furniture, each connected by a large back-to-back sofa cluster. The unusual blend of materials and styles seen in the living area and carried methodically into the rest of the residence, where luxury is paired with minimalism and exquisite Indian crafts tie in seamlessly with streamlined forms, reveals a reverential contemporary upgrade of a glorious past.While the strong imperial character of the structure has been reverentially retained, the spaces have been infused with warmth to address the home it ultimately is. This has been successfully achieved through application of soft roses on the walls, neutral colours with subtle pops of colour in the rugs, strips of wallpaper and cushions in shades of pink and orange.Likewise, the spatial poetry of the house, an element lacking in modern crowded structures, has been preserved to integrate the multiple rooms, where the past meets the present, opening the spaces to surreal vistas.Infusing metalGiven the era of the residence, metal does not figure in its construction. Yet, a contemporary twist has been brought in by infusing metal craftily into the stately space, lightening the palette. The floral medallion in the living area serves as a symbolic confluence of the metallic motifs used in the rest of the residence. Metal also features as an artistic railing for the staircase, replacing the previous cement and brick staircase. The terrace further reveals a stunning dark grey metal gazebo to unwind and relax, besides serving as an entertainment zone when need arises.Sun roomThe first level of the building came with narrow spaces, yet the interiors were filled with abundant natural light. Rahaman decided to capture this effectively to create a sunny library. “The room came with its quota of colours and patterns like the rest of the house and the space was converted into a turquoise library with a western exposure by merely introducing rugs into the space.”The ‘sun room’ reveals rugs in intense hues of ochre and turquoise blue, soaked in geometric patterns where they define the floor, with the turquoise blue and wood verticals on the walls complementing the same.

Street where many shops were destroyed in the afternoon when a march taken out by the Sabarimala Karma Samiti as part of the hartal turned violent. Opening the protest, CPI(M) district secretary P. Mohanan said that none of the devotees present at the hill shrine were reported to have objected to the entry of the women. However, the RSS-BJP activists took this as an opportunity to damage shops and loot articles from there.

Ruling party has betrayed the people of India, says Sena
",,"In an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Shiv Sena on Thursday said it wondered when the Ram temple could be constructed if not during the tenure of the current BJP-led majority government.It said, if the Ram temple cannot be built before the 2019 polls, it will be akin to betraying people of the country, and the BJP and the RSS would have to apologise for it.The Sena, an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra, criticised Mr. Modi for his comment in a recent interview, broadcast by several TV channels, that any government action on the temple construction can happen only after the judicial process is over.“He (Mr. Modi) came to power in the name of Ram, however, according to him, law is not bigger than Lord Ram. The question now is if the temple cannot be constructed in a majority government, when will it ever be,” the Sena asked in an editorial in party mouthpieceSaamana.The Modi government got a magnificent statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel constructed in Gujarat, but the Prime Minister did not show the courage of ‘sardar’ over the Ram temple issue, it said.The agitation for the Ram temple began in 1991-92 and hundreds of ‘kar sevaks’ lost their lives, it noted. “While hundreds of Hindu kar sevaks died, the subsequent (Mumbai) bomb blasts led to the killing of hundreds from both sides (Hindu and Muslim communities). If the Supreme Court had to take the decision, why this massacre and bloodshed?” it asked.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party further sought to know whether the BJP and the RSS were ready to take the responsibility for those killings and bloodshed.“The way the Congress had to apologise for the massacre of Sikhs (after the anti-Sikh riots in 1984), we have to understand the sentiments of those who demand an apology (from the BJP) for the massacre of Hindus,” it said.the Marathi daily also attacked Mr. Modi for defending demonetisation in the interview and said “Those who lost their lives in bank queues and lost their jobs, were they not citizens?”Mr. Modi came to power in the name of Ram, but according to him law is not bigger than the LordSaamanaShiv Sena party mouthpiece"

‘Earlier, the party had fooled people in the name ofGaribi Hataoand now it is deceiving farmers’
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday hit out at the Congress, accusing it of betraying farmers on the issue of loan waiver, besides alleging the party was not only shielding but also promoting those involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.“Earlier the Congress had fooled people in the name ofGaribi Hataoand now it was deceiving the farming community in the name of waiving loans. They have failed to keep their promises,” said Mr. Modi, addressing a BJP-Shiromani Akali Dal rally at Gurdaspur in Punjab.“In Karnataka, loans of farmers are not being waived. In Punjab, the truth about loan waiver is that in one and a half years only Rs. 3,400 crore was waived. This is as per the State government’s own documents. They have failed to keep their promise. How many years will they take to waive loans. Is it a five-year plan for them,” said Mr. Modi.“The Congress was involved in shielding and rewarding those involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots,” he claimed.Historic decisionThe NDA government took a historic decision to build a ‘corridor’ from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur to the Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, he said. Akali Dal president and former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal said the long-pending issues of the Sikh community had been resolved by the Modi-led NDA government.“The NDA government established a SIT to investigate the 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases and even reopened them. This step had already resulted in conviction of two persons within one year,” he said.Mr. Badal hit out at Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, accusing him of going back on his promise of complete loan waiver."

Five films vastly different in pace and temperament – yet bound by the theme of family and sororities – make it to our best of international films list
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Cinema can breed a peculiar rapaciousness—the more you feed on images, the more voracious your appetite becomes. In a year where I could feast on a lot more than usual, I still couldn’t savour a bunch — Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’sNever Look Away, Benedikt Erlingsson’sWoman At War, Marcelo Martinessi’sThe Heiresses, Tamara Jenkins’Private Life,to name just a few.Of the lot that were seen, many have registered strongly in the mind’s eye. The many separations than the few shared moments between Zula and Viktor inCold War, Pawel Pawlikowski’s haunting dissection of the human repercussions of politics, of individual desires getting smothered in the grim march of time and history. Sergei Loznitsa’s political sledgehammerDonbassthat brings alive a depressing, dystopian vision of the site of war between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government and could well boast of the most brilliant climax at the movies this year. OrBurning, Lee Chang-Dong’s tale of obsessive love that casts a complex glance at contemporary Korean society, youth and the issues of anxieties and rage.From the political pugnacity of Spike Lee’sBlacKkklansmanto the hypnotic perversity of Lars Von Trier’sThe House That Jack Built; fromLeave No Trace, Debra Granik’s affecting take on choices and relationships nurtured on the fringes of societal norms to Coen Bros’The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, the darkly funny anthology Western on the unforeseeable theme of death; from the avant garde Jean-Luc Godard collageThe Image Bookto “I wanted to get another look at you” moment of Bradley Cooper’sA Star Is Bornall the way to the astonishing success of the low budget, loveable zombie laugh riot—Shinichiro Ueda’sOne Cut Of The Dead—a lot happened in cinema across the globe.These five films, however, were singular, and united, in laying bare the human condition and examining individuals and relationships with immense profundity, astuteness and wisdom. They were also, coincidentally, about families and sororities.Alfonso Cuaron’sRomaIt’s common to fall in love with a film but rare to get swept over by one.Romahas been that exception. Having viewed it thrice in as many months, on the big screen, as Alfonso Cuaron meant it to be seen, my impressions remain scattered, incoherent, grappling to find the right words.Cuaron’s intensely personal love letter to his nanny, that he has said to have made with memory as a tool, is indeed like a reverie on screen. It’s for each of us to read our own meaning—be it the aircraft’s reflection in the splashing water, the high jumps and the ginormous amount of poo produced by the family dog Borrus or the funny attempt to park a huge car in a narrow veranda.There’s more to the most beloved film of the year. IfRomawere a piece of music then there is a particularly magnificent movement in Cuaron’s composition. Cleo is humming a song that goes, ‘But I was born poor and you will never love me’, while washing clothes on the terrace. The youngest child of the house pretends being dead after a shootout game. She plays along, comes to lie next to him, refusing to get up when he calls out for her. “I like being dead,” she says as the camera moves away from them to present a larger view of several maids, like her, washing clothes on the adjacent terraces of the neighbouring upper class homes, with dogs jumping and barking around them, quite like Borrus does, around Cleo. Without getting tetchy, Cuaron takes down the behemoth of class divides, in one lyrical stroke. It all leads on to a dissonant scene much later where Cleo’s lover Fermin disgustingly dismisses her as “fucking servant”.Cuaron keeps rocking the bourgeoisie boat ever so gently. Here dogs and maids belong to the same order in the hierarchy; in fact the dead dogs of the houses are perhaps better remembered with their stuffed heads bizarrely displayed as trophies on walls.The film is seamless in knitting together personal upheavals and political, social and cultural agitations into a nuanced whole with the personal and political, gender and class atrocities coming together direly in the persona of Fermin.Roma isa sweeping, all-embracing tale about the intensely tragic turbulences that creep up in life, leave you shaken but also stronger and more resilient.There are films that serenade you for a while,Romais a keeper.Barry Jenkins’If Beale Street Could TalkThe rush and passion of young love, the rhythm, innocence and intense beauty of a couple’s first brush with intimacy, the delicate dance of the bodies... Barry Jenkins creates glorious romance on screen in a manner reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai. However, the lyrical moments of togetherness, the languid images are grounded in the unfair, ugly reality of racism and concomitant inequities. The tale of a young girl fighting to get her wrongfully confined lover out of jail before the birth of their first childBeale Streetis about separation and desperation and yet a perseverance and persistence of devotion. Families can bloom from across the walls of the prison, people can be together in separation, love can heal. Only Jenkins could have looked at the fractious issue of race relations in this characteristic gentle, genteel and abundantly graceful way. Underlined with the hope that, “our children can be free”.Hirokazu Kore-eda’sShopliftersAre families a biological inheritance or can we cobble them together as we move along in life? It’s a complex thought that lies at the core of a seemingly simpleShoplifters. A family of thieves takes a little girl, who has been hurt and abused in her home, under its wings. Will this love and affection that comes from her new parents and siblings last a lifetime or remain just a short tryst? Often called the true inheritor of the legacy of Yasujirō Ozu, Kore-eda has been candid about putting familial ties persistently under the scanner. In his own quiet, gentle and humane yet devastating way he weighs in on an alternative, surrogate family against the traditional construct but refuses to offer any convenient answers.Nuri Bilge Ceylan’sThe Wild Pear TreeTextured and rivetingly shot in long takes, resting heavy on several probing conversations and resounding metaphors (like the persistent digging of a well), Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s ode to fathers and sons is the unheralded masterpiece of 2018. A young man returns home from college only to find it hard to fit back in to the family that has been battling with the debts of his father. He has his own worries about the future—being a writer and a teacher but without a job for the moment. Ceylan questions the family but also sees the futility of entirely negating it. The young protagonist’s search for direction also becomes a reflection of the larger unrest in Turkey. A densely layered film,The Wild Pear Treepacks a lot in its quiet images.Yorgos Lanthimos’The FavouriteThree scorching women at its core and men turned perfunctory, the delectable tale of a strange sorority—Queen Anne, her confidant and advisor Duchess of Marlborough Sarah Churchill, and Sarah’s cousin Abigail Hill—is the most refreshingly wicked and irreverent film of the year.The ladies are brutally immoral, ambitious, manipulative and transgressive but not once does the filmmaker, or the audience, turn judgmental. The Anne, Sarah and Abigail triangle is less about love and affection, more about deceit and betrayals because relationships here are not sacred, merely a tool used for political one-upmanship. Lanthimos’ women are not just survivors but have a sharp killer instinct and believe firmly in the adage—self above everyone else.Romais seamless in knitting together personal upheavals and political, social and cultural agitations into a nuanced whole"

I wasn’t in Shardashram but he looked after me so well.“Since he never said “well done” to any of us, we had to take cues from his gestures to guess that he was happy with someone’s performance. For instance, if he took someone to havechaatopposite Mafatlal or took some of us home to Wadala for dinner, we would know he was happy with our performance.“He treated everyone the same way.

He would always say “cricket is a never-ending story, whether you get runs or not.”Balwinder Sandhu, a 1983 World Cup-team member and Mumbai Ranji coach, said, “I missed my father’s funeral in 1985, I do not know how I will react at my cricketing father’s funeral.“He saw talent in young players, which is a rare quality, gave us ample opportunities to blossom and most importantly, did not hold on to his trainees. Like young ones of birds fly away from the nest at some point, he allowed talented youngsters groomed by him to develop under other coaches.”“I consulted Hemu Dalvi even when I was being coached by him, but Achrekar Sir did not stop me. A hard-working coach, he developed players without expecting anything from them, which is a rare quality in a human being. I was off-spinner and he saw fast bowling quality in me and gave me opportunities in his own unique style. For example, in a 50-over match, I was allowed to bowl 20 or more overs. The captain was under instruction from Sir that the young sardar can bowl as long as he does not gets tired, the only condition that I bowl fast, not spin.“Later on when I became coach (Mumbai and Baroda Ranji Trophy sides), I kept meeting him at every opportunity. He taught me to treat talented youngsters differently. My father, whose support proved vital in early years, took me to Achrekar Sir, who charged ₹50 in those days. We could not afford even that money, never was my father or me asked about pending fees. I do not know how he managed finance to run his coaching career, the lesson remains with me that a youngster with special talent should not be suffering due to money. I try to follow Achrekar Sir’s example. He was suffering for some time, I feel for someone who made the career of so many cricketers, he should not have suffered, but God has his reasons.”(Inputs from G.

‘The only way forward is to enact legislation’ ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Wednesday said “the Hindu society cannot wait till eternity” for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on Tuesday that he would not bring legislation for the temple before the legal process got over.VHP international working president Alok Kumar said here that “considering the overall situation, the VHP continues to be of the firm view that the Hindu society cannot be expected to wait till eternity for a court decision.” “The only appropriate way forward is to enact legislation clearing the way for the construction of a grand Ram temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi now,” he added.He clarified that the VHP did not see attempts to introduce a private member Bill for the construction of a temple in Ayodhya, stating that a “government-sponsored Bill” was what the organisation wanted.“Further steps will be decided by Hindu seers at the Dharam Sansad to be held during the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj,” he added.Mr. Kumar said the VHP had by now contacted 350 members of Parliament, but was waiting for on appointments with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi to try and persuade them to support a Bill aiding the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya.Mr. Modi’s comments had come amid heightened demands by Hindutva organisations, including the RSS, for an ordinance for early construction of the temple in Ayodhya.The government also faced fire from its ally, Shiv Sena, with party MP Sanjay Raut putting out a strong statement. “We don’t need the Prime Minister to tell us that the matter is in court. If that’s what we wanted what was the need for the movement? Karsewaks martyred, bomb blasts in Mumbai, riots; it was genocide in the Ram temple’s name, who is responsible? You [the BJP] formed the government on this issue, don’t forget that,” he said."

Street where many shops were destroyed in the afternoon when a march taken out by the Sabarimala Karma Samiti as part of the hartal turned violent. Opening the protest, CPI(M) district secretary P. Mohanan said that none of the devotees present at the hill shrine were reported to have objected to the entry of the women. However, the RSS-BJP activists took this as an opportunity to damage shops and loot articles from there. The CPI(M) leader said that the authorities should look into the complaint that the police had failed to protect the shops.Mr. Mohanan also said that many libraries and CPI(M) offices too were targeted by the miscreants. He alleged that the Sangh Parivar activists were trying to topple the government by launching a second liberation struggle. Mr. Mohanan claimed that the Opposition United Democratic Front was helping this attempt.Meanwhile, CPI district secretary T.V.

Diary of the year to come ",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/diary-of-the-year-to-come/article25874955.ece,"
A cluster of anniversaries exhorts all Indians to be true to their conscience in 2019 ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"As one year dips and another dawns, a calendar of anniversaries is un-scrolled. In India, this happens with the hectic intensity of a traffic jam. The year that begins today is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi and the death of Mirza Ghalib.Hundred years agoWhat is it notably the 100th anniversary of? Curiously, not of historic persons as much as of three historic happenings. First, a much-hailed enactment, the Government of India Act of 1919, which increased the participation of Indians in the Government of India. Second, a much-hated law, Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, known notoriously as the Rowlatt Act or Black Act, which entrenched war-time restrictions on civil liberties — indefinite preventive detention or judicial review of those suspected of terrorism, trial without juries, jailings without trials. Third, a national trauma that arose from the vortex of protests against the Rowlatt Act — the massacre by army bullets of 379 according to the Raj, and some thousand men, women and children according to the Indian National Congress, at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar. Terrorism is wrong, Gandhi and other leaders said, violence evil. But are the civil liberties of a whole people to be frozen? Rabindranath Tagore returned his knighthood a hundred years ago, this year. But scores of other ‘Sirs’ and ‘Rai Bahadurs’ did not.So this is the centenary of something that brought enchained India some hope, as well as huge despair and, hauntingly, mass death. And it is also the centenary of heroic courage, of sacrifice.And 50th? This is the 50th anniversary of the Gujarat riots of September-October 1969, that involved massacre, arson and looting said to constitute “the most deadly Hindu-Muslim violence since the 1947 partition of India”. Out of the 512 deaths reported in police complaints, 430 were Muslims. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, then nearly 80, visited India that year. A guest of the state and of the people of India, he fasted for three days for communal peace, went to Ahmedabad to see things for himself. In his acceptance speech while receiving the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding, he repeated to the audience what a Muslim girl in Ahmedabad had told him: “Muslims were being asked by Hindu communalists to leave the country or live like untouchables.” And in an address to a joint session of Parliament, he was brutal in his assessment: “You are forgetting Gandhi the way you forgot the Buddha.” This is the 50th anniversary of that chastisement.Two sides of 1984Thirty-five is not a particularly memorable number but when an event is of some moment, its 35th anniversary carries something of that moment’s star-dust. This year marks the 35th anniversary of one such.The year was 1984, the month April. Squadron Leader Rakesh Sharma of the Indian Air Force was going round the earth aboard the Salyut 7 Orbital Station (picture). He was the first Indian to be in outer space. The ISRO-Intercosmos Indo-Soviet space programme had put six men into space, five from the U.S.S.R. and our own Rakesh, then all of 35 years old. Rakesh received a satellite call from India’s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. She asked Rakesh, “Upar se apko Bharat kaisa dikhta hai? (How does India seem to you from up there?)” Footage shows the hero-in-motion slightly startled by the question but collecting himself in a moment to respond reflectively: “Sare jahan se achha(Better than all the world).” That immortal half-line from Allama Iqbal’s song reverberated through the air-waves into millions of homes watching the first-ever Indian orbiting the planet we live in. And as the nation heard and saw him, a sense of India’s greatness stirred within it. This year is the 35th anniversary of that dizzy moment.Not a star twinkles over India as an envious eclipse veils it. We celebrate India only to be checked by our misfortunes.Orbiting with stars Rakesh Sharma did not know that India had a date with another ‘star’ within two months that very year — Operation Blue Star, leading to Indira Gandhi’s assassination and the killing of anything between 8,000 and 17,000 Sikh Indians at the hands of fellow Indians. Large numbers of Indians reached out to the victims, taking them to hospitals, sheltering them. And, most important of all, documenting their trauma to fight for them another day. But much larger numbers did no such thing. They stayed put, watching with glazed eyes.This year is the 35th anniversary of that tragic sequence as well. And so, as we enter another new year, a question to pose to ourselves is: Will India in 2019 looksare jahan se achha? Or will it be a blend of pleasure and pain, glory and shame? No one can tell. But if one may have anniversary wishes, this citizen-nobody does.On this anniversary of hopes and of griefs, of courage and of cowering, we must look at the opportunities that knock at our country’s great and gaunt gate. We must make the national elections due in a few months a great example of democratic self-assertion, making the weak self-assert. In 2019 the people of India must vote, even more emphatically than ever before, without succumbing to manipulation and to fear.Seventy years ago this year, speaking in the Constituent Assembly, B.R. Ambedkar said: “…it is quite possible in a country like India – where democracy from its long disuse must be regarded as something quite new – there is danger of democracy giving place to dictatorship. It is quite possible for this new born democracy to retain its form but give place to dictatorship in fact. If there is a landslide, the danger of the second possibility becoming actuality is much greater.”Why should we be so alert to the danger that he pointed out? Not just because an opportunity has come for effecting a change of government but because far-reaching, liberating changes are needed in the country.Meaning of liberationWhat are these liberating changes? The first is the liberation of our public life from fear. Under Swaraj no less than under the Raj, fear can paralyse dissent, immobilise free speech, free association. It is not just an insecure state but insecure techno-commercial monopolies as well that are uncomfortable with freedom. Threats to Right to Information (RTI) activists and whistle-blowers and attacks on them, trolling of dissenters on social media and even murder, constitute democratic India’s single greatest failure, shame. In the eighth decade of its independence, India ought to be afraid of nothing, save its conscience.The second is the liberation of our politics from the stranglehold of money. Which, in effect, means saving our national resources from the darkness of deceit and exploitation. Money minted by illegal mining, unauthorised clandestine monopolies and brazen preferment has a vice-like grip over our polity, particularly over our electoral politics. Money frustrates democracy, negates it. Ruling parties everywhere say, “Our hands are clean!” The Opposition says, “Show us your pockets.” And when they change places, the charge changes direction.The third — and most difficult — is the liberation of ethics from the hegemony of lifeless conformism. For far too long, centuries in fact, have custom, and callousness overwhelmed conscience in India. Routine and rote rule over humane instincts, making women, tribals, the Scheduled Castes, children, prisoners, the mentally challenged and physically unable exposed to danger. The same dullened sensitivity has rendered our wetlands, rivers, coasts and commons vulnerable to misuse, misappropriation. Whoever be the Asoka or the anti-Asoka on Magadha’s throne, India’s Bodhi-tree needs an Enlightened One to sit by its root-bed and speak to it now, more than ever before, to be able to say to it to become not just ‘sare jahan se achha’, better than all the world, but ‘apne dil se sachcha’, to its own self, true.Gopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator, diplomat and governor"

Koregaon Bhima anniversary passes off peacefully under massive security shield ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/koregaon-bhima-anniversary-security-stepped-up-as-people-pay-tributes-at-war-memorial/article25879015.ece,"
The ‘jay stambh’ was erected by the British as a memorial for soldiers killed in the Koregaon Bhima battle on January 1, 1818.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The 201st anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon battle passed off without incident as lakhs of Ambedkarites from across the State and country congregated near the Ranstambh (victory pillar) on Tuesday under heavy security cover.Even then, the 7,000-odd security personnel struggled to cope with an estimated footfall of seven lakh persons including activists of Dalit outfits, politicos, pilgrims, soldiers, and members of Ambedkarite groups.District administration officials estimated eight to ten lakh footfalls this year – perhaps the largest turnout of visitors since the Bhima-Koregaon Ranstambh Seva Sangh (BKRSS), which organizes the ceremony, was formed in 2005 to keep alive the memory of this episode [Dalit bravery in the Bhima-Koregaon battle] in Indian history.Police contingents and reserve forces, deployed across a nine-km stretch from the obelisk, ensured that the crowds moved in an orderly direction towards the obelisk.Ignoring the raw nip in the air, a sea of blue flags, chanting ‘Jai Bhim’ slogans descended upon the Bhima-Koregaon village, 30 km from Pune city.Crowds had been steadily milling in Bhima-Koregaon since Monday evening itself amid glittering fireworks to pay floral tributes to the bravery of the Mahar soldiers who fought against the Peshwa forces in the 1818 battle.While the outcome of the Koregaon-Bhima battle was inconclusive, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s visit to the spot on January 1, 1927, revitalized its memory for the Dalit community, making it a rallying point and an assertion of pride.Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh (BBM) chief Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, was among the first Dalit leaders to lay a wreath near the obelisk today morning.Speaking to reporters, Mr. Ambedkar said that the ‘Elgaar Parishad’ of December 31 last year had been an attempt to bridge the rift between various communities.“Instead, the investigation conducted by the Pune City police turned the objective of the Elgaar conclave upside down. The State government targeted the men and women like retired judges B.G. Kolse-Patil, P.B. Sawant and Harshali Potdar, who were behind organizing the conference, weaving an absurd narrative of ‘urban naxalism’,” said Mr. Ambedkar, speaking to reporters.The BBM chief remarked that instead of promoting a feeling amity between communities, the riots and the subsequent investigations have only widened the rift between the Maratha and the OBC community.Other Dalit leaders, like Republican Party of India (RPI) chief and Union Minister Ramdas Athawale and Bhim Army leader Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ were expected to visit the obelisk later in the day.Internet services were suspended to prevent the spread of inflammatory messages, while a massive security detail, including drones and CCTV cameras, were in place near the tombs of the Maratha King Sambhaji and that of Govind Ganpat Mahar in Vadhu Budruk village (3.5 km from Bhima-Koregaon) – the major flashpoints leading to the Bhima-Koregaon violence last year.“This time, we have adopted a four-pronged approach that includes crowd management, traffic flow management, maintenance of law and order situation and keeping an anti-sabotage vigil to ensure the event passes off smoothly,” said Special Inspector General of Police, Vishwas Nangare- Patil.An air of restraint marked the occasion as politicos and outfits kept addresses and speechifying to a minimum.Pune District Collector Nawal Kishore Ram had said that while the administration would not prevent leaders from making speeches, the police would clamp down on provocative or potentially inflammatory addresses.Earlier, videos with messages of amity and communal harmony had been put out by both Maratha and OBC panchayat samiti members in the run-up to the event.But despite the outward show of harmony, bitterness and unease continues to linger among the riot afflicted.“There is has been no justice for us a year on after the riots…there has been no action against the mob that vandalized by home and burnt my shop,” said Mangal Kamble, one of the victims.Likewise, Jaideep Sakat, who took refuge in his neighbour’s house while his home was torched, accused the police of apathy and dragging their feet over the probe.Last week, more than 1,200 habitual offenders were taken into preventive detention by the Pune Rural Police while prohibitory orders were issued to Hindutva leaders Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide, named as chief instigators of the clashes."

Diary of the year to come

A cluster of anniversaries exhorts all Indians to be true to their conscience in 2019
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"As one year dips and another dawns, a calendar of anniversaries is un-scrolled. In India, this happens with the hectic intensity of a traffic jam. The year that begins today is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi and the death of Mirza Ghalib.Hundred years agoWhat is it notably the 100th anniversary of? Curiously, not of historic persons as much as of three historic happenings. First, a much-hailed enactment, the Government of India Act of 1919, which increased the participation of Indians in the Government of India. Second, a much-hated law, Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, known notoriously as the Rowlatt Act or Black Act, which entrenched war-time restrictions on civil liberties — indefinite preventive detention or judicial review of those suspected of terrorism, trial without juries, jailings without trials. Third, a national trauma that arose from the vortex of protests against the Rowlatt Act — the massacre by army bullets of 379 according to the Raj, and some thousand men, women and children according to the Indian National Congress, at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar. Terrorism is wrong, Gandhi and other leaders said, violence evil. But are the civil liberties of a whole people to be frozen? Rabindranath Tagore returned his knighthood a hundred years ago, this year. But scores of other ‘Sirs’ and ‘Rai Bahadurs’ did not.So this is the centenary of something that brought enchained India some hope, as well as huge despair and, hauntingly, mass death. And it is also the centenary of heroic courage, of sacrifice.And 50th? This is the 50th anniversary of the Gujarat riots of September-October 1969, that involved massacre, arson and looting said to constitute “the most deadly Hindu-Muslim violence since the 1947 partition of India”. Out of the 512 deaths reported in police complaints, 430 were Muslims. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, then nearly 80, visited India that year. A guest of the state and of the people of India, he fasted for three days for communal peace, went to Ahmedabad to see things for himself. In his acceptance speech while receiving the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding, he repeated to the audience what a Muslim girl in Ahmedabad had told him: “Muslims were being asked by Hindu communalists to leave the country or live like untouchables.” And in an address to a joint session of Parliament, he was brutal in his assessment: “You are forgetting Gandhi the way you forgot the Buddha.” This is the 50th anniversary of that chastisement.Two sides of 1984Thirty-five is not a particularly memorable number but when an event is of some moment, its 35th anniversary carries something of that moment’s star-dust. This year marks the 35th anniversary of one such.The year was 1984, the month April. Squadron Leader Rakesh Sharma of the Indian Air Force was going round the earth aboard the Salyut 7 Orbital Station (picture). He was the first Indian to be in outer space. The ISRO-Intercosmos Indo-Soviet space programme had put six men into space, five from the U.S.S.R. and our own Rakesh, then all of 35 years old. Rakesh received a satellite call from India’s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. She asked Rakesh, “Upar se apko Bharat kaisa dikhta hai? (How does India seem to you from up there?)” Footage shows the hero-in-motion slightly startled by the question but collecting himself in a moment to respond reflectively: “Sare jahan se achha(Better than all the world).” That immortal half-line from Allama Iqbal’s song reverberated through the air-waves into millions of homes watching the first-ever Indian orbiting the planet we live in. And as the nation heard and saw him, a sense of India’s greatness stirred within it. This year is the 35th anniversary of that dizzy moment.Not a star twinkles over India as an envious eclipse veils it. We celebrate India only to be checked by our misfortunes.Orbiting with stars Rakesh Sharma did not know that India had a date with another ‘star’ within two months that very year — Operation Blue Star, leading to Indira Gandhi’s assassination and the killing of anything between 8,000 and 17,000 Sikh Indians at the hands of fellow Indians. Large numbers of Indians reached out to the victims, taking them to hospitals, sheltering them. And, most important of all, documenting their trauma to fight for them another day. But much larger numbers did no such thing. They stayed put, watching with glazed eyes.This year is the 35th anniversary of that tragic sequence as well. And so, as we enter another new year, a question to pose to ourselves is: Will India in 2019 looksare jahan se achha? Or will it be a blend of pleasure and pain, glory and shame? No one can tell. But if one may have anniversary wishes, this citizen-nobody does.On this anniversary of hopes and of griefs, of courage and of cowering, we must look at the opportunities that knock at our country’s great and gaunt gate. We must make the national elections due in a few months a great example of democratic self-assertion, making the weak self-assert. In 2019 the people of India must vote, even more emphatically than ever before, without succumbing to manipulation and to fear.Seventy years ago this year, speaking in the Constituent Assembly, B.R. Ambedkar said: “…it is quite possible in a country like India – where democracy from its long disuse must be regarded as something quite new – there is danger of democracy giving place to dictatorship. It is quite possible for this new born democracy to retain its form but give place to dictatorship in fact. If there is a landslide, the danger of the second possibility becoming actuality is much greater.”Why should we be so alert to the danger that he pointed out? Not just because an opportunity has come for effecting a change of government but because far-reaching, liberating changes are needed in the country.Meaning of liberationWhat are these liberating changes? The first is the liberation of our public life from fear. Under Swaraj no less than under the Raj, fear can paralyse dissent, immobilise free speech, free association. It is not just an insecure state but insecure techno-commercial monopolies as well that are uncomfortable with freedom. Threats to Right to Information (RTI) activists and whistle-blowers and attacks on them, trolling of dissenters on social media and even murder, constitute democratic India’s single greatest failure, shame. In the eighth decade of its independence, India ought to be afraid of nothing, save its conscience.The second is the liberation of our politics from the stranglehold of money. Which, in effect, means saving our national resources from the darkness of deceit and exploitation. Money minted by illegal mining, unauthorised clandestine monopolies and brazen preferment has a vice-like grip over our polity, particularly over our electoral politics. Money frustrates democracy, negates it. Ruling parties everywhere say, “Our hands are clean!” The Opposition says, “Show us your pockets.” And when they change places, the charge changes direction.The third — and most difficult — is the liberation of ethics from the hegemony of lifeless conformism. For far too long, centuries in fact, have custom, and callousness overwhelmed conscience in India. Routine and rote rule over humane instincts, making women, tribals, the Scheduled Castes, children, prisoners, the mentally challenged and physically unable exposed to danger. The same dullened sensitivity has rendered our wetlands, rivers, coasts and commons vulnerable to misuse, misappropriation. Whoever be the Asoka or the anti-Asoka on Magadha’s throne, India’s Bodhi-tree needs an Enlightened One to sit by its root-bed and speak to it now, more than ever before, to be able to say to it to become not just ‘sare jahan se achha’, better than all the world, but ‘apne dil se sachcha’, to its own self, true.Gopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator, diplomat and governor"

We will not stop him. But one must understand that considering last year’se incident, the top priority of the police authorities is to maintain law and order.

Mr. Azad was in Mumbai three day back to address a rally, but was kept detained for two days by police. He was denied permission to hold a rally, and barred from visiting Chaityabhoomi in Dadar.“We all know what happened there after the rally.

Kader Khan: a man of many parts
",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kader-khan-a-man-of-many-parts/article25882752.ece,"
Five best lines written by Kader Khan and five memorable characters he played on screen
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Bachchan. Jeetendra. Govinda. Action. Emotion. Comedy. Kader Khan wrote the entire spectrum of filmi emotions in an extremely durable writing career of about thirty years.Amar Akbar Anthony: “Aise toh aadmi life mein doich time bhaagta hai, Olympic ka race ho ya police ka case ho!” drawled Anthony-bhaiin typical Mumbaitaporilingo. Manmohan Desai’s favourite dialogue-writer, Khan endeared himself to the director by using everyday language, coming up with punchlines and doing so at a speed that matched the maker’s scorching pace.Muqaddar Ka Sikandar: “Zinda hai who log jo maut se takrate hain. Murdo se badtar hai woh log jo maut se ghabrate hain… Taqdeer tere kadmon mein hogi aur tu muqaddar ka badshah hoga…” With these lines (and more), Kader Khan made it big with Prakash Mehra as well, writing dialogues that would transport Amitabh Bachchan from a superstar to a megastar.Himmatwala: “Tumhari loot maar ko khatam karke, tumhari zabardasti ki hukumat ko ujaadne wala, himmatwala”, screamed the hero. A misunderstanding with Bachchan saw him move to the South for a slew of films (many starring Jeetendra). Some of his scripts were criticised for their crass humour but Khan clearly knew the audience’s pulse as all of them were wildly popular with the masses.Agneepath: “Yeh chhe foot ka body ludkane ke liye chaar inch ka goli kam pad gaya, maloom?” Probably his best script, Khan revealed in an interview that he had recorded all the dialogues on a tape and gave it to Bachchan to help him understand the voice modulation and delivery. The lines became cult classics and Bachchan’s performance won a National Award for acting.Coolie No. 1: “Duniya mera ghar hai, bus stand mera adda hai, jab mann kare aa jaana, Raju mera naam hai aur pyar se log mujhe bulaate hain Coolie number one”. Khan handled the Bachchan-Govinda transition with aplomb. By now, his original hero was a pale shadow of himself but he was still writing whistle-inducing dialogues for the Hero No. 1.As an actorComedy. Villainy. Conscience-keeping. Probably due to Khan’s super-prolific output, his landmark roles tend to get lost and he doesn’t get enough credit for the wide range of roles – many of them he himself wrote the lines for!Inquilaab: Kader Khan’s stellar career as a menacing, conniving villain can be well-represented by this character – an unscrupulous political leader who manipulates Amitabh Bachchan’s character. His measured movements and deliberate dialogue delivery style were an asset for this ‘mastermind’ kind of roles.Baap Numbri Beta Dus Numbri: Kader Khan stopped being a villain quite emotionally when he saw his sons getting ridiculed and even beaten up for his negative roles. He started doing comic roles in the mid-1980s and soon formed a partnership with Shakti Kapoor (who often called Kader Khan as his guru). This film is one of their more hilarious outings, where the comic duo called the shots despite having a A-list lead pair!Hum: In a double role, Kader Khan played an Army General and a nautanki actor. The former was a ‘kadak’ soldier and had quite a few sharp lines about patriotism while the latter was bit of a flake with silly lines by the dozen. In the film, the latter was called on to replace the former and Khan uncorked mayhem!Angaar: An under-discussed but complex role, where he played Jahangir Khan, a benevolent don ruling over Mumbai. His ego was intertwined with his benevolence, his benevolence at odds with his love for his sons and the love for his sons got overshadowed by his ego. It was neither a villainous nor a heroic character and Khan brought interesting dimensions to it.Aankhen: A laugh riot had twin Kader Khans as the fathers of Govinda, Chunky Pandey and Govinda. Govinda and David Dhawan formed a dynamite box-office combination in the 1990s and Kader Khan’s short roles in many of their films were frothy icings on the cakes. The double role in Aankhen was among his best comic performances.The writer has authored five books, four of which are on Hindi cinema"

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"As the year comes to an end,The Hindutakes a look at some of the decisions of the Delhi High Court that transcended State boundaries in its implications, opened new avenues for women in the forces, and promoted public interest.The year will go down in history as the year the Delhi High Court warned perpetrators of mass crimes that they will not escape prosecution and punishment even if they enjoyed “political patronage”.Mirchpur riotsEight years after a caste violence incident rocked Mirchpur village in the neighbouring State of Haryana, the Delhi High Court in August 2018 convicted four persons of murder, and 28 others from the Jat community of rioting and other crimes.On April 21, 2010, an irate mob of people from the Jat community — the dominant community in Mirchpur — burned down 18 houses belonging to the Valmikis, a Dalit community. A 60-year-old Dalit and his differently abled daughter were burnt alive during the riot.The trigger for the riot was a seemingly trivial incident that took place on the evening of April 19, 2010, when a dog, which belonged to a Valmiki resident, barked at a group of Jat youth.At least 254 Valmiki families fled Mirchpur in the aftermath of the riot and many sought shelter in a farmhouse of one Ved Pal Tanwar. Over eight years later, many of those who fled are yet to return to Mirchpur.In December 2010, the Supreme Court ordered shifting of the case from Haryana to Delhi following apprehensions whether a fair trial would be conducted in the State. The Delhi HC overturned the acquittal of 20 persons who were earlier acquitted by the trial court.The Delhi HC noted that even seven decades after Independence, atrocities on communities belonging to the Scheduled Caste have shown no signs of abating.“The atmosphere of fear created by the members of the dominant Jat community was evidently so severe that the confidence of the members of the Valmiki community about their safety and security in Mirchpur is yet to be restored,” the HC noted.Hashimpura massacreOver 31 years after 38 Muslims from Hashimpura were rounded up and shot by the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), the Delhi High Court in October 2018 sent 16 former PAC jawans to life imprisonment for murder.“This was a case of targeted killing... revealing an institutional bias within the law enforcement agents in this case,” the HC had noted.The shooting happened on the evening of May 22, 1987, when around 45 elderly men and young boys from the Muslim community were rounded up by the PAC, packed into a truck, and taken away.Thirty-eight were shot by the PAC personnel with their State-issued .303 rifles. Some of the bodies were despatched in Gang Nahar (canal), the others in Hindon river. Bodies of only 11 victims were ever identified by their relatives. The remaining bodies were never recovered.The five who managed to survive the incident recounted the horrific tale. The Delhi HC rued that this case is yet another instance of “custodial killing where the legal system has been unable to effectively prosecute the perpetrators of gross human rights abuses”.“The prolongation of the trial for over two decades, compounded by the endemic systemic delays, have frustrated the attempts at securing effective justice for the victims,” it added.Anti-Sikh riotsThirty-four years after the mass killing of Sikhs in riots that swept the city in the aftermath of the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Delhi HC in December 2018 convicted Congress leader Sajjan Kumar for the killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar and sent him to jail for the remainder of his natural life.The HC termed the killing of nearly 3,350 Sikhs in Delhi, between November 1 and 4, 1984, and the rest of the country, as “crimes against humanity”. The riots, the court noted, were “engineered by political actors with the assistance of the law enforcement agencies”.It further observed that a majority of the perpetrators of the horrific mass crimes in the anti-Sikh riots enjoyed “political patronage” and escaped prosecution and punishment for over three decades.The HC noted that bringing such criminals to justice poses a serious challenge to thelegal system as the cases related to anti-Sikh riots have been dragging on for over three decades.It, however, remarked that such challenges were not limited to the anti-Sikh riots cases. “There has been a familiar pattern of mass killings in Mumbai in 1993, in Gujarat in 2002, in Kandhamal, Odisha, in 2008, in Muzaffarnagar, UP, in 2013 to name a few,” the Bench had remarked.“Common to these mass crimes were the targeting of minorities and the attacks spearheaded by the dominant political actors being facilitated by the law enforcement agencies,” the HC had observed.Genetic disordersThroughout the year, the Delhi High Court also brought in a series of reforms that benefited everyone.The HC kicked off the year with a verdict that ended discrimination in health insurance policies against individuals with genetic disorders.In February, the HC ruled that a person suffering from a genetic disorder needs medical insurance as much as anyone else. The verdict opened up a large number of ailments as claimable under medical insurance.“The exclusionary clause of ‘genetic disorders’, in the insurance policy, is too broad, ambiguous and discriminatory - hence violative of Article 14 of the Constitution,” the HC said.Most health insurance policies have exclusionary clauses that prevent the insured from getting a claim if he/she suffers from a genetic disorder.The HC directed the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDA) to take a look at the exclusionary clauses in insurance contracts and ensure that insurance firms do not reject claims on the basis of exclusions relating to genetic disorders.Substance abuseInFebruary,the HC called for expanding a section in the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act, which prohibits sale of intoxicating liquor to a child, to also include over-the-counter items such as whitener, thinners and vulcanising solution or sulochans.Section 77 of the JJ Act prescribes up to seven-year jail term for person who gives or sells any intoxicating liquor or any narcotic drug or tobacco products or psychotropic substance to a child.The HC was dealing with the issue of substance abuse in children. It said the consumption of such substances by children is with the object of deriving the effect of intoxication, but they not likely to be aware of their harmful effects.Inter-faith marriageA person who marries under the Special Marriage Act and then converts to the partner’s religion is entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of a Family Court, instead of the personal law for dissolution of marriage, the Delhi HC ruled in March.Giving clarity on the issue faced in many inter-religion marriages the HC stated: “When a person solemnises marriage under this law, then the marriage is not governed by personal laws but by the Special Marriage Act”.The direction came on a plea moved by a man challenging the jurisdiction of the Family Court, where his wife had filed for divorce, claiming that their marriage was governed by Muslim Personal Law as she had performed nikah ceremony after they got married under the Special Marriage Act.The HC dismissed the man’s petition.The Special Marriage Act provides a special form of marriage, its registration and divorce. A marriage between any two persons belonging to any religion or creed may be solemnised under this Act. Ruling that that Family Court has jurisdiction to “entertain and try” the divorce petition, the HC directed the Family Court to expedite and decide the woman’s petition for divorce.Begging decriminalisedNoting that criminalising begging was the wrong approach to deal with the underlying causes of the problem, the Delhi HC in August quashed provisions in the law that made begging a punishable offence.The act of begging in the national capital was made a criminal offence after the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, was extended to Delhi by a Central government amendment in 1960.The law prescribes a penalty of up to three years of detention in beggar homes in case of first conviction for begging, and the person can be ordered to be detained for up to 10 years in subsequent conviction.In India, 20 States and two Union Territories have either enacted their own legislations or adopted the legislations enacted by other States.“The State simply cannot fail to do its duty to provide a decent life to its citizens and add insult to injury by arresting, detaining and, if necessary, imprisoning persons who beg in search for essentials of bare survival,” the HC had noted.The court, however, did not touch the provisions in the Act that deals with penalty for employing or causing persons to solicit or receive alms.Aviation reformsIn a move to ensure that pilots and cabin crew members get the mandated rest period, the Delhi HC in April directed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to prescribe a specific flight and duty time limitation (FDTL).The HC asked the DGCA to strictly implement the provisions under the Aviation Act and Rules with regard to maximum and minimum flying time.Kerala-based lawyer Yashwanth Shenoy had moved the court claiming that the DGCA was allowing airline operators to stretch the duty hours of pilots under the FDTL, resulting in fatigue.Overbooking by airlinesIn February, the Delhi HC noted that the practice of airlines to ‘overbook’ flights — though recognised by the DGCA — cannot mean it has “the sanction of law”.Airlines commonly overbook their scheduled flights to reduce possibility of flights departing with unoccupied seats due to passengers with firm bookings not reporting for travel.As per data from the DGCA, a total of 2,879 passengers were denied boarding by various domestic airlines in December 2017 due to overbooking.A clause in the Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR), issued by the DGCA, lays down procedure to be followed if airlines are to deny boarding to passengers with confirmed booking due to overbooking of seats.Territorial ArmyClearing the path for induction of women in the Territorial Army, the Delhi HC in January said any provision that bars women from joining the force was against the fundamental rights provided under the Constitution.The Territorial Army is an organisation of volunteers who receive military training in order to be mobilised for the country’s defence in case of an emergency.The HC replaced the words “any person” in Section 6 of the Territorial Army Act, to include both men and women.Section 6 lays down rules on who is eligible for enrolment in the Territorial Army, which is also known as the second line of defence after the regular army.“The restriction of enrolment of women contained in the impugned advertisements and the claimed policy is neither reasonable nor rational and has to be quashed,” the High Court had said.A missed opportunityThe Delhi HC initiated several major reforms in 2018, but there was one missed opportunity.After a marathon hearing on the contentious issue of whether marital rape should be made an offence, the HC put the issue on the back-burner this year.The case was being heard at regular intervals while Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal was heading the two-judge Bench. The case has, however, not been heard since August — when Justice Mittal was appointed as the Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court.During the hearing of the case, the HC had refuted the Delhi government’s submission that striking down an exception in the current rape law would result in the creation of a new offence, marital rape, which is a legislative job.Noting that 52 countries in the world have criminalised marital rape, the High Court had remarked that the exception in the law — granting immunity to a husband — was “very wide” and gave the husband absolute freedom to do whatever he wanted in a marital bond.Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which defines rape, also states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife aged 15 years or above is not rape, even if it is without her consent.In October last year, the Supreme Court increased the age to 18 years.The Centre had told the HC that criminalising marital rape “may destabilise the institution of marriage” and would become an easy tool for harassing husbands.The next date of hearing is mid-February next year.This was a case of targeted killing... yet another instance of custodial killing where the legal system has been unable to effectively prosecute the perpetrators of gross human rights abusesThe atmosphere of fear created by members of the dominant Jat community was evidently so severe that the confidence of the members of the Valmiki community about their safety and security in Mirchpur is yet to be restored...There has been a familiar pattern of mass killings in Mumbai in 1993, in Gujarat in 2002, in Kandhamal in 2008 [and] in Muzaffarnagar, in 2013 to name a few... Common to these mass crimes were the targeting of minorities and the attacks spearheaded by the dominant political actors being facilitated by the law enforcement agencies..."

CIC slams Home Ministry for denying information

RTI request for 13 inquiry commission reports rejected
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Central Information Commission has slammed the Home Ministry for denying information on 13 inquiry commission reports on communal riots in the country. In response to an RTI request, the Ministry said it was not the custodian of the records sought.Charging the Ministry’s Public Information Officer (PIO) with “causing deliberate obstruction to the flow and dissemination of information…and not furnishing any reasonable justification for such complete inaction,” Central Information Commissioner Bimal Julka asked why punitive action should not be initiated.In his strongly worded December 27 order, Mr. Julka noted that the issue involved the larger public interest and directed the Home Secretary to depute a senior official to find out the status and location of the 13 reports and the reason for the denial of information within 15 days. In 2006, the Home Ministry had constituted a working group of the National Integration Council “to study the reports of the Judicial Commissions and Inquiry Commissions about the anatomy of Communal Riots.”Communal violenceThe working group examined 29 such reports, investigating the causes and course of communal violence across the country, from riots in several Madhya Pradesh towns in February 1961 to deadly attacks on a Kerala beach in May 2003.While the working group’s own report is on the Home Ministry’s website, only 16 of the inquiry reports it studied are available.Anjali Bhardwaj, co-convenor of the National Campaign for People’s Right to Information (NCPRI), had filed an RTI request in July 2017 asking for the other 13 reports to be also made available, with all their volumes and annexures.Not receiving any response within the stipulated 30-day time frame, Ms. Bhardwaj filed a first appeal. A day later, in a late response, the Ministry’s PIO simply dismissed the request saying that she was not the custodian of the records sought.“This information is available in the MHA as the reports sought by me were examined by a working group set up by the MHA,” pointed out Ms. Bhardwaj, contradicting the Ministry’s claim. She added that the PIO should have transferred the application if the information was held by a different public authority."

Six political personalities of 2018
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/six-political-personalities-of-2018/article25867686.ece,,,"Devendra FadnavisChief Minister Fadnavis single-handedly tackled the entire Opposition, and campaigned extensively to secure victories for the BJP in local body polls. For every protest he faced, be it from the Marathas, OBCs or farmers, he doused the fire through discussions and promises. He largely stayed clean, without any personal allegations of corruption. He handled the government and party machinery effectively. Suffering constant attacks from the ally Sena, he neither lost his temper nor gave them an upper hand. Often seen as impersonating the 'Modi' style of functioning, he has steered the ship well.Uddhav ThackerayMr. Thackeray managed to be part of the government as well as emerge as the most bitter critic and opponent of the BJP. Despite threats of his party representatives switching sides and joining the BJP, Mr. Thackeray managed to control the party. He launched a fierce attack on the State government, and even announced that his party would contest all future polls independently. Thus, he ensured that the Opposition parties in Maharashtra did not get the mantle they were aspiring for, throughout the year.Raju ShettyMr. Shetty, a farmers' leader and an MP from Hatkanangle in western Maharashtra, deserted the ruling BJP over its anti-farmer policies. Emerging as a prominent force for farmers to rally around in their protests against the government, Mr Shetty led protests in almost all districts of Maharashtra, as well as Madhya Pradesh and other States. Mr. Shetty's party suffered in-fighting and his former trusted aide joined hands with the BJP. But he remains a force to reckon with, as the face of farmers' distress in the State.Nana PatoleMr. Patole, a former BJP MP from Bhandara-Gondia constituency in Vidarbha, resigned from the post as a mark of protest against what he termed as the authoritarian functioning of PM Narendra Modi and the anti-farmer policies of the government. Mr. Patole then joined the Congress, but decided not to contest the bypoll. He, however, campaigned for the NCP and ensured that the BJP candidate lost the election. Mr. Patole is turning out to be the resurgent Congress' face in the eastern belt of Vidarbha as well as a leader representing farmers at the national level.Prakash AmbedkarBe it opposing the 'Urban Naxals' theory floated by the government, or joining hands with the AIMIM, Mr. Ambedkar remained in the news and at the centre of political discussion throughout the year. His call for a Statewide bandh after the Bhima-Koregaon riot at the start of the year, and his direct attack on right-wing activist Sambhaji Bhide sprung him into the limelight. His alliance with AIMIM has not gone down too well with Opposition parties. With his forays across the State, Mr. Ambedkar may turn out to be the spoilsport for many in 2019.Chhagan BhujbalMr. Bhujbal was nowhere in the political theatre as the year began, being behind bars for an alleged Maharashtra Sadan scam. But his release on bail in May changed that. Said to be instrumental in securing Upendra Kushwaha's entry in the Congress-RJD alliance, Mr. Bhujbal is now one of the most powerful OBC leaders in the political arena. The leader of RLSP, that recently quit the NDA, was Mr Bhujbal's aide in the Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad. The NCP may see a resurgence in north Maharashtra thanks to him."

The case has, however, not been heard since August — when Justice Mittal was appointed as the Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court.During the hearing of the case, the HC had refuted the Delhi government’s submission that striking down an exception in the current rape law would result in the creation of a new offence, marital rape, which is a legislative job.Noting that 52 countries in the world have criminalised marital rape, the High Court had remarked that the exception in the law — granting immunity to a husband — was “very wide” and gave the husband absolute freedom to do whatever he wanted in a marital bond.Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which defines rape, also states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife aged 15 years or above is not rape, even if it is without her consent.In October last year, the Supreme Court increased the age to 18 years.The Centre had told the HC that criminalising marital rape “may destabilise the institution of marriage” and would become an easy tool for harassing husbands.The next date of hearing is mid-February next year."

Driver of Opposition alliance wagon doesn’t even have learner’s licence, says Naqvi ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/driver-of-opposition-alliance-wagon-doesnt-even-have-learners-licence-says-naqvi/article25865594.ece,"
Naqvi said it was out of compulsion that some opposition leaders, even the experienced ones, are backing Rahul Gandhi.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Taking a swipe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi for his efforts to form a front to take on the BJP in 2019 polls, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Sunday the driver of the opposition alliance wagon doesn’t even have a learner’s licence and could drive it into a ditch.Mr. Naqvi also said it was out of compulsion that some opposition leaders, even the experienced ones, are backing Mr. Gandhi.“On one hand there is Narendra Modi and on the other is Rahul Gandhi, who works for four days and then he is on a picnic for four months, while Prime Minister Modi, in the last four years, has not taken leave even for four-and-a-half hours. This is the difference,” he toldPTIin an interview.Talking about the opposition alliance, the Minority Affairs Minister said a big coalition was being formed against the BJP and he has been told that National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah is coordinating it.Mr. Naqvi said the NC chief is an experienced politician and senior people should understand that the “person sitting on the driver’s seat of the alliance’s wagon does not even have a learner’s licence and (therefore) whether this wagon will be driven into a ditch or dumped elsewhere, the experienced people should know”.“Itne khiladi ek anari ke peeche chal rahe hain toh hum kya kar sakte hain(so many experienced people are walking behind a novice, so what can we do),” the 61-year-old leader said.Exudes confidenceMr. Naqvi also exuded confidence that the performance of the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls will match the 2014 showing.“Last time we fought the election on Narendra Modi’s ‘naam’ (name), this time we are fighting the polls on his ‘kaam’ (work),” the Rajya Sabha MP said.Asked if there was any merit in the opposition argument that the BJP lost the polls in the Hindi heartland states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh due to agrarian distress, Mr. Naqvi said the BJP did not lose any vote percentage and its seats have also not reduced drastically.“However, in the states we have lost, we will take a feedback and act,” he said.Agrarian issuesAs far as agrarian issues are concerned, the first budget of this government had the theme of ‘mera gaon, mera desh’ whose focus was on farmers, Mr. Naqvi pointed out.“From insurance scheme, soil health cards and neem-coated urea to MSP increase, several steps have been taken in the interest of the farmers. In the coming days we will do more,” he said.Asked about incidents of lynchings creating insecurity among minorities, the Minority Affairs Minister said that they should be seen as criminal incidents and not as communal incidents.“This is not only a crime but a heinous crime. State governments also deal with them as criminal incidents and take action against the culprits,” he said.No big communal riotMr. Naqvi emphasised that in the last four years, no big communal riot has taken place in the country.“Another important thing is that in any part of the country, no terrorist attack, blast or such activities, have been successful. I am saying this because when a terrorist activity takes place, people get killed, which is very sad, but innocent minorities and people from the Muslim community also suffer.“In the last 10 years (before the NDA government), wherever there has been a blast, young people (from minority community) were arrested and the innocent ones are now being let off by courts under this government,” he said.Minority communities, especially Muslims, are staying in the country fully secure and with a lot of freedom, he said.There is a fear among terrorists of the central government. There is peace in all places and an atmosphere of safety, he said.Mr. Naqvi alleged that there were “political forces” in the country that keep running a campaign of misinformation and fear."

A police constable was killed and several others injured in stone pelting during a protest by members of the Nishad Party
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Uttar Pradesh police on Sunday arrested 19 persons in connection with the violence and the death of a constable in stone-throwing by protesters in Ghazipur district on Saturday.The police accused members of the Nishad Party, an ally of the Samajwadi Party in the State, for the violence and also booked one of its general secretaries. Thirty-two persons have been named in the FIR, while 70-80 others are unknown accused, said ADG (Varanasi zone) P.V. Rama Sastry.The officer confirmed that the FIR named a Nishad Party general secretary as the “main accused” for giving the call for the protest and said the police had sufficient evidence against him. The FIR invokes charges such as rioting and murder.Mr. Sastry said he would write to the District Magistrate of Ghazipur to invoke the National Security Act against the main accused, who is believed to be Arjun Kashyap. The police did not confirm the name.Uttar Pradesh DGP O.P. Singh said 19 accused had been arrested in three cases, including 11 in the murder case. Describing the death of constable Suresh Pratap Singh Vats as “extremely tragic,” he said action would be taken against those involved. The constable was returning from duty at the PM’s rally when the incident took place.The stone-throwing took place during clashes that broke out when members of the Nishad Party were staging protests and road blockade demanding Scheduled Caste status for the Nishad caste. Mr. Vats succumbed to a head injury.Yesh Veer Singh, SP Ghazipur, said the constable was hit when the protesters started pelting the police with stones as they were “trying to clear a roadblock.”Sanjay Nishad, president of the Nishad Party, demanded a detailed police investigation into the incident and said the BJP was trying to defame his party with false allegations.Praveen Nishad, MP of Gorakhpur, and leader of the Nishad Party toldThe Hinduthat his party had no role in the violence. He claimed that activists of the party were staging a peaceful dharna when members of the BJP who were returning from the PM’s rally in vehicles started chasing and attacking them.“Local villagers came to the support of our workers and this led to an altercation. The incident involving the constable (stone-throwing) was the work of BJP workers,” said Mr. Nishad.Jungle raj, says Cong.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told reporters in New Delhi that ‘jungle raj’ prevailed in U.P.“When police, who are responsible for protecting and defending law and order, are under such severe attack, what will happen to common people,” he asked."

CIC slams Home Ministry for denying information on communal riots

RTI request for 13 inquiry commission reports rejected ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Central Information Commission has slammed the Home Ministry for denying information on 13 inquiry commission reports on communal riots in the country. In response to an RTI request, the Ministry said it was not the custodian of the records sought.Charging the Ministry’s Public Information Officer (PIO) with “causing deliberate obstruction to the flow and dissemination of information…and not furnishing any reasonable justification for such complete inaction,” Central Information Commissioner Bimal Julka asked why punitive action should not be initiated.In his strongly worded December 27 order, Mr. Julka noted that the issue involved the larger public interest and directed the Home Secretary to depute a senior official to find out the status and location of the 13 reports and the reason for the denial of information within 15 days. In 2006, the Home Ministry had constituted a working group of the National Integration Council “to study the reports of the Judicial Commissions and Inquiry Commissions about the anatomy of Communal Riots.”Communal violenceThe working group examined 29 such reports, investigating the causes and course of communal violence across the country, from riots in several Madhya Pradesh towns in February 1961 to deadly attacks on a Kerala beach in May 2003.While the working group’s own report is on the Home Ministry’s website, only 16 of the inquiry reports it studied are available.Anjali Bhardwaj, co-convenor of the National Campaign for People’s Right to Information (NCPRI), had filed an RTI request in July 2017 asking for the other 13 reports to be also made available, with all their volumes and annexures.Not receiving any response within the stipulated 30-day time frame, Ms. Bhardwaj filed a first appeal. A day later, in a late response, the Ministry’s PIO simply dismissed the request saying that she was not the custodian of the records sought.“This information is available in the MHA as the reports sought by me were examined by a working group set up by the MHA,” pointed out Ms. Bhardwaj, contradicting the Ministry’s claim. She added that the PIO should have transferred the application if the information was held by a different public authority."

Noida Authority denies that there is a special arrangement in place to avoid any congregation
",,"No prayers were offered at the Sector 58 park of the Noida Authority where water was being sprinkled since Friday morning and multiple teams were deployed to maintain law and order.‘Routine affair’While workers from the Muslim community pointed out that water was sprinkled here last Friday (on December 21) as well, Noida Authority staffers said it was a routine affair, adding water is sprinkled several times every week at the park.Meanwhile, some members of the Muslim community offered prayers at Noida Authority parks in Sector 63 on Friday.While the authorities denied that there was any special arrangement to avoid any congregation, the Muslim workers offered namaz at a masjid in Labour Chowk. Many employees could be seen having lunch in the park in the afternoon.“We were not allowed to hold prayers in Sector 58 but many of us prayed in Sector 64. We do not want to create an issue but just need a place to pray,” said Abdul, who works at a factory in Noida.A notice was issued by the Sector 58 police station SHO after large gatherings were held at the local park in Sector 58.Local SHO Pankaj Rai told the media that a notice was issued to 23 companies as over the past few weeks around 500 people would gather on Fridays to offer namaz, up from 15-20 people earlier.The police said the notice was issued to maintain law and order after some residents of Bishanpura village objected to the congregation, adding that on December 16, around 500 people, including many outsiders, had gathered there.After the order was largely criticised, the district administration and the police announced that private companies would not be held liable for Friday prayers by employees at public places.However, the DM reiterated that permission for such gatherings from the local authority is mandatory, citing a 2009 Supreme Court order.Terming news reports on the order issued by a local police station “out of context”, the DM said the local administration had not given permission to the Sector 58 park for religious gatherings and that the SHO had issued a letter in his own capacity.Religious clerics and organisations have slammed the Noida police over the “diktat” of holding private companies responsible for Friday prayers.Delhi Minority Commission chairperson Zafarul Islam Khan said that this was illegal and the notice should be revoked. He said that he would write an advisory to the UP government over the issue.All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat, a federation of various Muslim bodies, also termed the SHO’s order illegal and unjust.Political outfits like the SP and the BSP also slammed the order.Having dealt with the crowd confrontation earlier as well, the Sector 58 SHO is not new to handling clash between groups.Back in 2007, when he was posted in Agra, he had to deal with riots, which broke out after four men were hit by a lorry while returning from Shab-e-Barat.Mr. Rai said that he would stand by the order he issued, adding that his effort was only to help maintain peace in the area. Asked whether he feels the order could have been worded better, Mr. Rai said he would have acted in a similar manner had it been a Hindu congregation."

Speed cameras are in place all over the city. We have also imposed parking restrictions and No Entry on several roads,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Amitesh Kumar said.As part of a special drive, the Crime Branch carried out a search in suburban Andheri on Friday night and seized 945 bottles of imported foreign liquor worth ₹16 lakh from a car and arrested one man, the police said.(With PTI inputs)"

Five films vastly different in pace and temperament – yet bound by the theme of family and sororities – make it to our best of international films list
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Cinema can breed a peculiar rapaciousness—the more you feed on images, the more voracious your appetite becomes. In a year where I could feast on a lot more than usual, I still couldn’t savour a bunch — Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’sNever Look Away, Benedikt Erlingsson'sWoman At War, Marcelo Martinessi’sThe Heiresses, Tamara Jenkins’Private Lifeto name just a few.Of the lot that were seen, many have registered strongly in the mind’s eye. The many separations than the few shared moments between Zula and Viktor inCold War,Pawel Pawlikowski’s haunting dissection of the human repercussions of politics, of individual desires getting smothered in the grim march of time and history. Sergei Loznitsa’s political sledgehammerDonbassthat brings alive a depressing, dystopian vision of the site of war between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government and could well boast of the most brilliant climax at the movies this year. OrBurning,Lee Chang-Dong’s tale of obsessive love that casts a complex glance at contemporary Korean society, youth and the issues of anxieties and rage.From the political pugnacity of Spike Lee’sBlacKkklansmanto the hypnotic perversity of Lars Von Trier’sThe House That Jack Built;fromLeave No Trace,Debra Granik’s affecting take on choices and relationships nurtured on the fringes of societal norms to Coen Bros’The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, the darkly funny anthology Western on the unforeseeable theme of death; fromthe avant garde Jean-Luc Godard collageThe Image Bookto“I wanted to get another look at you” moment of Bradley Cooper’sA Star Is Bornall the way to the astonishing success of the low budget, loveable zombie laugh riot--Shinichiro Ueda’sOne Cut Of The Dead—a lot happened in cinema across the globe.These five films, however, were singular, and united, in laying bare the human condition and examining individuals and relationships with immense profundity, astuteness and wisdom. They were also, coincidentally, about families and sororities.A still from Roma showing the character of Cleo.  
| Photo Credit:TIFFAlfonso Cuaron’sRomaIt’s common to fall in love with a film but rare to get swept over by one.Romahas been that exception. Having viewed it thrice in as many months, on the big screen, as Alfonso Cuaron meant it to be seen, my impressions remain scattered, incoherent, grappling to find the right words. There is much that overwhelms. Cuaron’s intensely personal love letter to his nanny, that he has said to have made with memory as a tool, is indeed like a reverie on screen. Like it happens in a dream there is precision and geometry of arrangement to every luminous black and white image; the feeling, however, may not be as easily explicable, if not entirely evasive. It’s for each of us to read our own meaning—be it the aircraft’s reflection in the splashing water, the high jumps and the ginormous amount of poo produced by the family dog Borrus or the funny attempt to park a huge car in a narrow veranda. Be it the foreground or the background, there is persistent activity that fills the seemingly placid frames even as the narrative moves from one caringly mapped-out situation to another.There’s more to the most beloved film of the year. IfRomawere a piece of music then there is a particularly magnificent movement in Cuaron’s composition. Cleo is humming a song that goes, “But I was born poor and you will never love me,” while washing clothes on the terrace. The youngest child of the house pretends being dead after a shootout game. She plays along, comes to lie next to him, refusing to get up when he calls out for her. “I like being dead,” she says as the camera moves away  from them to present a larger view of several maids, like her, washing clothes on the adjacent terraces of the neighbouring upper class homes, with dogs jumping and barking around them, quite like Borrus does, around Cleo. Without getting tetchy, Cuaron takes down the behemoth of class divides, in one lyrical stroke. It all leads on to a dissonant scene much later where Cleo’s lover Fermin disgustingly dismisses her as “fucking servant”.Cuaron keeps rocking the bourgeoisie boat ever so gently. Here dogs and maids belong to same order in the hierarchy; in fact the dead dogs of the houses are perhaps better remembered with their stuffed heads bizarrely displayed as trophies on walls. The daily chores, the day’s work for Cleo never seem to end; one image flows into the other and even the most banal of shots has a place in the larger human story that Cuaron wants to tell. Like the lady of the house, Sofia, being unwittingly callous and cruel to Cleo—shouting at her for not cleaning the dog poo, using her as an easily available punching bag, asking her to make tea at the end of a tiring day just when Cleo is sharing a moment of rest and togetherness with the children. Then there’s Cleo switching off the lights in the entire profligate home while being ordered to conserve electricity in her own secluded quarters up the steep iron steps. Disparities are bridged yet stay well-defined.Yet, divisions also make way for strange connects. The seemingly empowered, Sofia shares a destiny akin to that of the hapless Cleo. Both are united in facing similar betrayals at the hands of uncaring men. One is an irresponsible wimp, the other basks in the faux glory of masculinity. “Women, we are always alone,” Sofia tells Cleo. They may both seem feeble, fragile and alone but will find a way. As many women like them eventually do.There is still more toRoma.It’s not just Cuaron’s critical gaze into male entitlement and his own privileged world but he also casts a wider look at the violent unrest outside in the country. The film is seamless in knitting together personal upheavals and political, social and cultural agitations into a nuanced whole with the personal and political, gender and class atrocities coming together direly in the persona of Fermin.Romais a sweeping, all-embracing tale about the intensely tragic turbulences that creep up in life, leave you shaken but also stronger and more resilient.There are films that serenade you for a while,Romais a keeper.Barry Jenkins’If Beale Street Could TalkThe rush and passion of young love, the rhythm, innocence and intense beauty of a couple’s first brush with intimacy, the delicate dance of the bodies... Barry Jenkins creates glorious romance on screen in a manner reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai. However, the lyrical moments of togetherness, the languid images are grounded in the unfair, ugly reality of racism and concomitant inequities. The tale of a young girl fighting to get her wrongfully confined lover out of jail before the birth of their first childBeale Streetis about separation and desperation and yet a perseverance and persistence of devotion. Families can bloom from across the walls of the prison, people can be together in separation, love can heal. Only Jenkins could have looked at the fractious issue of race relations in this characteristic gentle, genteel and abundantly graceful way. Underlined with the hope that, “our children can be free”.A still from Shoplifters.Hirokazu Kore-eda’sShopliftersAre families a biological inheritance or can we cobble them together as we move along in life? It’s a complex thought that lies at the core of a seemingly simpleShoplifters.A family of thieves takes a little girl, who has been hurt and abused in her home, under its wings. Will this love and affection that comes from her new parents and siblings last a lifetime or remain just a short tryst? Often called the true inheritor of the legacy of Yasujirō Ozu, Kore-eda has been candid about putting familial ties persistently under the scanner. In his own quiet, gentle and humane yet devastating way he weighs in on an alternative, surrogate family against the traditional construct but refuses to offer any convenient answers. Only certainty is a deep sense of loneliness and alienation.Nuri Bilge Ceylan’sThe Wild Pear TreeTextured and rivetingly shot in long takes, resting heavy on several probing conversations and resounding metaphors (like the persistent digging of a well), Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s ode to fathers and sons is the unheralded masterpiece of 2018. A young man returns home from college only to find it hard to fit back in to the family that has been battling with the debts of his father. He has his own worries about the future—being a writer and a teacher but without a job for the moment. Ceylan questions the family but also sees the futility of entirely negating it. Sons after all inherit from their fathers, a lineage is as much about ruptures as continuities. He also dwells on the centrality of religion and the conservatism lurking underneath the liberal veneer in the young. The young protagonist’s search for direction also becomes a reflection of the larger unrest in Turkey. A densely layered film,The Wild Pear Treepacks a lot in its quiet images.Yorgos Lanthimos’sThe FavouriteThree scorching women at its core and men turned perfunctory, the delectable tale of a strange sorority—Queen Anne, her confidant and advisor Duchess of Marlborough Sarah Churchill, and Sarah’s cousin Abigail Hill—is the most refreshingly wicked and irreverent film of the year. The ladies are brutally immoral, ambitious, manipulative and transgressive but not once does the filmmaker, or the audience, turn judgmental. The Anne, Sarah and Abigail triangle is less about love and affection, more about deceit and betrayals because relationships here are not sacred, merely a tool used for political one-upmanship. Lanthimos’ women are not just survivors but have a sharp killer instinct and believe firmly in the adage—self above everyone else."

Morning digest: Sexual assault on boys punishable by death, forays of the Kashmir stag, and more

A select list of stories to read before you start your day.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"POCSO Act: Assault on boys punishable by deathThe government on Friday approved amendments to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, to bring punishments for sexual assaults on boys on a par with those against girls. These include the provision of death penalty when the child is under 12 years and when a penetrative sexual assault is committed by a relative.The amendments approved by the Union Cabinet will now have to be passed by Parliament. An official of the Ministry of Women and Child Development said the government intends to introduce the amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha.Forays of the Kashmir stagSimilar in appearance to the European red deer, the Kashmir stag has a tiny white rump patch and a short dark tail. But unlike its European cousin, its coat is not red, but dark grey and dark brown. The local name, ‘hangul’, is said to have come from either the preferred food of the animal — the Indian horse chestnut (Aesculus indica), also known as ‘Han Doon’ — or its antlers (known as ‘heng’ in the local dialect). The hangul is known to favour ridges facing south, and which receive maximum sunlight, as resting places.Bulandshahr mob violence: U.P. officer was assaulted firstOfficer Subodh Kumar Singh who was killed during mob violence in Bulandshahr earlier this month was hit with a sharp axe first, assaulted with stones and sticks before being shot dead, new information on the incident revealed on Friday.Thepolice on Thursday arrested Prashant Natt, the person they claimed shot dead officer Singh after snatching his service pistol. They are now trying to nab others who assaulted the officer before he was shot.Rath yatras are not meant to kill: Mamata BanerjeeTargeting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for its proposed rath yatras in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said rath yatras are not meant to “kill people or incite riots”.“ISKCON conducts rath yatra here, it is Sri Jagannath’s rath yatra, not a yatra to kill people. A rath yatra is not meant to kill people, otherwise it is adanga(riot) yatra,” Ms. Banerjee said at an event at Sunderbans.Govt acts to check onion price fallThe Centre on Friday doubled the incentive granted for the export of onions under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) to 10% from 5% as a measure to help farmers, by stabilising the slumping price of the commodity.“This will result in better price for onion in domestic markets,” the government said in a release. “It may be noted that the onion arrivals have increased in the market at present due to which the prices in the mandis are subdued.”Opinion | The Transgender Bill defeats its purposeThe 2018 transgender Bill in Section 6 establishes a District Screening Committee for the purpose of recognition of transgender persons. This Screening Committee includes a chief medical officer and a psychologist/psychiatrist, which goes to show that medical and psychological tests would be required for grant of change of gender identity. There is no provision in the Bill that gender change would be permitted without medical or psychological treatment.The Bill also does not allow for recognition of gender identity as male or female. It only allows for an identity certificate as ‘transgender’. This goes against the decision of the Supreme Court.Syrian army enters Manbij in new alliance with KurdsSyrian troops deployed in support of Kurdish forces around a strategic northern city on Friday, in a shift of alliances hastened by last week's announcement of a US military withdrawal.Nearly eight years into Syria's deadly conflict, the move marked another key step in President Bashar al-Assad's Russian-backed drive to reassert control over the country.The latest buzz around e-commerceThe Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion on Wednesday issued a clarification to the existing rules pertaining to Foreign Direct Investment in e-commerce companies. The main features of the clarification include the provision that vendors that have any stake owned by an e-commerce company cannot sell their products on that e-commerce company’s portal.Another provision says any vendor who purchases 25% or more of its inventory from an e-commerce group company will be considered to be controlled by that e-commerce company, and thereby barred from selling on its portal.Health of banks set to improve: RBIIndian banks, especially those in the public sector, that have been reeling under stressed assets for the last few years, may have something to cheer about in the new year.This is because the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its annual ‘Trends and Progress of Banking in 2017-18’ report, pointed out to the revival in credit growth in the first half of current financial year, and said, “overall improvement in the health of the banks is on the cards.”Dhoni for pacers playing in IPL ahead of World CupThere has been a lot of debate on how to keep fast bowlers fresh for the upcoming World Cup, with suggestions like resting some for the Indian Premier League, that precedes the quadrennial event. It was something former India captain and coach Anil Kumble suggested here on Friday though M.S. Dhoni had some interesting counterpoint to that.Dhoni, who led India to WC triumph in 2011 said, “keeping our bowlers injury-free will be very very important. If you rest them, the first thing commentators say is they are rusty, and if you make them play, then they are fresh."

Mamata targets BJP’s proposed rally

A rath yatra is not meant to kill people, otherwise it is adanga(riot) yatra,” Ms. Banerjee said at an event at Sunderbans.Ms. Banerjee’s comments come at a time when the courts are to decide on the BJP’s petition to allow three rath yatras in the State. The BJP is calling it the Ganatantra Bachao (Save Democracy) Yatra, which will traverse all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the State.The West Bengal government has already refused permission to the yatras on ground that it can cause communal flare-ups.State won’t share dataMeanwhile, during her recent visit to South 24 Parganas, Ms. Banerjee directed officials of the State government departments to stop sharing data with the Centre. “From now on, we should have our own portals. And we will stop sharing data with the Centre,” Ms. Banerjee said, adding that in the name of data collection, the Centre was trying to control the State."

Noida park watered, cops deployed, no prayer held

Noida Authority denies that there is a special arrangement in place to avoid any congregation
",,"No prayers were offered at the Sector 58 park of the Noida Authority where water was being sprinkled since Friday morning and multiple teams were deployed to maintain law and order.‘Routine affair’While workers from the Muslim community pointed out that water was sprinkled here last Friday (on December 21) as well, Noida Authority staffers said it was a routine affair, adding water is sprinkled several times every week at the park.Meanwhile, some members of the Muslim community offered prayers at Noida Authority parks in Sector 63 on Friday.While the authorities denied that there was any special arrangement to avoid any congregation, the Muslim workers offered namaz at a masjid in Labour Chowk. Many employees could be seen having lunch in the park in the afternoon.“We were not allowed to hold prayers in Sector 58 but many of us prayed in Sector 64. We do not want to create an issue but just need a place to pray,” said Abdul, who works at a factory in Noida.A notice was issued by the Sector 58 police station SHO after large gatherings were held at the local park in Sector 58.Local SHO Pankaj Rai told the media that a notice was issued to 23 companies as over the past few weeks around 500 people would gather on Fridays to offer namaz, up from 15-20 people earlier.The police said the notice was issued to maintain law and order after some residents of Bishanpura village objected to the congregation, adding that on December 16, around 500 people, including many outsiders, had gathered there.After the order was largely criticised, the district administration and the police announced that private companies would not be held liable for Friday prayers by employees at public places.However, the DM reiterated that permission for such gatherings from the local authority is mandatory, citing a 2009 Supreme Court order.Terming news reports on the order issued by a local police station “out of context”, the DM said the local administration had not given permission to the Sector 58 park for religious gatherings and that the SHO had issued a letter in his own capacity.Religious clerics and organisations have slammed the Noida police over the “diktat” of holding private companies responsible for Friday prayers.Delhi Minority Commission chairperson Zafarul Islam Khan said that this was illegal and the notice should be revoked. He said that he would write an advisory to the UP government over the issue.All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat, a federation of various Muslim bodies, also termed the SHO’s order illegal and unjust.Political outfits like the SP and the BSP also slammed the order.Having dealt with the crowd confrontation earlier as well, the Sector 58 SHO is not new to handling clash between groups.Back in 2007, when he was posted in Agra, he had to deal with riots, which broke out after four men were hit by a lorry while returning from Shab-e-Barat.Mr. Rai said that he would stand by the order he issued, adding that his effort was only to help maintain peace in the area. Asked whether he feels the order could have been worded better, Mr. Rai said he would have acted in a similar manner had it been a Hindu congregation.We were not allowed to hold prayers in Sector 58, but many of us prayed in Sector 64.

Yogendra Yadav analyses outcome of the three Assembly elections ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Assembly poll results of the three Hindi heartland States have brought farmers to the centrestage of national politics, said Yogendra Yadav, a well-know psephologist and national president of Swaraj India on Friday.Mr. Yadav was concerned about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trying to divert people’s attention from real issues by raking up the communal narrative. “Be it the temple, Indo-Pak relations, another possible surgical strike or the appointment of BJP’s Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) in-charge and his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, the BJP could promote a Hindu-Muslim issue. I appeal to you to keep an eye on developments in U.P. as the Maha Kumbh is approaching. I have no proof but the Bulandshahar incident is telling. Millions are coming together two months before the elections in the most politically volatile State,” he said.“The results in the three States has opened up an opportunity to fight the Lok Sabha elections on issues of rural distress. This country has seen elections fought on democracy, emergency, corruption, Bofors, 2G, the temple, Mandal; but we have never really seen an election with a focus on rural distress,” Mr. Yadav said, at the Mumbai Press Club.Mr. Yadav predicted that if things proceed as it is at present, then it would bring a difficult time for the BJP. “No matter what the government claims, this is the most anti-farmer one in the history of India. There is a limit up to which you can feed people with slogans andjumlas(empty promises). Farmers know the reality,” he said.According to Mr. Yadav, the next general election will also be fought on unemployment and the alleged Rafale scam. “If the Manmohan Singh government was synonymous with jobless growth, Modi government is with job-loss growth. The labour bureau has suddenly stopped publishing reports to hide this fact,” he said.He, however, said that merely the existence of distress does not necessarily create anger among voters. It needs an Opposition to create that sentiment. “Whether Congress can do this or not is yet to be known,” he said. It was due to Congress’ inability to cash in on the extent of rural distress in the three States that people could not find it a better alternative to BJP, except in Chhattisgarh, he said.Talking about his party, Mr. Yadav said that his concern is more about driving the narrative during the election than to win seats. “The purpose of the I-can volunteer campaign is to ensure that real issues remain the focus of election campaign,” he said."

A shipping container as meeting room, a bus to relax in, scooters, taxis and street lights right next to you...architect Mukul Kulkarni is strikingly unorthodox. By Nandhini Sundar
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is customary to expect an office space to have straight-lined cabins, formal hues, and exude a sombre ambience. Even when a relatively cheerful lively ambience is preferred, the décor continues to lean towards formality, the tones more inclined towards conventional office spaces.But how about stepping into an office where you can cycle in, step into a bus to take a break, lock yourself into one of the telephone booths of yore to make a call, munch from a food van kiosk? A little hard to conceptualise and more so, actually walk through such a space? Architect Mukul Kulkarni’s design offers just that and much more, leaving the visitor literally gobsmacked.As principal architect of White Design, Kulkarni was given a brief for the design of a 50,000 sq.ft. single floor space of a software centre that clearly spoke of zero cabins, open plan, and expansive space for seamless interaction and collaboration. Kulkarni realised that to meet this brief he needed to come up with a design that was unique.Friendly neighbourhoodThus came up elements in his space that were hitherto unheard of, such as a bus, a taxi, scooters, food van, and a cycle, to name a few. The design was fluid, dynamic, the walls minimal, the spaces speaking of total transparency, the environment reflecting a community hub rather than a rigid demarcated office space. The concept opted was that of a ‘friendly neighbourhood’, the emerging spaces not just stunning but proving to be intensely productive for the user.Given the age group of the users predominantly being 23-27 years, the design Kulkarni came up with evokes fun and interaction while packing in a silent serious strain that is productive, contemplative, packaged in a green environment. Each section is lent a distinctive character, the individual spaces more experiential in nature, blending in seamlessly open and enclosed spaces involving open discussion areas and pods, video conferencing and training rooms, workstations, and resource rooms along with telephone booths that take the user back in time.Winding pathwaysThe winding pathways that mark the entire office connect to meditation rooms, break-out areas, amphitheatre, recreational spaces, library, central atrium, and even a crèche.The entire office is designed as 16 zones, each zone self-sufficient, with its own resource room, discussion pods, workstations, break-out space as well as coffee vending machines. Colour and art demarcate each zone, the colours tying in with the carpets layering the winding pathways that connect each zone.As in a neighbourhood, each zone incorporates small landmarks to serve as a guide. The landmark could be a vintage Premier Padmini, a set of Vespa scooters, or a bus covered in vibrant graffiti. Street lights, park benches, Bollywood posters, and food kiosks mark the pathways, akin to a normal neighbourhood street.Sustainability quotientAnd that is not all. Recycled materials too mark these individual zones, bringing in the sustainability quotient. A shipping container thus becomes a conference room. “The interiors are kept transparent by opting for glass tables and chairs such that the visual feel of being inside the shipping container is not lost,” says Kulkarni.Likewise, the bus doused in graffiti serves as a discussion area, invoking a fun element during serious work.The dynamic office also displays the presence of contradictory elements in the space, where earthy flavour merges effortlessly with the vibrant hues.Thus a riot of colours in the form of bright hues in the individual pods and demarcating panels sit harmoniously with exposed brick walls and raw, rustic textures in the open discussion nooks.While scribbling panels invite the employees to indulge and permit their imagination to flow unhindered, the differential patterns and textures that mark the entire office space elicit a sense of surprise and novelty, provoking creativity in every employee.Central atriumA sky-lit expansive central atrium with its food van kiosk serves as an irresistible space to unwind at the end of the day.A white amoeba-shaped table, representative of the unconventional design, sits at the centre, with its high table, bench, deck chair, and stools, permitting groups to use it in multiple ways as suits their fancy.The atrium further connects to an adjacent rock climbing wall along with a vertical garden, fusing in effectively the fun element with the work spaces.A notable factor is the per capita space availability per employee, the office housing only 368 employees even though it can ideally accommodate 500 employees.“It gives ample space for each to ponder, deliberate, wear their creative hats and log in exemplary work”, avers Kulkarni.Be it a fairy tale wooden bridge to hang out on and shake away an unexpected mind block or board a vibrant bus and tread back to childhood, or pick a chosen corner as the heart wills to work from, Kulkarni’s design proves to be truly an experience that evokes positivity and cheer.All about shaping a software centre that looks like a community hub and friendly neighbourhood"

Architect Mukul Kulkarni’s design offers just that and much more, leaving the visitor literally gobsmacked.As principal architect of White Design, Kulkarni was given a brief for the design of a 50,000 sq.ft. single floor space of a software centre that clearly spoke of zero cabins, open plan, and expansive space for seamless interaction and collaboration. Kulkarni realised that to meet this brief he needed to come up with a design that was unique.Friendly neighbourhoodThus came up elements in his space that were hitherto unheard of, such as a bus, a taxi, scooters, food van, and a cycle, to name a few. The design was fluid, dynamic, the walls minimal, the spaces speaking of total transparency, the environment reflecting a community hub rather than a rigid demarcated office space. The concept opted was that of a ‘friendly neighbourhood’, the emerging spaces not just stunning but proving to be intensely productive for the user.Given the age group of the users predominantly being 23-27 years, the design Kulkarni came up with evokes fun and interaction while packing in a silent serious strain that is productive, contemplative, packaged in a green environment. Each section is lent a distinctive character, the individual spaces more experiential in nature, blending in seamlessly open and enclosed spaces involving open discussion areas and pods, video conferencing and training rooms, workstations, and resource rooms along with telephone booths that take the user back in time.Winding pathwaysThe winding pathways that mark the entire office connect to meditation rooms, break-out areas, amphitheatre, recreational spaces, library, central atrium, and even a crèche. The entire office is designed as 16 zones, each zone self-sufficient, with its own resource room, discussion pods, workstations, break-out space as well as coffee vending machines. Colour and art demarcate each zone, the colours tying in with the carpets layering the winding pathways that connect each zone.As in a neighbourhood, each zone incorporates small landmarks to serve as a guide. The landmark could be a vintage Premier Padmini, a set of Vespa scooters, or a bus covered in vibrant graffiti. Street lights, park benches, Bollywood posters, and food kiosks mark the pathways, akin to a normal neighbourhood street.Sustainability quotientAnd that is not all. Recycled materials too mark these individual zones, bringing in the sustainability quotient. A shipping container thus becomes a conference room. “The interiors are kept transparent by opting for glass tables and chairs such that the visual feel of being inside the shipping container is not lost,” says Kulkarni.Likewise, the bus doused in graffiti serves as a discussion area, invoking a fun element during serious work.The dynamic office also displays the presence of contradictory elements in the space, where earthy flavour merges effortlessly with the vibrant hues.Thus a riot of colours in the form of bright hues in the individual pods and demarcating panels sit harmoniously with exposed brick walls and raw, rustic textures in the open discussion nooks.While scribbling panels invite the employees to indulge and permit their imagination to flow unhindered, the differential patterns and textures that mark the entire office space elicit a sense of surprise and novelty, provoking creativity in every employee.Central atriumA sky-lit expansive central atrium with its food van kiosk serves as an irresistible space to unwind at the end of the day. A white amoeba-shaped table, representative of the unconventional design, sits at the centre, with its high table, bench, deck chair, and stools, permitting groups to use it in multiple ways as suits their fancy. The atrium further connects to an adjacent rock climbing wall along with a vertical garden, fusing in effectively the fun element with the work spaces.A notable factor is the per capita space availability per employee, the office housing only 368 employees even though it can ideally accommodate 500 employees. “It gives ample space for each to ponder, deliberate, wear their creative hats and log in exemplary work”, avers Kulkarni.Be it a fairy tale wooden bridge to hang out on and shake away an unexpected mind block or board a vibrant bus and tread back to childhood, or pick a chosen corner as the heart wills to work from, Kulkarni’s design proves to be truly an experience that evokes positivity and cheer.All about shaping a software centre that looks like a community hub and friendly neighbourhood"

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Targeting the BJP for its proposed rath yatras in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that the processions are not meant to kill people or incite riots.“ISKCON conducts rath yatra here, it is Sri Jaganath’s rath yatra not a yatra to kill people. A rath yatra is not meant to kill people, otherwise, it is a danga (riot) yatra,” Ms. Banerjee said, while addressing a public event at Sunderbans.Ms. Banerjee’s comments come at a time when the courts are deliberating on the BJP petition to allow three rath yatras in the State.The BJP is calling it Ganatantra Bachao Yatra, which will traverse all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the State.The West Bengal government has already refused permission to the yatras on the grounds that it can cause communal flare-ups.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said that the party has approached the courts and is waiting for a positive response. The recurrent references to the rath yatra by Trinamool Congress clearly tell how scared the party is, Mr. Ghosh said.Meanwhile, during her recent visit to South 24 Parganas, Ms. Banerjee directed officials to stop sharing data with the Centre.“I am asking all State departments to maintain their own portal and no department should go to the central portals for data or share data with them. They [the Centre] are taking data this way, but not giving any funds. They are using the data for their vested political interest,” she had said.She accused the Centre of collecting about Rs. 40,000 crore from the State, and not sending any money for central schemes. The CM said that the Centre, in the name of data collection, is interfering in the federal structure."

High Court had rejected plea for extension of deadline ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar is likely to surrender before a court here on December 31 to undergo life imprisonment awarded to him in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case as the Delhi High Court rejected his plea to extend the deadline for surrender.Kumar’s lawyer said options are running out for him as the Supreme Court is not likely to grant a hearing to his appeal against the High Court verdict during the vacation, which ends on January 1. “We will comply with the High Court judgment,” his counsel Anil Kumar Sharma said.The 73-year-old was sentenced to life for the “remainder of his natural life” by the Delhi High Court on December 17 in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.In its judgment, the court had noted that over 2,700 Sikhs were killed in the Capital during the 1984 riots, which was indeed a “carnage of unbelievable proportions“.‘Political patronage’It also said riots were a “crime against humanity” perpetrated by those who enjoyed “political patronage” and aided by an “indifferent” law enforcement agency.The court had added there has been a familiar pattern of mass killings since the Partition, like in Mumbai in 1993, Gujarat in 2002 and Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh in 2013, and the “common” feature of each was the “targeting of minorities” with the attacks being “spearheaded by the dominant political actors, facilitated by the law enforcement agencies”.The case in which Kumar was convicted and sentenced is related to the killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar part-I of Palam Colony in south-west Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a Gurwara in Raj Nagar part-II.The riots had broken out after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984, by her two Sikh bodyguards."

For Prime Minister Modi’s home State of Gujarat, the party has continued with Om Mathur.Among others appointed to various States are Union Minister Thawarchand Gehlot for Uttarakhand, Mahendra Singh for Assam, and Rajya Sabha MP V.

",,"BJP’s newly-appointed Lok Sabha election in-charge for Uttar Pradesh Govardhan Zadaphia on Thursday said his goal will be to win all 80 seats in the State and dismissed any grand alliance of opposition parties against the BJP as an “exercise for survival”.“Opposition parties like the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress will come together due to their fear of the BJP,” said Mr. Zadaphia, who once was a bitter critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their Gujarat politics days.Now as a chosen man along with two party vice-president Dushyant Gautam and Madhya Pradesh leader Narottam Mishra by Mr. Modi and the party’s president Amit Shah to deliver a rich harvest of seats from Uttar Pradesh, the influential Patel community leader from Gujarat said, “My goal is to win 80 out of 80 seats in the State, nothing less than it.” He also hoped that the Prime Minister would again contest the Lok Sabha election from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.All in the pastIncidentally, it was Mr. Shah who was the State’s in-charge during the 2014 general election and engineered the BJP’s win in an unprecedented 71 seats.Asked about his bitter relations with the party in the past, Mr. Zadaphia said, “Individual politics can be played but individual’s ego should not be bigger than the nation. The past has to be forgotten and it’s now time to look ahead.”“The party is like a mother and if one goes away from it and comes back it will embraces you like a mother only,” said Mr. Zadaphia, who was the Minister of State for Home during the 2002 riots during which he had faced allegations of partisan behaviour.Back in the foldAfter Mr. Modi won the 2002 Gujarat elections with a thumping majority, Mr. Zadaphia refused to become a Minister, citing at that time the then Chief Minister’s alleged high-handed ways. He then formed his own party, MahaGujarat Janata Party, before the 2007 Assembly elections in Gujarat but it failed to make much mark in the polls.Before the 2012 elections, Mr. Zadaphia joined Gujarat Parivarthan Party, an outfit floated by his mentor and former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel. However, GPP managed to win only two seats in those polls and Mr. Patel merged his party with the BJP. Subsequently, Mr. Zadaphia also rejoined his original party.“Ups and downs are part and parcel of political life. What is important is my commitment to the ideology.

Datta, from the Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said it was a test in “flexibility” for the Congress and a significant defensive manoeuvre for the AAP.Professor Sanjay Kumar, director, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), hailed the possible alliance as a “formidable one” with the potential to, and, he said, perhaps the only way forward in terms of “routing the BJP.”Sudden wedgeWith AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal recently saying that the party would take “whatever steps necessary” to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, sources in the AAP said “some sort of announcement” could be made in January.However, Mr. Kejriwal has been facing resistance from within the party, according to sources. With that backdrop, some AAP MLAs in the Delhi Assembly tried to pass a resolution on December 21, demanding withdrawal of the Bharat Ratna awarded to late former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi over his statement after the assassination of hismother, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984.Denying that the resolution passed about the 1984 riots had mentioned Rajiv Gandhi, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia hadsaid at a press conference on December 22 that the AAP did not support the demand of some MLAs. When asked whether this episode would impact alliance talks with the Congress, Mr. Sisodia responded: “Which alliance? Where is the alliance? You [media] form alliances and break them every day.”Mr. Sisodia’s comments, however, came on the heels of media reports quoting Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel blaming Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken for coming between “any understanding” between the AAP and the Congress for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.“There is clearly a section of AAP MLAs, which is in favour, and the other which is not in favour of an alliance with the Congress for varying reasons. Some feel that an alliance with the Congress can help them bridge the popularity gap among constituents, which will come in handy during the 2020 Assembly elections. Others feel they will be overshadowed by Congress stalwarts and may lose their legislative seats,” an AAP insider said.‘Precarious situation’“Add to this a feeling of animosity that some MLAs, who already complain about how they have been fettered within their Assembly constituencies for over four years and feel further let down by not even being considered, forget being projected, as faces for the Lok Sabha polls and you have a very precarious situation,” the AAP source added.The Delhi Congress has been very vocal with its criticism of the AAP and has been accusing it of not doing enough to solve the sealing issue within the existing provisions of the Delhi Master Plan 2021, providing security to women and taking measures to tackle pollution and improve the public transport system.Mr. Maken ruled out the possibility of any alliance by saying that the AAP was the B-team of the BJP and that the party fielded candidates in Goa, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat andChhattisgarhonly to cut the votes of the Congress and help the BJP.However, former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said that the Congress high command would decide if there was to be any alliance.“Nobody has approached me and nor have I approached anybody regarding an alliance. The decision in any will be taken by the Congress High Command,” Ms. Dikshit said.The BJP however, according to its Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari, was looking forward to such an alliance which, he said, would “expose both the parties”.“Let them have their alliance and show the people [of Delhi] that they are not here to work for them but solely to wrest power and its perks; once they announce it, they will expose themselves to the average voter which, in our view, can only dent their tally of votes,” Mr. Tiwari toldThe Hindu.Expert speakWhile the events of last week have led to tensions, experts say the AAP and the Congress will both have to take a call on whether they should contest the seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi together or not.Mr. Rangarajan, a political analyst, said: “After the recent round of Assembly elections, the Congress looks more confident. Both parties will have to take a call. The question for the Congress will be, whatever agreement they come to for the Lok Sabha, what signal does it send for the future.”With Delhi Assembly elections expected in 2020, any agreement for 2019 would need to include a plan for it. The AAP had swept the 2015 Assembly polls, winning 67 out of the 70 seats, leaving the Congress at zero.For the AAP, whether or not it ends up aligning with the Congress will impact its future in Delhi. “The way the AAP handles its relationship with the Congress is a test of its political sagacity,” Mr. Rangarajan added.For the Congress, aligning with the AAP in Delhi would help send a signal to other regional parties, according to Mr. Datta.“It will be a major test of how flexible the Congress has become. It will send out a signal to other regional parties and can prevent the formation of a third front,” he said.On the other hand, for the AAP, an alliance with the Congress would be “very important defensive move”, he said, since the party has not fared as well in previous Lok Sabha elections as well as municipal elections as it did in 2015.He added that the Congress should allow the AAP to focus on its core voters in lower income communities, while the Congress may have a chance with middle class voters, who have “deserted” the AAP.According to Professor Kumar, however, the AAP-Congress alliance had the potential to be “even more formidable than the BSP-SP alliance.”“In the short term [that is only for the Lok Sabha elections] I would say there is no other way than going ahead with an alliance for both parties…they simply must go ahead…to my mind this will not only ensure a larger vote share for both of them but even trigger a rout for the BJP which is sitting with vote share in the 30s across all seven seats. If they don’t go ahead, I have no qualms saying that the BJP will win all the seats again,” Professor Kumar said."

The condition of Mohalla Clinics is such that filth and dogs have been found in many of them,” he said.The Kejriwal government has “failed” to keep its promises in Delhi, he alleged.Shah claimed that the Modi government had fulfilled all its promises for Delhi and the BJP will give an account of its work to the voters in 2019 elections.He added that it was “unfortunate” that the Kejriwal government did not allow implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi fearing Modi will gain popularity.Shah accused the Congress of “bungling” crores of rupees by using the National Herald building as “private property”.

The everyday bus riot ",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/the-everyday-bus-riot/article25807483.ece,"
Come, have the ride of your life, with its pains and gains
",,"Have you ever had a ride on a typical private bus in Kerala? If you haven’t, you are missing out on an adventure sport. It wouldn’t exactly give you the kicks of a mile-high roller-coaster, but would definitely hold up against some zig-zag skiing along the Alps sans the knee caps or helmets for that matter. These should pretty much be standard equipment on these buses, too.Boarding a bus is where the joyride begins. As you wave your hand, way into the middle of road, the loaded bus, titling dangerously to the right comes to a steep halt, thank God. The conductor who mans the door — for the uninitiated, he is the equivalent of the sophisticated mechanically operated doors: we pride in employing manual labour —swings it open with a loud bang on the bus body and there is a crammed multitude streaming out, mostly two people at a time because we just cannot wait.Rule No 1 of public bus ride: wait for the passengers to alight before you get on, looking on eagerly as you would at a shrine, the only rule we adhere to with god-fearing dedication. As we swarm at the door, our hands are already holding on to the railings and we are strategising on how to get in first and grab the only seat left. Once you finally manage to get in, you probably end up standing, as somebody raced you to the seat from the back door!Now, standing in a bus is a sport in itself. For a person of below average height, holding on to the sky-high bars above is near-impossible and you are at the mercy of the seat scaffolding if your hands can reach it through mob.As the cattle carriage (think Shashi Tharoor) snakes through the winding roads and the numerous bike-riders, swivelling past in a zoom, or the slow driver who refuses to let any vehicle pass, or the delightfully annoying autorickshaws which require no signal or care in the world to enter the main road from bylanes, just like that.And there you are standing, holding on to dear life, as the acceleration sends you into an animated back pull, while the sudden brake has you flying onto the person right in front, which has a domino effect till we smash on to the front handrail ultimately. It takes a bit of practice and unnatural balancing skills to hold on through the ride while digging into your handbag for change, since the conductor refuses to take no change for an answer.I think Metro is not doing too well here because we are too cool to let go of the rush that comes of these rides. The Metro is too balanced and steady, and tickets are taken before you board it, which takes the exhilaration and adventure out of the ride.It’s not all that bad; if you are a regular in a bus passionately named ‘Sonya’ or ‘Srambickal’ or ‘Ave Maria’, there is the small talk with the conductor, there are familiar faces joining in from each stop and it almost feels like family!From the perspective of the traveller, if you don't get a seat at the beginning, you are always on the lookout for a person ready to alight, constantly running algorithms in the head as to how you can scurry past to the vacant seat before the other person realises it has been cleared. The slightest movement of the bag or the person should be enough to trigger this fight or flight reaction. Then there are, of course, the schoolchildren with bag appendages almost their own size trying to squeeze into a safe spot. Backpacks are tools to nudge through the crowd and make way with comfort.But I enjoy the courtesy of the conductor and people in general to offer seats to the invalid, or the lady with the baby. We go, ‘oh, god, another, lady with a baby’ (we all do in our heads!) but we do find it in our hearts to smile as we spare the seat.If you happen to find a seat at the front, next to the driver, you might be able to catch a live chase on the highway as our driver would blare and tailgate the driving school car, the poor chap trying to keep the car steady for the least, in this mayhem that is breathing down his neck.I can remember bus rides when the rush was too much but more passengers would be packed in at every stop, thus everywhere was a place to sit or perch, more appropriately. The engine bonnet next to the driver used to a popular spot too, till ‘safety’ guidelines came into place!Wicked tactics to keeps school kids off buses, too. As they paid discounted fares and peak hours saw only a bunch of uniforms, not a pretty sight to the bus staff. The tricky drivers would either not stop, or if they have to, stop a mile away from the stop and you have to walk all the way back. And getting out of rush-hour buses, the struggle is real.This is a scenario everyone can relate to, Bus or Metro, how you have to rise from your seat at the stop before that of yours, and push and wade through people, bags and luggage through the crowded darkness towards the heaven’s door of light, just in time for the bus to reach your destination. That’s good planning, right there!Through all this there are monologues in my head. Where did she get hold of that stunning bag? How do the nuns sitting across keep their smocks so spotless white through the whole day?And then we alight and walk into the boring everyday chores. It might be hard, very erratic and tiring too, but I guess finding a bit of fun and frolic in every bit of the day is what makes it complete.shruthyme@yahoo.co.uk"

Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi are the greatest liars in the history of independent India, says Amit Shah
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"BJP national president Amit Shah, addressing thousands of booth presidents at the IG stadium in the Capital, said that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had completely failed to fulfil the promises he had made to the people of Delhi and that Mr. Kejriwal, along with Congress president Rahul Gandhi were the “greatest liars in the history of Independent India”.Mr. Shah accused the AAP of doing “drama” in the Delhi Assembly by adopting a resolution on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and likened it to “rubbing salt” on the victims’ wounds.‘Cong protected accused’He also hit out at the Congress for protecting a person who has been awarded imprisonment for life by Delhi High Court for 1984 Sikh massacre.“When the BJP came to power, we formed special investigation teams and assured justice to the victims. I want to ask why the Congress protected a guilty person and why it did not take action at the proper time,” Mr. Shah said.Attacking the AAP, Mr. Shah also said that Mr. Kerjiwal’s promises turned out to be his failures, as he has not provided marshals for women in the DTC buses nor had he installed CCTV cameras or provided free WiFi.On the other hand, he said, the Central government just after coming to power had completed the construction of National Highways around Delhi at the cost of Rs. 50,000 for controlling pollution in the national Capital.“We have also given in-principle approval for the regularisation of 1,600 unauthorised colonies. As many as 3,300 Sikh victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots have been given compensation of Rs. 5 lakh each. For the development of smart cities 1,331 crore have been granted for 71 projects under smart city development and under Amrut Yojna, corporations have been granted Rs. 200 crore each,” Mr. Shah said,2019 electionsHe asked the booth presidents to take a pledge to make the BJP victorious in 2019 Lok Sabha elections by spreading the “message of the success of the Modi government to every household”.Mr. Shah further said that the BJP would return to power in 2019 with a much larger mandate and that the party’s win would mean the victory of nationalism over casteism and dynasty rule.Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari called upon party workers to visit their areas and tell people that the Central government had announced medical insurance of Rs. 5 lakh each to 10 lakh families of Delhi under Ayushman Bharat, but Mr. Kejriwal did not implement the scheme and deprived the people of this benefit."

Book focusses on the change in a key perpetrator of Gujarat riots
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Dark memories about the pogrom of 2002 in Gujarat still give many a shudder, but if what independent filmmaker Revati Laul says is true, there is still hope left for humanity to live in peace and harmony.At the ongoing Kochi Muziris Biennale, she read out from her recently published book,Anatomy of Hate, which shows how certain perpetrators of the riots have over time reformed themselves.The book captures the incidents in the aftermath of the torching of the Sabarmati Express at Godhra. There is a need to write about them today, said Delhi-based Ms. Laul.“This book is not to show just the heinousness of human crimes. I primarily wanted to know where extreme violence comes from,” she said.The 232-page non-fiction published by Context/Westland profiles the stories of three men and their role in inciting mobs across Gujarat, where they went on the rampage after 59 passengers on the Ahmedabad-bound train from Varanasi were burnt to death on February 27, 2002.The trioMs. Laul was a television reporter from Gujarat during the riots. She said the book revisited the details of the murders through the lens of three key perpetrators: Suresh ‘Langdo’ Jadeja, Pranav (name changed), and Dungar.Unexpected replyThe writer noted how Pranav had reformed himself after revelling in the mob frenzy of Gujarat, 2002. It was at a social workshop, much later, that she ran into Pranav. “I was covering the event where historian Ram Puniyani was discussing polarisation and violence,” she said. “I remember turning my camera to the first person sitting in front of me.

Justice, forgiveness, and the call to forget
",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/justice-forgiveness-and-the-call-to-forget/article25808304.ece,"
Forgiveness can play a reparative role provided it is seen as complementary to justice, not a substitute for it ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Post-Partition, India has witnessed innumerable acts of collective violence of which three clearly stand out as the most barbaric: the Nellie massacre in Assam in 1983; the horrific slaughter of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984; and the diabolical pogrom in Gujarat in 2002.Need for retributive justiceNo society that calls itself civilised allows such mass atrocities, and if, as an aberration, such ghastly events do occur, its criminal justice system ensures swift punishment to those found guilty. But India repeatedly permits these catastrophic transgressions. And when the process of retributive justice begins, it is reluctant, painfully slow, and susceptible to political manipulation. Yet, whenever retributive justice has worked, as in the recent verdict on Sajjan Kumar, it has brought some ‘sukoon’ to survivors. It is unbelievable that justice delayed is still seen as justice affirmed.The reception of the recent judgment 34 years later once again demonstrates that victims of one-sided collective violence desperately need retributive justice, and not be deviously nudged to move on without it, to let bygones be bygones, to forget and forgive. Not surprisingly, it is perpetrators of violence or insensitive bystanders who say this. But forgetting is neither possible nor desirable. Traumatised survivors may be forced into silence but they can’t forget their loss or suffering. For a start, forgetting can’t be brought about intentionally; no one can wilfully strive to achieve amnesia. The more one goads oneself to forget, the more one remembers the brutality of the act and the loss of loved ones. More importantly, such a demand can’t be morally justified. Imagine that someone close to you was lynched in front of your very own eyes. Wouldn’t you be haunted by images of this gruesome act forever? Can the intensity of the initial trauma diminish with the passage of time if, for instance, you lost your only child to this collective insanity? Can the wound ever be healed? How preposterous it is to be asked to move on! Even when friends and family urge you to stop grieving, to try loosen the grip of this nightmare, they don’t expect you to forget what has happened but to find ways of rebuilding your life. To my mind, an appropriate form of remembrance is the only partial remedy for this lifelong ailment.Resentment and self-respectForgiveness is more complex. To forgive is to forswear resentment towards the person who has caused you grievous harm. Now, no one can seriously argue that renunciation of resentment is always morally appropriate and that one must always forgive. To begin with, one can hardly fault people for resenting those who have seriously harmed them because resentment is interwoven with self-respect. Only those without an iota of self-respect, completely self-estranged or benumbed will fail to experience resentment towards the offender. So, the relevant question is not whether or not to forgive but rather under what conditions is forgiveness appropriate. And the answer is: only when it restores the self-respect of victims. And when can that happen? Only when perpetrators publicly acknowledge their wrongdoing, distance themselves from the wrongful act, and join victims in condemning their own past actions.All this is mighty difficult, because it can come about only with a profound moral and spiritual transformation in the perpetrator’s personality. The experiential process of owning up responsibility begins with the gradual realisation that the wrongful act sprung from the deepest recesses of one’s being, that there is something deeply wrong with what one is. This requires a genuine confrontation with one’s self, not just in the mind but at the level of gut and feeling. Such honest, moral self-appraisal is gut-wrenching. As one undergoes this long-drawn-out, painful process, one punishes one’s deepest self, or, as some might say, one’santaratma,or soul. Only such punishment of the soul generates a profound transformation in one’s identity. No perpetrator is ready to seek forgiveness without it. And no victim can be ready to forgive unless this transformation is personally witnessed. Genuine repentance may pave the way for forgiveness. The victim can then say ‘he has suffered enough, let the perpetrator go’. This call to forgive has to come from within. It follows that no one can forgive under compulsion, nor can anyone forgive on behalf of the victim.Understanding forgivenessIt is sometimes claimed that forgiveness has the effect of erasing wrongdoing; that it is an invitation to reconcile with evil rather than conquering it. But this is mistaken because appropriate forgiveness follows an honest acknowledgement of the wrongful act by the wrongdoer and repentance before his victim. To forgive then is not to convert a wrong into a right. Nor is it identical to excusing a wrong, as when one excuses a child for causing harm on the ground that he cannot really be held responsible for it. Since the wrong is not simply whitewashed, to forgive is not compromise with evil.Forgiveness must not be confused with mercy. Out of mercy, punishment for the wrongdoer may be reduced without forgiving him. Conversely, a victim may forgive a wrongdoer but not be entitled to free him of legal accountability or seek a reduction in punishment. Indeed, sometimes it is the legal progress or outcome that triggers ‘a punishment of the soul’. When it does, it may be morally appropriate to forgive, should the victim choose to do so. Forgiveness indicates an alteration in the victim’s attitude towards the offender, not a change in the legal course of action.Victims or survivors can’t forget the wrong done to them. Justice is necessary to address the wrongs and alleviate suffering. But forgiveness too can play a reparative role provided it is seen as complementary to justice, not a substitute for it."

BJP attacks AAP for political opportunism and practising ‘drama politics’ ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Delhi Congress, led by its State unit president Ajay Maken, demonstrated outside the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) office here on Saturday protesting against a “resolution” passed by the Delhi Assembly seeking the revocation of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s Bharat Ratna.The BJP utilised the opportunity to attack the AAP for political opportunism and practising “drama politics” even as it accused the AAP of wasting the state exchequer’s funds on sessions of the Delhi Assembly where such events unfolded.It is very “unfortunate” that the AAP-led government “passed this resolution” in the Assembly,” Mr. Maken said. “Presiding over, is the speaker of Delhi Assembly, who was a BJP MLA in the 1st Delhi Assembly in 1993. Will not rest till Kejriwal apologises and withdraws this resolution! Call a special session [sic],” Mr. Maken tweeted.This, even as Deputy Chief Minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia, while denying lack of knowledge of an alliance between his party and the Congress, asked the opposition to look within.“What alliance? The aim of the original resolution, moved by MLA Jarnail Singh, was only to help the victims of 1984 riots get justice. No resolution mentioning late PM Rajiv Gandhi was passed in the Assembly as being reported in the media,” Mr. Sisodia said.“I just want to make one request to Mr. Maken and Mr. [Vijendra] Gupta. Those whose hands are tainted in blood from the 1984 and 2002 riots should better keep quiet in this matter. Those who do politics of blood should not say anything,” he said further.Union Minister and senior BJP leader Vijay Goel alleged the controversial issue has “exposed the two-faced character of the AAP.” “The level to which AAP can stoop, could be understood from the resolution it passed in the Assembly... AAP is merely shedding crocodile tears on the issue of 1984 anti-Sikh riots,” he said, adding that the AAP “was worried more about the alliance with the Congress” than the pain of the Sikh community.Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said, “It is an example of drama politics of the AAP in which public exchequer is being misused to make a mockery of the Legislative Assembly.”BJP’s Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta, claimed that the Chief Minister has “joined hands with the Congress” and wants to go back on the resolution, seeking revocation of the Bharat Ratna conferred on Mr. Gandhi, to “reach an understanding” with the Congress. “The AAP should clarify what its first priority is — justice for Sikhs or understanding with the Congress,” Mr. Gupta said."

BJP has betrayed A.P., nation, says Naidu

‘Even Telangana Chief Minister KCR is free to join the anti-BJP front if he so wishes’
",,"The BJP betrayed the people of A.P. and the nation, and it was the duty of all right-thinking persons and parties to join hands to defeat the party in the general elections in 2019 to save the country and protect the democratic institutions built carefully over decades, said Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu here on Saturday.He was participating in an interactive session at a conclave organised by a private media house.‘Democratic compulsion’Mr. Naidu said he joined hands with the Congress only to achieve the objective as it was the need of the hour, though the TDP did oppose the Congress in the past.“It is not an opportunistic political alliance, but a democratic compulsion which led me and my party to join hands with the Congress.”He said the idea of a federal front or third front (non-BJP and non-Congress front) was not workable.“Only once such a front came into power at the Centre. The United Front came to power in 1996, of which TDP was also a part, but even it was supported by the Congress from outside. Even after the general elections in 2019, every party has to choose either to be with the Congress or the BJP. Right now, the BJP is the biggest danger to the country. All democratic institutions such as the CBI and the RBI are destroyed be it. The RBI Governor resigned and in the CBI the top two officials were fighting each other in the court,” he said. To a question, he said even KCR was free to join the anti-BJP front if he so wishes. “I have always tried to cooperate with KCR for the progress of both the Telugu States. But his attitude is different,” he said. He accused Prime Minister Modi of “betraying the nation and Andhra Pradesh even more. He attended the foundation stone-laying ceremony at Amaravati. But unfortunately he is not giving funds. He is not honouring the commitments made in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, and the promise made by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the Rajya Sabha on SCS. He is totally negative in his approach.”He also reminded the audience that he had called for the resignation of Mr. Narendra Modi after the Godhra riots in Gujarat. However, keeping in view the interests of the State, he had aligned with the BJP in 2014, but none of the promises had been kept.To another question, he said all the Opposition parties would elect the leader after the general election in 2019, and “that leader should be acceptable to the parties and the people of India.” He said he did not have any ambition to be the Prime Minister. On demonetisation, he said it was a fact that he had advocated the abolition of 500 and ₹1,000 notes, but he wanted them to be replaced by digital currency. “Instead, the Modi Government has introduced ₹2,000 note. It was done in a very haphazard manner, causing enormous distress to the people.”Farm loan waiverOn farm loan waiver, he said it was necessary to provide some immediate relief to the farmer but it should be followed by other steps to make farming remunerative and prevent the suicides of farmers. Structural changes should be brought about. “We are doing that in Andhra Pradesh. The cost of cultivation should be brought down. We are encouraging zero-budget natural farming and it has won us accolades,” he said. Rebutting the criticism of the BJP leaders, he said the performance of the State government was so good that it had bagged several Central awards in spite of all the hurdles being posed by the Centre. “That gives the lie to their false propaganda,” he said.He expressed “100% confidence” that the TDP would win the Assembly and the general elections in 2019."

The court had said there has been a familiar pattern of mass killings since Partition as in Mumbai in 1993, Gujarat in 2002 and Muzaffarnagar in 2013, and the “common” feature of each was the “targeting of minorities”."

",,"The Delhi Assembly on Friday demanded that the country’s highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, be taken back from late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for his comments that tried to “justify” the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.Terming the riots a genocide, the Assembly also passed a resolution to “impress upon” the Ministry of Home Affairs to take “all important and necessary steps” to specifically include crimes against humanity and genocide in India’s domestic criminal laws.The resolution, moved by Tilak Nagar Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Jarnail Singh, further sought to direct the Delhi government to “strongly convey” in writing to the MHA that justice continued to elude the families of the victims of the “worst genocide in the history of India’s national capital”.The demand to recall the honour for the late PM for his remark “...whenever a big tree falls the ground shakes a little...” was made by AAP Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti during discussion on the issue prior to the reading of the resolution by Mr. Singh, who added the demand towards the conclusion of the resolution.“This House directs the Government of NCT of Delhi to impress upon the MHA that it should take all important and necessary steps to specifically include crimes against humanity and genocide in India’s domestic criminal laws, as recommended by the honourable High Court of Delhi in its recent landmark judgment sentencing Sajjan Kumar and other convicts to life imprisonment,” the resolution, which was unanimously adopted, stated.The House also resolved to set up special fast-track courts for “quick and time bound trials” in all pending 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases.‘Not part of resolution’In relation to the comments on Mr. Gandhi, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said on Twitter: “Lines about Late Rajiv Gandhi were not part of resolution placed before house and distributed to the members. One MLA in his handwriting proposed an addition/amendment about Late Rajiv Gandhi. Amendments cannot be passed in this manner.[sic]”Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken took to Twitter in defence of Mr. Gandhi: “Sh. Rajiv Gandhi sacrificed his life for the country.True colours of AAP have come out in the open! I have always believed that AAP is the B team of BJP! AAP fielded candidates in Goa,Punjab,MP, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh just to cut the votes of Congress and help the BJP [sic.]”."

Speaker of the Delhi Assembly Ramniwas Goel said the demand for revocation of the Bharat Ratna was not part of the resolution passed by the House.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said “no resolution mentioning late Rajiv Gandhi has been passed”. He rejected party MLA Alka Lamba’s claim that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had sought her resignation for not supporting the resolution. “Neither any resignation has been sought and nor anyone is resigning,” Mr. Sisodia said at a press conference, a day after Lamba tweeted that she has been asked to resign. Separately, Ms. Lamba told PTI, “I am not resigning.”The Delhi Assembly adopted the resolution on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots but the AAP swiftly distanced itself from reference to Rajiv Gandhi.(With PTI inputs)"

Designing the ‘unoffice’

A shipping container as meeting room, a bus to relax in, scooters, taxis and street lights right next to you...architect Mukul Kulkarni is strikingly unorthodox. By Nandhini Sundar
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"It is customary to expect an office space to have straight-lined cabins, formal hues, and exude a sombre ambience. Even when a relatively cheerful lively ambience is preferred, the décor continues to lean towards formality, the tones more inclined towards conventional office spaces.But how about stepping into an office where you can cycle in, step into a bus to take a break, lock yourself into one of the telephone booths of yore to make a call, munch from a food van kiosk? A little hard to conceptualise and more so, actually walk through such a space? Architect Mukul Kulkarni’s design offers just that and much more, leaving the visitor literally gobsmacked.As principal architect of White Design, Kulkarni was given a brief for the design of a 50,000 sq.ft. single floor space of a software centre that clearly spoke of zero cabins, open plan, and expansive space for seamless interaction and collaboration. Kulkarni realised that to meet this brief he needed to come up with a design that was unique.Friendly neighbourhoodThus came up elements in his space that were hitherto unheard of, such as a bus, a taxi, scooters, food van, and a cycle, to name a few. The design was fluid, dynamic, the walls minimal, the spaces speaking of total transparency, the environment reflecting a community hub rather than a rigid demarcated office space. The concept opted was that of a ‘friendly neighbourhood’, the emerging spaces not just stunning but proving to be intensely productive for the user.Given the age group of the users predominantly being 23-27 years, the design Kulkarni came up with evokes fun and interaction while packing in a silent serious strain that is productive, contemplative, packaged in a green environment. Each section is lent a distinctive character, the individual spaces more experiential in nature, blending in seamlessly open and enclosed spaces involving open discussion areas and pods, video conferencing and training rooms, workstations, and resource rooms along with telephone booths that take the user back in time.Winding pathwaysThe winding pathways that mark the entire office connect to meditation rooms, break-out areas, amphitheatre, recreational spaces, library, central atrium, and even a crèche. The entire office is designed as 16 zones, each zone self-sufficient, with its own resource room, discussion pods, workstations, break-out space as well as coffee vending machines. Colour and art demarcate each zone, the colours tying in with the carpets layering the winding pathways that connect each zone.As in a neighbourhood, each zone incorporates small landmarks to serve as a guide. The landmark could be a vintage Premier Padmini, a set of Vespa scooters, or a bus covered in vibrant graffiti. Street lights, park benches, Bollywood posters, and food kiosks mark the pathways, akin to a normal neighbourhood street.Sustainability quotientAnd that is not all. Recycled materials too mark these individual zones, bringing in the sustainability quotient. A shipping container thus becomes a conference room. “The interiors are kept transparent by opting for glass tables and chairs such that the visual feel of being inside the shipping container is not lost,” says Kulkarni.Likewise, the bus doused in graffiti serves as a discussion area, invoking a fun element during serious work.The dynamic office also displays the presence of contradictory elements in the space, where earthy flavour merges effortlessly with the vibrant hues.Thus a riot of colours in the form of bright hues in the individual pods and demarcating panels sit harmoniously with exposed brick walls and raw, rustic textures in the open discussion nooks.While scribbling panels invite the employees to indulge and permit their imagination to flow unhindered, the differential patterns and textures that mark the entire office space elicit a sense of surprise and novelty, provoking creativity in every employee.Central atriumA sky-lit expansive central atrium with its food van kiosk serves as an irresistible space to unwind at the end of the day. A white amoeba-shaped table, representative of the unconventional design, sits at the centre, with its high table, bench, deck chair, and stools, permitting groups to use it in multiple ways as suits their fancy. The atrium further connects to an adjacent rock climbing wall along with a vertical garden, fusing in effectively the fun element with the work spaces.A notable factor is the per capita space availability per employee, the office housing only 368 employees even though it can ideally accommodate 500 employees.“It gives ample space for each to ponder, deliberate, wear their creative hats and log in exemplary work”, avers Kulkarni.Be it a fairy tale wooden bridge to hang out on and shake away an unexpected mind block or board a vibrant bus and tread back to childhood, or pick a chosen corner as the heart wills to work from, Kulkarni’s design proves to be truly an experience that evokes positivity and cheer.All about shaping a software centre that looks like a community hub and friendly neighbourhood"

The agitators are seeking relief from government for the workers during the closure period.As a precautionary measure, the district police deployed over 3,000 police personnel from Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Madurai and Ramanathapuram.Huge barricades were put up outside the Collector’s office compound wall preventing people from entering into the office.

The Supreme Court had ordered banning production of “joined crackers” and using Barium Nitrate in manufacturing of crackers in order to control pollution based on a public interest litigation.The fireworks industry has decided to close down the factories after it feared penal action from district administration and Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation, the two licensing bodies, for violating the Supreme Court order for making “green” crackers.“No agency in the country knows what a green cracker is. Against this backdrop, closure of the units has hit the workers the most. The State Government has failed to effectively put forth its views in protecting the labour-intensive units,” said CITU leader, A. Soundarajan.As a mark of protest, shops and establishments in Tirutangal and Sivakasi were shut down on Friday."

It was the same slogan in 1984, in 1993 in Mumbai and in 2002 in Gujarat,” he said.AAP MLA from Okhla, Amanatullah Khan, added that if the victims of 1984 had got justice sooner, then “1993 and 2002 [riots] would not have happened”.Another AAP MLA from Kalkaji, Avtar Singh, sought details of the victims of the 1984 riots, saying “We will get some closure when we can know what happened to thousands of the victims.

AAP raps BJP, Congress over communal violence cases
",,"Initiating a discussion on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, AAP MLAs in the Delhi Assembly on Thursday hit out against the BJP and the Congress over incidents of communal violence in the country.Welcoming the Delhi High Court’s decision on Monday to award Congress leader Sajjan Kumar life sentence in the 1984 riots case, the AAP MLAs raised the issue of justice for the victims of the riots.Starting the discussion, AAP MLA from Greater Kailash, Saurabh Bharadwaj, said Kumar had incited a mob in 1984 after the assassination of the then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31 that year. “Kumar told the mob that they [Sikhs] had killed ‘our mother’ and to ‘kill the traitors’...The slogans were the same, the parties and victims changed. It was the same slogan in 1984, in 1993 in Mumbai and in 2002 in Gujarat,” he said.AAP MLA from Okhla, Amanatullah Khan, added that if the victims of 1984 had got justice sooner, then “1993 and 2002 [riots] would not have happened”.Another AAP MLA from Kalkaji, Avtar Singh, sought details of the victims of the 1984 riots, saying “We will get some closure when we can know what happened to thousands of the victims. Where were their bodies cremated? Who were the police officials present?”After several AAP MLAs spoke, the House was adjourned on Thursday. The discussion will be picked up again on Friday.Sajjan Kumar told the mob that the Sikhs had killed ‘our mother’ and to ‘kill the traitors’...

Muralidhar and Justice Vinod Goel refused to entertain the plea.In his plea, Kumar said he was “at present under shock and surprise” in view of the High Court’s decision to convict him in a case in which he wasacquitted by a trial court here in 2013.He said he wanted to engage senior advocates in the Supreme Court, where the HC verdict could be appealed. Kumar, who was on bail throughout the span of the case proceeding, said he never flouted the bail condition.“The applicant (Kumar) is the best person to brief his counsel and inform them about the facts. The applicant prays that he be granted further extension of 30 days so as to enable him to settle his family affairs to meet hisclose relatives, near and dear ones including friends who have been associated with him over a period of 73 years of his life,” his application said.HC judgmentThe case in which Kumar is convicted relates to killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar area within the jurisdiction of Police Station, Delhi Cantonment and burning down of a Gurudwara in the area.The High Court overturned an April 2013 judgment of a trial court that had acquitted Kumar, saying he was the leader of the mob and actively abetted the commission of crimes by his repeated exhortations to the mob to indulge in the mayhem and kill innocent Sikhs.The court, in its judgment, had said that the riots were a “crime against humanity” perpetrated by those who enjoyed “political patronage” and aided by an “indifferent” law enforcement agency.The court had said there has been a familiar pattern of mass killings since the Partition, like in Mumbai in 1993, Gujarat in 2002 and Muzaffarnagar, UP in 2013, and the “common” feature of each was the “targeting of minorities” with the attacks being “spearheaded by the dominant political actors, facilitated by the law enforcement agencies”.The High Court relied mainly on the depositions of three witnesses — Jagdish Kaur, Jagsher Singh, and Nirpreet Kaur — noting that the accused in this case had been brought to justice primarily on account of their courage and perseverance.Jagdish Kaur’s husband, son and three cousins were the five killed while Jagsher Singh was another cousin of Jagdish Kaur. Nirpreet Kaur saw the Gurudwara being burnt down and her father being burnt alive by the raging mobs.(With inputs from PTI)"

At the same time, it is appalling to learn that it took 34 years for this verdict, which describes the scenario of the justice system in our country.

The law will ‘take its course’ only if the investigating and prosecuting officials are allowed to do their jobs without having to take orders from the ruling party. The courts must shoulder part of the responsibility for the unacceptably long time taken to convict the accused. It is inexplicable why judges baulk at working with a definite time frame to wrap up cases. Is it too much to ask the judiciary to bring criminal trials, including the appeal processes, to a conclusion within, say, a decade?V.N. Mukundarajan,Thiruvananthapuram"

The flames gutted the outer portion of the shop. No casualties were reported.Eye-witnesses said what began as sparks at 10.30 p.m. escalated within minutes.

What the conviction of Sajjan Kumar says about the Congress ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"One of the low points in Parliament’s history is that when 2,733 Sikhs were massacred in three days in Delhi in November 1984, it did not pass any resolution condemning the killings or even condoling those deaths. This was despite the resolutions sponsored by the Rajiv Gandhi government in January 1985, within days of the formation of the eighth Lok Sabha, condoling Indira Gandhi’s assassination and the deaths in the Bhopal gas tragedy.The Misra commissionThe omission was compounded in February 1987 when an inquiry report on the 1984 carnage was tabled in Parliament. Misusing its brute majority, the Rajiv Gandhi government prevented any discussion on the report of the Justice Ranganath Misra Commission. This was despite its exoneration of the government and the Congress party and its leaders of any culpability. Such muzzling of Parliament betrayed the government’s own diffidence about the rigour of the clean chit procured by it from an inquiry conducted by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court. Justice Misra went on to become the Chief Justice of India, the first Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission and then a Congress party member of Rajya Sabha.It was not until the Manmohan Singh government tabled the report of another judicial inquiry into the same subject in August 2005 that Parliament had a discussion on the carnage. It was only because Parliament forced the government to accept the Justice G.T. Nanavati Commission’s findings that the FIR that has now resulted inSajjan Kumar’s conviction— he was Congress MP from the Outer Delhi constituency in 1984 — came to be registered at that belated stage.

The Nanavati report on the post-Godhra violence has not even been tabled in the Assembly.Also ReadThe slow, tortuous path to justice: Sajjan Kumar's convictionThat is perhaps only to be expected from a party like the BJP as it is, anyway, perceived to be ideologically communal. How different though is the performance of the Congress, given its pretensions of being a legatee to the secularism of Gandhi and Nehru? The conviction of Kumar this week vindicates the perception that the Congress has a long record of being opportunistically communal. If it took 34 years to convict the first political leader for Delhi 1984, it has a lot to do with the Congress regime’s subversion of institutions to shield the culprits in the early years.To begin with, Rajiv Gandhi did not deem the carnage worthy of an inquiry as he called it a “dead issue”. After deriving political mileage from it in the 1984 Lok Sabha election and the set of Assembly polls in March 1985, he yielded to the inquiry demand as Akali Dal leader Sant Longowal had insisted on it as a pre-condition for talks on the raging Punjab crisis.A whitewashSet up as it was rather reluctantly, the Misra Commission conducted all its proceedings in camera. Under the shroud of secrecy, it produced a whitewash. While holding that the Congress and its leaders were blameless, it conceded that its workers might have, on their own, participated in the mass killings: “The Congress party at the lower level — like any political party anywhere — has loose ends and from the fact of participation of people belonging to the party at that level it is difficult to accept the stand that the Congress (I) party had either organised or participated as such in the riots.” Citing the evidence of stray incidents of pushback, Misra claimed that had the Congress party engineered the violence, the situation would have been so bad that neither the police nor civil society would have been effective anywhere in Delhi. “If the Congress (I) party or a powerful force in the party played any role, neither of these two elements could have functioned in the manner each of them has been ascribed.”Using party resolutions to disregard the allegations made by victims, Misra said: “In the face of these resolutions of November 1, 1984, by the Central and Union Territory party organs, it is indeed difficult to allege, much less discover, unseen hands of the party behind the violence perpetrated so dastardly.” He also set much store by the fact that several Sikhs belonging to the Congress party had not been spared during the carnage. “If the Congress (I) party or some of its highly placed leaders had set the rioters to operate, one would expect the Sikhs with Congress base and affinity to have escaped the depredation.” Kumar’s conviction confirms the tenuous basis on which the Congress and its leaders had been let off the hook in the first instance. More importantly, it exposes the wide gap between the rhetoric and reality of India’s Grand Old Party.Manoj Mitta is a Delhi-based journalist and co-author, with H.S.

The Nanavati report on the post-Godhra violence has not even been tabled in the Assembly.That is perhaps only to be expected from a party like the BJP as it is, anyway, perceived to be ideologically communal. How different though is the performance of the Congress, given its pretensions of being a legatee to the secularism of Gandhi and Nehru? The conviction of Kumar this week vindicates the perception that the Congress has a long record of being opportunistically communal. If it took 34 years to convict the first political leader for Delhi 1984, it has a lot to do with the Congress regime’s subversion of institutions to shield the culprits in the early years.To begin with, Rajiv Gandhi did not deem the carnage worthy of an inquiry as he called it a “dead issue”. After deriving political mileage from it in the 1984 Lok Sabha election and the set of Assembly polls in March 1985, he yielded to the inquiry demand as Akali Dal leader Sant Longowal had insisted on it as a pre-condition for talks on the raging Punjab crisis.A whitewashSet up as it was rather reluctantly, the Misra Commission conducted all its proceedings in camera. Under the shroud of secrecy, it produced a whitewash. While holding that the Congress and its leaders were blameless, it conceded that its workers might have, on their own, participated in the mass killings: “The Congress party at the lower level — like any political party anywhere — has loose ends and from the fact of participation of people belonging to the party at that level it is difficult to accept the stand that the Congress (I) party had either organised or participated as such in the riots.” Citing the evidence of stray incidents of pushback, Misra claimed that had the Congress party engineered the violence, the situation would have been so bad that neither the police nor civil society would have been effective anywhere in Delhi. “If the Congress (I) party or a powerful force in the party played any role, neither of these two elements could have functioned in the manner each of them has been ascribed.”Using party resolutions to disregard the allegations made by victims, Misra said: “In the face of these resolutions of November 1, 1984, by the Central and Union Territory party organs, it is indeed difficult to allege, much less discover, unseen hands of the party behind the violence perpetrated so dastardly.” He also set much store by the fact that several Sikhs belonging to the Congress party had not been spared during the carnage. “If the Congress (I) party or some of its highly placed leaders had set the rioters to operate, one would expect the Sikhs with Congress base and affinity to have escaped the depredation.” Kumar’s conviction confirms the tenuous basis on which the Congress and its leaders had been let off the hook in the first instance. More importantly, it exposes the wide gap between the rhetoric and reality of India’s Grand Old Party.Manoj Mitta is a Delhi-based journalist and co-author, with H.S.

Trial in many anti-Sikh riots cases yet to be completed ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/trial-in-many-anti-sikh-riots-cases-yet-to-be-completed/article25777956.ece,"
Centre constituted SIT in 2015 for reinvestigating the cases ",,"Thirty-four years after riots broke out in the Capital in the aftermath of assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, killing over 2,700 Sikhs, the trial in a number of cases is yet to see its logical conclusion.On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court convicted Congress leader Sajjan Kumar for killing five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar area during the anti-Sikh riots and sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life. However, this is not the only case Mr. Kumar is currently facing in connection with the 1984 riots.Recently, a witness had told a local court here that she saw him addressing the crowd in the Sultanpuri area that Sikhs had killed “our mother” and instigated the mob to kill them. The next date of the case hearing is December 20.Another Congress leader Jagdish Tytler too is facing trial at a local court here in connection with riots at Gurdwara Pulbangash in North Delhi where three people were killed. Mr. Tytler was thrice given a clean chit by the CBI in the case, but the agency was directed by the court to further investigate the matter after the victims filed a protest petition challenging the agency's closure report in the case.In February 2015, the Centre constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) for re-investigating the serious criminal cases which were filed in Delhi in connection with the 1984 riots and have since been closed. A total of 293 cases were taken up for re-investigation.The three-member SIT is also probing Mr. Kumar’s alleged role in two other cases. One of them is the twin murders of a man and his son in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh.In November, a local court awarded death sentence to a man for the murder of two men in south Delhi’s Mahipalpur. This was one of the five cases in which the SIT had filed a charge-sheet."

Though the SAD was not contesting the panchayat elections on the party symbol, party workers aligned with it were not allowed to enter government offices to file their nominations and were not being given no due certificates,” said the resolution.Mr. Badal also asked why Congress chief Rahul Gandhi was “afraid” of taking action against senior party leaders Jagdish Tytler and Kamal Nath for their alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.(with PTI inputs)"

Slow wheel of justice
",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/letters/slow-wheel-of-justice/article25776684.ece,,,"The Delhi High Court’s award of life imprisonment to Congress leader Sajjan Kumar for his role in the Sikh riots of 1984 has not only brought relief to the survivors and families but also redeemed our faith in the judiciary (Page 1, “Cong. leader Sajjan Kumar gets life term in anti-Sikh riots case”, December 18). The nation looks forward to a similar dispensation of justice to those affected in the Gujarat riots of 2002 too, where the role of the State government came in for severe criticism by the Supreme Court. One cannot forget its lines that alluded to “modern day Neros looking elsewhere” when people were burning and “probably deliberating on how the perpetrators of the crime could be saved or protected”. When violence is unleashed against the minorities under the tacit approval of the state, suppression or erasure of evidence by those in authority is to be expected. The courts should go the extra mile in unearthing proof to nail the guilty by treating such offences as a “crime against humanity”.K. Natarajan,MaduraiThe verdict spells hope even after the passage of time. One only hopes that the same fervour applies to the perpetrators of the 2002 Gujarat pogrom The rumoured involvement of people in high places in all these cases and many more needs to be thoroughly investigated and the guilty punished in spite of the high positions they hold in government or a political party.G.B. Sivanandam,CoimbatoreIt is most tragic that political patronage, administrative complicity and muscle power suppress the truth irrespective of the political party or alliance in power. And the police, who are supposed to bring out the truth, appear to be hand-in-glove with the political class. This verdict only makes us raise our eyebrows as it has taken the judiciary over 30 years to ensure some justice for the families. There needs to be a separate law for crimes against humanity and genocide. Waiting for decades to ensure truth and justice is a bigger crime.J.P. Reddy,Nalgonda, TelanganaIt is a shame that even after adopting the Universal Declaration for Human Rights, the Genocide Convention and signing the Convention for the Prohibition of Torture, laws that deal with the prohibition of torture and genocide are not reflected in our legal system. Such specific laws are inviolable and a state cannot derogate from such an obligation of protection even in times of war. There is a need now more than ever before to promulgate such laws. Further, there is a need to establish robust procedural laws that deal with riots and mass murders.Models such as the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals or recent examples such as the tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia can be emulated to quicken the disposal of cases involving mass murders. Perhaps if the government had chosen to set up such a tribunal in 1984, it would not have taken decades for this verdict. Finally, none of this will be possible without collective political commitment.Surya Rajkumar,Sonipat, HaryanaThe verdict comes as a breath of fresh air in these choked times and is a reminder not to lose faith in justice prevailing. There are a few who still persevere and never lose patience. Jagdish Kaur is the stuff that legends are made of.Sangeeta Kampani,New Delhi"

The slow, tortuous path to justice: Sajjan Kumar's conviction
",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-slow-tortuous-path-to-justice-sajjan-kumars-conviction/article25776130.ece,"
The Delhi High Court judgment convicting Sajjan Kumar reminds the country that it must not forget mass killings ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Sajjan Kumar is likely to spend New Year’s Day, in 2019, in prison. Thirty-four years after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the killings of Sikhs that followed, a political leader who may have electorally benefitted from communal violencehas been sentenced to imprisonment for life.The wheel of history has turned ever so slowly, as some believe, but its arc may have yet turned towards justice. The assassination of Indira Gandhi, on October 31, 1984, was a national tragedy. The anti-Sikh pogrom that followed in north India, with the worst violence taking place in Delhi, was a greater tragedy. But the greatest tragedy of all was the stonewalling of investigation by the law enforcement agencies, and the seeming deafness of the justice delivery system. The judgment reconstructs the scene of violence and all the waiting that followed.Maze of inquiriesIt took years of commissions of inquiry and other inquiries before six accused, including Sajjan Kumar, a formidable Congress leader in Delhi, who was a member of Parliament at the time, were sent up for trial some time in 2010. Three years later, the trial court convicted five of the accused: three of them for the offences of armed rioting and murder, and two of them for the offence of armed rioting. Kumar stood acquitted by the trial court of all offences. Those convicted as well as the Central Bureau of Investigation appealed to the Delhi High Court. Now, the Bench of Justices S. Muralidhar and Vinod Goel has overturned the April 2013 judgment of the trial court, and sent Kumar to prison for life. Their judgment carries the echo of the crimes committed in the days after Mrs. Gandhi’s assassination and failure to hold the guilty to account for so long.Also Read1984 anti-Sikh riots accused had political cover: HCThe judgment finds: “The accused in this case have been brought to justice primarily on account of the courage and perseverance of three eyewitnesses. Jagdish Kaurwhose husband, son and three cousins were the five killed; Jagsher Singh, another cousin of Jagdish Kaur, and Nirpreet Kaur who saw the Gurudwara being burnt down and her father being burnt alive by the raging mobs. It is only after the CBI entered the scene, that they were able to be assured and they spoke up. Admirably, they stuck firm to their truth at the trial.”Staying the courseAs a result of their testimony, Sajjan Kumar now stands convicted for conspiracy to murder and for the abetment of murder, in the deaths of Kehar Singh and his 18-year-old son Gurpreet Singh, and the killings of Raghuvinder Singh, Narender Pal Singh, and Kuldeep Singh — all members of the same family. I mention the names of the dead because the dead in communal violence should not lose their vestigial humanity by being simply reduced to a score of unnamed victims.Kehar Singh’s wife, Jagdish Kaur, was one of the principal witnesses against Sajjan Kumar. The other principal witness is her cousin Jagsher Singh, whose brothers Raghuvinder and Narender Pal Singh were also killed on November 1, 1984. The high court judgment notes Jagdish Kaur’s recollection: “At around 9 am on 2nd November 1984, when she went to lodge a report at the PP, she saw that a public meeting was taking place which was attended by A-1 who was the local Member of Parliament (MP). She heard him declare, “Sikhsala ek nahin bachna chahiye,joHindubhai unko sharan deta hai, uska ghar bhi jala do aur unko bhi maro.”The judgment records Jagsher Singh’s recollection that “around 10 p.m., he saw an Ambassador car which stopped at the turning onto Shiv Mandir Marg. He stated that 30-40 persons gathered around the car from which emerged A-1 who enquired as to whether ‘they have done the work’. Thereafter, it is stated, A-1 approached the house of PW-6 (Jagsher Singh) to inspect it and came back and told the assembled mob that they had ‘only broken the gate of the thekedars’ house’. One of the members of the mob then allegedly informed him that ‘the thekedars are being saved by the Hindus only’. Upon hearing this, A-1 is stated to have instructed the mob to burn the houses of the Hindus who were sheltering the Sikhs. He then left in his car.”The court rules: “To this Court, PW-1 [Jagdish Kaur] comes across as a fearless and truthful witness. Till she was absolutely certain that her making statements will serve a purpose, she did not come forward to do so. This is understandable given the fact that all previous attempts at securing justice for the victims had failed. The large number of acquittals in the cases demonstrated how the investigation was completely botched-up. It also demonstrated the power and influence of the accused and how witnesses could easily be won over. The atmosphere of distrust created as a result of these developments would have dissuaded the victims from coming forward to speak about what they knew. In the context of these cases, the factum of delay cannot be used to the advantage of the accused but would, in fact, explain the minor contradictions and inconsistencies in the statements of the key eye-witnesses in the present case. Nothing in the deposition of PW-1 points to either untruthfulness or unreliability. Her evidence deserves acceptance.”A moment of reflectionSajjan Kumar is not very different from many other politicians of this era, who use mob emotions to ride to power. However, he is probably the first to be held guilty of conspiring with the mob to cause the deaths of his constituents. It is for us as a country to ensure that mob violence yields no political dividends. If we as voters decide to electorally punish those who incite mobs, yield to them, or fail to stop their violence, the resort to politics of mass murders will simply stop. The judgment notes that “there has been a familiar pattern of mass killings in Mumbai in 1993, in Gujarat in 2002, in Kandhamal, Odisha in 2008, in Muzaffarnagar in U.P. in 2013 to name a few. Common to these mass crimes were the targeting of minorities and the attacks spearheaded by the dominant political actors being facilitated by the law enforcement agencies. The criminals responsible for the mass crimes have enjoyed political patronage and managed to evade prosecution and punishment.”It also says: “While it is undeniable that it has taken over three decades to bring the accused in this case to justice, and that our criminal justice system stands severely tested in that process, it is essential, in a democracy governed by the rule of law to be able to call out those responsible for such mass crimes. It is important to assure those countless victims waiting patiently that despite the challenges, truth will prevail and justice will be done.”While the 1984, 1993, 2002, 2008 and 2013 riots are painful episodes in our history, the judgments of the Delhi High Court of 2018 in the Sajjan Kumar and Hashimpura cases shine like good deeds in a naughty world. Milan Kundera wrote that “the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting”. The judgment tells Kehar Singh, Gurpreet Singh, Raghuvinder Singh, Narender Pal Singh and Kuldeep Singh, that neither Jagdish Kaur nor India have as yet forgotten them.Sanjay Hegde is a senior advocate of the Supreme Court"

Court says this should apply irrespective of the gravity of the crime in case of a flawed investigation
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The benefit of the doubt in cases based on a flawed police investigation must favour the accused irrespective of the gravity of the crime, the Supreme Court held in a recent judgment in a 17-year-old case of murder and rioting in Uttar Pradesh.“The accused cannot be expected to relinquish his innocence at the hands of an inefficacious prosecution, which is ridden with investigative deficiencies,” a Bench of Justices N.V. Ramana and Mohan M. Shantanagoudar observed in a verdict pronounced on December 10. “The benefit of doubt arising out of such inefficient investigation, must be bestowed upon the accused,” the court ruled.“The cumulative effect of investigative lapses fortifies the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused,” Justice Ramana wrote for the Bench, dismissing the appeal of the Uttar Pradesh government against the acquittal of Wasif Haider and others. In 2001, a mob of 200-300 unidentified persons had gone on a rampage in Kanpur’s Chaubey Gola temple area, with the rioters opening fire at police personnel killing a senior officer and injuring another.Produced in a test identification parade, the accused were arrested on the basis of witnesses testimony. While the Kanpur trial court held the accused to be guilty in 2004, the High Court acquitted them citing contradictions in the testimonies of the witnesses.When the State appealed in the Supreme Court, Kamini Jaiswal and Siddhartha Dave, appearing for the accused, argued that the witnesses were at a great distance from the place of occurrence and it was not plausible to identify the accused. The court agreed that the case “is ridden with multiple investigative lapses and flaws, which goes to the root of the matter.”"

",,"Thirty-four years after riots broke out in the Capital in the aftermath of assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, killing over 2,700 Sikhs, the trial in a number of cases is yet to see its logical conclusion.On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court convicted Congress leader Sajjan Kumar for killing five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar area during the anti-Sikh riots and sent him to imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life. However, this is not the only case Mr. Kumar is currently facing in connection with the 1984 riots.Recently, a witness had told a local court here that she saw him addressing the crowd in the Sultanpuri area that Sikhs had killed “our mother” and instigated the mob to kill them. The next date of the case hearing is December 20.Another Congress leader Jagdish Tytler too is facing trial at a local court here in connection with riots at Gurdwara Pulbangash in North Delhi where three people were killed. Mr. Tytler was thrice given a clean chit by the CBI in the case, but the agency was directed by the court to further investigate the matter after the victims filed a protest petition challenging the agency's closure report in the case.In February 2015, the Centre constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) for re-investigating the serious criminal cases which were filed in Delhi in connection with the 1984 riots and have since been closed. A total of 293 cases were taken up for re-investigation.The three-member SIT is also probing Mr. Kumar’s alleged role in two other cases. One of them is the twin murders of a man and his son in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh.In November, a local court awarded death sentence to a man for the murder of two men in south Delhi’s Mahipalpur during the 1984 riots. This was one of the five cases in which the SIT had filed a charge-sheet."

The slow, tortuous path to justice

The Delhi High Court judgment convicting Sajjan Kumar reminds the country that it must not forget mass killings
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Sajjan Kumar is likely to spend New Year’s Day, in 2019, in prison. Thirty-four years after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the killings of Sikhs that followed, a political leader who may have electorally benefitted from communal violence has been sentenced to imprisonment for life. The wheel of history has turned ever so slowly, as some believe, but its arc may have yet turned towards justice. The assassination of Indira Gandhi, on October 31, 1984, was a national tragedy. The anti-Sikh pogrom that followed in north India, with the worst violence taking place in Delhi, was a greater tragedy. But the greatest tragedy of all was the stonewalling of investigation by the law enforcement agencies, and the seeming deafness of the justice delivery system. The judgment reconstructs the scene of violence and all the waiting that followed.Maze of inquiriesIt took years of commissions of inquiry and other inquiries before six accused, including Sajjan Kumar, a formidable Congress leader in Delhi, who was a member of Parliament at the time, were sent up for trial some time in 2010. Three years later, the trial court convicted five of the accused: three of them for the offences of armed rioting and murder, and two of them for the offence of armed rioting. Kumar stood acquitted by the trial court of all offences. Those convicted as well as the Central Bureau of Investigation appealed to the Delhi High Court. Now, the Bench of Justices S. Muralidhar and Vinod Goel has overturned the April 2013 judgment of the trial court, and sent Kumar to prison for life. Their judgment carries the echo of the crimes committed in the days after Mrs. Gandhi’s assassination and failure to hold the guilty to account for so long.The judgment finds: “The accused in this case have been brought to justice primarily on account of the courage and perseverance of three eyewitnesses. Jagdish Kaur (picture) whose husband, son and three cousins were the five killed; Jagsher Singh, another cousin of Jagdish Kaur, and Nirpreet Kaur who saw the Gurudwara being burnt down and her father being burnt alive by the raging mobs. It is only after the CBI entered the scene, that they were able to be assured and they spoke up. Admirably, they stuck firm to their truth at the trial.”Staying the courseAs a result of their testimony, Sajjan Kumar now stands convicted for conspiracy to murder and for the abetment of murder, in the deaths of Kehar Singh and his 18-year-old son Gurpreet Singh, and the killings of Raghuvinder Singh, Narender Pal Singh, and Kuldeep Singh — all members of the same family. I mention the names of the dead because the dead in communal violence should not lose their vestigial humanity by being simply reduced to a score of unnamed victims.Kehar Singh’s wife, Jagdish Kaur, was one of the principal witnesses against Sajjan Kumar. The other principal witness is her cousin Jagsher Singh, whose brothers Raghuvinder and Narender Pal Singh were also killed on November 1, 1984. The high court judgment notes Jagdish Kaur’s recollection: “At around 9 am on 2nd November 1984, when she went to lodge a report at the PP, she saw that a public meeting was taking place which was attended by A-1 who was the local Member of Parliament (MP). She heard him declare, “Sikhsala ek nahin bachna chahiye,joHindubhai unko sharan deta hai, uska ghar bhi jala do aur unko bhi maro.”The judgment records Jagsher Singh’s recollection that “around 10 p.m., he saw an Ambassador car which stopped at the turning onto Shiv Mandir Marg. He stated that 30-40 persons gathered around the car from which emerged A-1 who enquired as to whether ‘they have done the work’. Thereafter, it is stated, A-1 approached the house of PW-6 (Jagsher Singh) to inspect it and came back and told the assembled mob that they had ‘only broken the gate of the thekedars’ house’. One of the members of the mob then allegedly informed him that ‘the thekedars are being saved by the Hindus only’. Upon hearing this, A-1 is stated to have instructed the mob to burn the houses of the Hindus who were sheltering the Sikhs. He then left in his car.”The court rules: “To this Court, PW-1 [Jagdish Kaur] comes across as a fearless and truthful witness. Till she was absolutely certain that her making statements will serve a purpose, she did not come forward to do so. This is understandable given the fact that all previous attempts at securing justice for the victims had failed. The large number of acquittals in the cases demonstrated how the investigation was completely botched-up. It also demonstrated the power and influence of the accused and how witnesses could easily be won over. The atmosphere of distrust created as a result of these developments would have dissuaded the victims from coming forward to speak about what they knew. In the context of these cases, the factum of delay cannot be used to the advantage of the accused but would, in fact, explain the minor contradictions and inconsistencies in the statements of the key eye-witnesses in the present case. Nothing in the deposition of PW-1 points to either untruthfulness or unreliability. Her evidence deserves acceptance.”A moment of reflectionSajjan Kumar is not very different from many other politicians of this era, who use mob emotions to ride to power. However, he is probably the first to be held guilty of conspiring with the mob to cause the deaths of his constituents. It is for us as a country to ensure that mob violence yields no political dividends. If we as voters decide to electorally punish those who incite mobs, yield to them, or fail to stop their violence, the resort to politics of mass murders will simply stop. The judgment notes that “there has been a familiar pattern of mass killings in Mumbai in 1993, in Gujarat in 2002, in Kandhamal, Odisha in 2008, in Muzaffarnagar in U.P. in 2013 to name a few. Common to these mass crimes were the targeting of minorities and the attacks spearheaded by the dominant political actors being facilitated by the law enforcement agencies. The criminals responsible for the mass crimes have enjoyed political patronage and managed to evade prosecution and punishment.”It also says: “While it is undeniable that it has taken over three decades to bring the accused in this case to justice, and that our criminal justice system stands severely tested in that process, it is essential, in a democracy governed by the rule of law to be able to call out those responsible for such mass crimes. It is important to assure those countless victims waiting patiently that despite the challenges, truth will prevail and justice will be done.”While the 1984, 1993, 2002, 2008 and 2013 riots are painful episodes in our history, the judgments of the Delhi High Court of 2018 in the Sajjan Kumar and Hashimpura cases shine like good deeds in a naughty world. Milan Kundera wrote that “the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting”. The judgment tells Kehar Singh, Gurpreet Singh, Raghuvinder Singh, Narender Pal Singh and Kuldeep Singh, that neither Jagdish Kaur nor India have as yet forgotten them.Sanjay Hegde is a senior advocate of the Supreme Court"

Benefit of the doubt must go to accused: Supreme Court

Court says this should apply irrespective of the gravity of the crime in case if a flawed investigation ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The benefit of the doubt in cases based on a flawed police investigation must favour the accused irrespective of the gravity of the crime, the Supreme Court held in a recent judgment in a 17-year-old case of murder and rioting in Uttar Pradesh.“The accused cannot be expected to relinquish his innocence at the hands of an inefficacious prosecution, which is ridden with investigative deficiencies,” a Bench of Justices N.V. Ramana and Mohan M. Shantanagoudar observed in a verdict pronounced on December 10. “The benefit of doubt arising out of such inefficient investigation, must be bestowed upon the accused,” the court ruled.“The cumulative effect of investigative lapses fortifies the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused,” Justice Ramana wrote for the Bench, dismissing the appeal of the Uttar Pradesh government against the acquittal of Wasif Haider and others. In 2001, a mob of 200-300 unidentified persons had gone on a rampage in Kanpur’s Chaubey Gola temple area, with the rioters opening fire at police personnel killing a senior officer and injuring another.Produced in a test identification parade, the accused were arrested on the basis of witnesses testimony. While the Kanpur trial court held the accused to be guilty in 2004, the High Court acquitted them citing contradictions in the testimonies of the witnesses.When the State appealed in the Supreme Court, Kamini Jaiswal and Siddhartha Dave, appearing for the accused, argued that the witnesses were at a great distance from the place of occurrence and it was not plausible to identify the accused.The court agreed that the case “is ridden with multiple investigative lapses and flaws, which goes to the root of the matter”."

Rajya Sabha disrupted for fifth day over Rafale, Cauvery ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-disrupted-for-fifth-day-over-rafale-cauvery/article25771936.ece,,,"Rajya Sabha could not function for fifth consecutive day of Winter Session as the House was adjourned after heated exchanges between the BJP and Congress members on Rafale deal while the AIADMK and DMK protested over Cauvery issue.As the House met Tuesday morning, Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu informed the members that various notices on urgent matters, ranging from cyclones affecting lives in some states to price rise to agriculture crisis, have been admitted for discussion.Mr. Naidu, who had adjourned the proceedings for the entire day on Monday amid uproar over Rafale, Cauvery and other issues, appealed to the members to let the House run its business.The Chairman said that he was going through a privilege notice given by the Opposition.However, soon after the papers were laid by the ministers, members from the two major political parties of Tamil Nadu — AIADMK and DMK — trooped into the Well of the House, carrying placards and shouting slogans against construction of a dam on Cauvery river.Some members from Andhra Pradesh were also seen displaying placards demanding special status for the state.Amid sloganeering, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the privilege motion against the government on the Rafale jet deal should be accepted as the matter is agitating the minds of the people.Mr. Azad alleged the government has misled Parliament and the Supreme Court on the issue, triggering vociferous protests from the treasury benches. The senior Congress leader said the government has no right to continue in office and “should go.”Mr. Naidu, however, said that the Chair should be allowed to take a view on the privilege notice.The Congress had given the notice demanding an explanation from the government on why it provided the Supreme Court “wrong” information on the purchase of Rafale fighter jet from a French company.Countering Mr. Azad, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel said the government was ready to discuss all issues, including Rafale. He demanded that the Congress apologise in the wake of the apex court’s refusal to order an SIT probe in Rafale deal and Sajjan Kumar’s conviction by the Delhi High Court in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.As slogan shouting by the AIADMK and DMK members continued in the Well of the House, Mr. Naidu adjourned the House till 2 pm.When the House resumed in the afternoon again, Mr. Naidu proposed to discuss a calling attention of the Minister of Home Affairs on the situation arising due to devastation caused by cyclones Gaja and Titli in some states and the action taken by the government in this regard.However, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma raised a point of order saying that Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs had referred to Rahul Gandhi and it is against the rule to demand his apology because he is member of other House.Soon after, the ruling party member again started raising slogans and demanded apology from Mr. Gandhi while some of the AIADMK and DMK members trooped into the well to protest over Cauvery issue.Mr. Naidu said that there is no point of order in the matter and asked the member to discuss the serious issues mainly related farmers which are a problem not only in Tamil Naidu but across the country.Rajya Sabha proceedings have been disrupted since the session started last week on issues like Rafale, dam on Cauvery river and demand for special status to Andhra Pradesh."

We were not scared of thieves, forget about worrying about someone coming in to kill a person,” he said.Another resident of the colony, Rakesh Kumar, who was present during the riots in 1984, said: “There are not many families left in Raj Nagar that had witnessed the riots as the colony has grown so much and most of the residents are new. I know of many families that left Delhi and went to Punjab after the riots, but there was no exodus as such. It has always been peaceful.”For most of the residents of the area, it was life as usual with very few even aware that it was in their colony that five persons were killed and a Congress leader had been convicted for it."

Sajjan Kumar’s conviction reignites hope of substantial justice for riot victims ",,"Five years ago, there wasn’t even a sliver of hope that any influential Congress leader would be brought to justice for the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984. A trial court had acquitted former MP Sajjan Kumar, rejecting the testimony of witnesses who said he was seen instigating riots in the Raj Nagar area of Delhi Cantonment on November 1, 1984, in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi’s assassination. In reversing the acquittal and sentencing Kumar to imprisonment for the remainder of his life, the Delhi High Court has reignited hope for substantial justice. The 207-page judgment by a Division Bench, comprising Justice S. Muralidhar and Justice Vinod Goel, is proof, if any were needed, that the Delhi Police and its Riot Cell had failed to carry out a genuine investigation. From the deliberate failure to record any untoward incident in the station’s daily register to avoiding the examination of key witnesses, there is a long trail of evidence that points a damning finger at the police and the state machinery.

Her deposition was sought to be impeached on the ground that she had not named Sajjan Kumar before the Ranganath Misra Commission. As it turned out, she may actually have done so, in Punjabi; the English version of her statement did not have it. In addition, the court found that Kumar had been named in nearly a dozen affidavits in 1985 itself, but none had been investigated. In one case, a prepared charge sheet had not been filed in court. Such was his influence that in 1990 when the CBI went to arrest him, the officers were held hostage until an anticipatory bail order was obtained, even as their vehicles were burnt by his supporters outside his house. The 73-year-old former strongman may now pin his hopes on an appeal to the Supreme Court, but there is little doubt that judicial decisions such as this reinforce the hope that political patronage, administrative complicity and plain muscle power cannot prevail over the truth all the time. The court has also flagged the need for a separate law for punishment for crimes against humanity and genocide, both seen so far as part of international law but rarely invoked in domestic crimes. Given the major communal flashpoints in recent history that have been cited by the court, the issue is worth positive consideration."

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Demanding that its recognition as a political party be scrapped for both “leading and protecting” the perpetrators of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the BJP on Monday welcomed the conviction of Sajjan Kumar and attacked the Congress.Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, at a press conference, also questioned Congress national president Rahul Gandhi’s decision to elevate senior party hand Kamal Nath, also an accused in a case related to the riots, to the Chief Minister’s chair in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP also staged a protest near the Congress headquarters against Mr. Nath, where his effigy was burnt.“Though there has been a delay, the judiciary has once again proved that nobody is above the law of the land. Today’s judgment proves that and the party, while welcoming the decision, hopes that the other accused in the case, including senior leaders of the Congress, will also be awarded stern punishment so that the victims of the massacre are able to renew their faith in the system,” Mr. Tiwari said.“The Congress president talks about morality in politics but he has himself selected Mr. Nath, who is also an accused in the case, to be the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh... The Congress and its leaders have not only committed crimes against the Sikhs, but also against the country. The recognition of the Congress party, which has given protection to these criminals should be cancelled,” Mr. Tiwari said further.The North-East Delhi MP, arguing that 2,733 Sikhs were brutally murdered in Delhi and 3,350 Sikhs were “killed by Congress leaders in the entire country”, said the party still “fielded them in the elections and offered them high posts” that was “sufficient to prove” extent to which the Congress was “ready to save the people who committed crime against the Sikhs”.The party’s national general secretary Sardar R.P. Singh alleged that Mr. Gandhi, by appointing Mr. Nath who had “provoked a mob assembled at Rakabganj Gurdwara” as the Chief Minister, had added “insult to the injury of Sikhs for which the community will not forgive him”.Meanwhile, protesters, including members from families targeted during the riots attempted to march from the Taj Mansingh Hotel towards the Congress headquarters on Akbar Road, but were stopped en route by the police.“There are witnesses against Mr. Nath who led the mob during the anti-Sikh riots. Still Mr. Gandhi chose to make him the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, thereby opening the old wounds of the victims and their families,” alleged Delhi BJP vice-president Rajeev Babbar, who led the protest.Delhi Congress has refused to comment on the issue."

The Congress just tried to play politics over a sensitive issue of procurement in a defence deal, he said.A person involved in anti-Sikh riots has been made the Madhya Pradesh Chief MinisterSambit Patra,BJP spokesman"

We were not scared of thieves, forget about worrying about someone coming in to kill a person,” he said.Another resident of the colony, Rakesh Kumar, who was present during the riots in 1984, said: “There are not many families left in Raj Nagar that had witnessed the riots as the colony has grown so much and most of the residents are new. I know of many families that left Delhi and went to Punjab after the riots, but there was no exodus as such. It has always been peaceful.”For most of the residents of the area, it was life as usual with very few even aware that it was in their colony that five persons were killed and a Congress leader had been convicted for it.There are not many families left in Raj Nagar that witnessed the riots as the colony has grown so much and most of the residents are new.

The BJP also staged a protest near the Congress headquarters against Mr. Nath, where his effigy was burnt.“Though there has been a delay, the judiciary has once again proved that nobody is above the law of the land. Today’s judgment proves that and the party, while welcoming the decision, hopes that the other accused in the case, including senior leaders of the Congress, will also be awarded stern punishment so that the victims of the massacre are able to renew their faith in the system,” Mr. Tiwari said.“The Congress president talks about morality in politics but he has himself selected Mr. Nath, who is also an accused in the case, to be the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh... The Congress and its leaders have not only committed crimes against the Sikhs, but also against the country. The recognition of the Congress party, which has given protection to these criminals should be cancelled,” Mr. Tiwari said further.The North-East Delhi MP, arguing that 2,733 Sikhs were brutally murdered in Delhi and 3,350 Sikhs were “killed by Congress leaders in the entire country”, said the party still “fielded them in the elections and offered them high posts” that was “sufficient to prove” extent to which the Congress was “ready to save the people who committed crime against the Sikhs”.The party’s national general secretary Sardar R.P. Singh alleged that Mr. Gandhi, by appointing Mr. Nath who had “provoked a mob assembled at Rakabganj Gurdwara” as the Chief Minister, had added “insult to the injury of Sikhs for which the community will not forgive him”.Meanwhile, protesters, including members from families targeted during the riots attempted to march from the Taj Mansingh Hotel towards the Congress headquarters on Akbar Road, but were stopped en route by the police.“There are witnesses against Mr. Nath who led the mob during the anti-Sikh riots. Still Mr. Gandhi chose to make him the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, thereby opening the old wounds of the victims and their families,” alleged Delhi BJP vice-president Rajeev Babbar, who led the protest.Delhi Congress has refused to comment on the issue.There are witnesses against Kamal Nath, who led the mob during the anti-Sikh riots.

The Delhi High Court on Monday sentenced Sajjan Kumar to life imprisonment for criminal conspiracy to commit murder. The MSA in a statement said it was hopeful that other culprits in the case would also be awarded punishment soon.MSA convener Bal Malkit Singh said the association had several times submitted memorandums to top leaders and dignitaries, demanding justice in the case.‘Awaiting justice’“We hail the justice granted to the Sikh community, although delayed by 34 years. The painful stories that we heard bring to fore the ugly memories and pain of untold dimensions. We hope that all the criminals will be sentenced soon,” Mr. Singh said in the statement.In February this year, the MSA had held a protest at Azad Maidan in Mumbai to demand justice for the victims. The riots, in which thousands of Sikhs were killed, broke out after the assassination of prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984. The Delhi High Court said Mr. Kumar’s life imprisonment will be for the rest of his life and asked him to surrender by December 31. The court also asked him not to leave Delhi before that."

Weary relief in ‘Tilak Vihar Widow Colony’ after HC convicts Sajjan Kumar ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/weary-relief-in-tilak-vihar-widow-colony-after-hc-convicts-sajjan-kumar/article25764887.ece,"
The memories were back, as intense as they were in the immediate aftermath of what is one of the worst riots in post independent India.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Tragedy has been the calling card of the ‘Tilak Vihar Widow Colony’ for 34 years but on Monday the many grim stories were edged faintly with what could pass off as happiness --Congress leader Sajjan Kumar was convictedfor his role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.The colony, set up to house the families of those killed in the violence that followed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination on October 31, 1984, was back in the news with the Delhi High Court convicting the leader and sentencing him for life.Long used to journalists queuing up outside the confining streets of the colony near west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar locality every anniversary of the assassination and the violence that claimed nearly 3,000 lives over three days, the people of Tilak Vihar wearily recounted their stories and their wait for justice. The story turned a page for them on Monday.“Main khush haan iss verdict toh (I am happy with this verdict),” said Popri Kaur in Punjabi, weeping inconsolably, for her husband who was pulled out from their home in Sultanpuri by a mob armed with sticks 34 years ago and for the fact that justice was finally being done.The memories were back, as intense as they were in the immediate aftermath of what is one of the worst riots in post independent India. “It was the last time my children saw their father, and the last time I saw my husband,” said the 65-year-old, adding that she never even got the satisfaction of seeing his body.The mother of six is one of the three witnesses in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases involving senior Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, who is the most high profile leaders to be convicted. She alleged that she was offered money and received death threats to change her statement.“Sajjan Kumar was in the car when my husband was dragged out of our house in Sultanpuri. I saw him. Today, I was sitting in my house when my daughter called and said, ‘Sajjan Kumar has been convicted’,” Popri Kaur said.Her sobs hang heavy in the air over the colony, which has 944 flats. Like many other refugee colonies, it tells its story of despair -- peeling paint, crumbling plaster, unlit rooms, dingy staircases. Unable to move past its name, the ‘widow colony’ has for the longest time been the sitting story for justice ‘not delivered’. Though happy with the high court verdict, Popri Kaur said she wanted capital punishment for Sajjan Kumar.“With life imprisonment, he can meet his family, his children. I can’t meet my husband, my children can’t meet their father because he killed them,” she said. As the media crowded around the block of flats, senior BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga was sitting on an indefinite hunger strike not far from Popri Kaur’s one room tenement against Congress leader Kamal Nath being named chief minister of Madhya Pradesh.According to Bagga, Nath is culpable in the violence. He alleged that Nath “murdered Sikhs” and “burnt Gurdwara Rakab Ganj“. Nath has maintained that he played no role in the violence and that there are no charges against him. But Amarjeet Singh was not going to let Nath spoil the day.Sitting on a folded bed, busy reading today’s newspaper, Amarjeet Singh said he is not bothered about Nath and wished only to read Tuesday’s headlines. “Son, you don’t know how long I have waited to read the story that is going to make to the front page tomorrow,” he said with a smile.Amarjeet Singh, 63, lost his brother in the riots. His only problem with the verdict, he said, is that the court gave Sajjan Kumar “15 days” to surrender. “Why give him that much time. He should be behind bars immediately,” he said. The high court directed 73-year-old Kumar and other five convicts to surrender by December 31, 2018 and not to leave the city of Delhi.The bench of justices S. Muralidhar and Vinod Goel convicted the Congress leader for offences of criminal conspiracy and abetment in commission of crimes of murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony and defiling and destruction of a Gurdwara. Popri Kaur echoed Amarjeet Singh and said Kumar should surrender immediately.“He might flee or bribe the system and go scot free yet again,” she said as her 40-year-old son interjected, trying to make her understand why this was not possible. “Not possible? What else has happened in the past 34 years?” she chided him, looking at the garlanded photo of her husband atop a TV screen running news of the conviction with Kumar’s photograph."

Kumar, who has been convicted for criminal conspiracy, promoting enmity and acts against communal harmony, by the Delhi High Court, was earlier acquitted by the trial court.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Thirty-four years after the mass killing of Sikhs in the aftermath of the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Delhi High Court on Monday convicted Congress leader Sajjan Kumar for the murder of five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar area here and sent him to imprisonment for the rest of his natural life.It termed the killing of nearly 3,350 Sikhs between November 1-4, 1984, in Delhi and the rest of the country, as “crimes against humanity,” which were “engineered by political actors with the assistance of the law enforcement agencies.”A Bench of Justices S. Muralidhar and Vinod Goel overturned the April 2013 judgment of a trial court that acquitted Mr. Kumar. It said he was the leader of the mob and abetted the commission of crimes by his repeated exhortations. It asked him to surrender by December 31. “What happened in the aftermath of the assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi was a carnage of unbelievable proportions, in which over 2,700 Sikhs were murdered in Delhi alone,” it said. As Justice Muralidhar recalled the atrocities, relatives of the victims broke down.HC lauds courage of witnessesThe Delhi High Court relied mainly on the deposition of three witnesses, Jagdish Kaur, Jagsher Singh, and Nirpreet Kaur, noting that the accused in this case have been brought to justice primarily on account of their courage and perseverance.Jagdish Kaur’s husband, son and three cousins were the five killed. Jagsher Singh was another cousin of Jagdish Kaur, and Nirpreet Kaur saw the gurdwara being burnt down and her father being burnt alive by the raging mob.“It is only after the CBI entered the scene, that they were able to speak up. Admirably, they stuck firm to the truth at the trial,” the High Court said.It also upheld the conviction and varying punishment given to former Congress councillor Balwan Khokar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and former MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar by the trial court.The Bench found it strange that while the trial court disbelieved the deposition of Nirpreet Kaur while acquitting Mr. Kumar, the same court relied on it to convict the other accused."

French ‘yellow vests’ protest in their thousands for fifth Saturday

Police fired water cannon and teargas in the afternoon to disperse groups of protesters in sporadic, brief clashes with riot police on the Champs-Elysees and adjacent streets.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Thousands of protesters took to the streets of French cities on Saturday in the fifth weekend of demonstrations against Emmanuel Macron's government, ignoring calls to hold off after a gun attack in Strasbourg this week.In Paris, police were out in force to contain outbursts of violence. But the demonstrations were noticeably smaller than in previous weeks, possibly a response to the Strasbourg attack or to the cold, rainy weather.Police fired water cannon and teargas in the afternoon to disperse groups of protesters in sporadic, brief clashes with riot police on the Champs-Elysees and adjacent streets.Topless feminist activists braved the cold to face off with security forces, a few metres away from the Elysee Palace, the president's residence.And French media showed footage of clashes between police and protesters in Nantes, western France, and further south in Bordeaux and Toulouse.The 'yellow vest' movement started in mid-November with protests at junctions and roundabouts against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilisation against Macron's economic policies.Successive weekends of protests in Paris have lead to vandalism and violent clashes with security forces. Despite the protests, several major stores, such as the Galeries Lafayette, opened to lure in Christmas shoppers.Loic Bollay (44), marching on the Champs-Elysees in a yellow vest, said the protests were more subdued but the movement would go on until the demonstrators' grievances were addressed.“Since the Strasbourg attack, it is calmer, but I think next Saturday and the following Saturdays...it will come back.”The Interior Minister said around 69,000 police were active on Saturday with a reinforced presence in Toulouse, Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne.Official figures said 66,000 protesters had been counted in France by 1700 GMT, compared to 126,000 at the same time a week before.In Paris, some 4,000 protesters marched in splintered groups in several neighbourhoods, and at least 168 were arrested, a Paris police official said.On Friday, President Macron called for a return to calm in France after nearly a month of protests by the so-called 'yellow vest' movement against his government's policies. The demonstrations have hit growth and caused widespread disruption.“France needs calm, order and a return to normal,” Mr. Macron said, after a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels.In a televised address on Monday, Mr. Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners in further concessions meant to end the movement, but many said they would maintain pressure.The government, as well as several unions and opposition politicians had called on protesters to stay off the streets, after four people were killed in a gun attack at a Christmas market in the historic city of Strasbourg."

Is the Aatash really that fragile, asks a thinking Parsi
",,"Parsis (I’m one, too) can sometimes be a confusing lot, especially when it comes to understanding one another’s sentiments within the community.The intense battle currently being fought within the Parsi community in and around Mumbai over the tunneling work being carried out by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) for Metro 3, which is slated to pass under the Wadiaji Aatash Behram and the Anjuman Aatash Behram at Princess Street junction, proves this. This mud-slinging between the citizens, senior priests, ervads (priests) and fire temple trustees, combined with a pinch or two of advocates and civil engineers, really had me baffled about the Holy Aatash.I am not a tunneling engineer, nor an advocate, and not a Dasturji (priest). I am a Zoroastrian, and the vastly contrasting views of eminent scholars and know-alls in our community have left me with an increasingly puzzling conundrum.The MMRCL tunneling machines are boring their way towards the two Aatash Behrams, but the work has now been put on hold following a petition filed in the Bombay High Court, where a judgment was issued on November 30, 2018 stating that the High Court does not “find it appropriate to withhold the infrastructure project of this magnitude any further.” An appeal filed in the Supreme Court was rejected and the MMRCL has been given the go-ahead for the work.The petitioners stated that, “if a tunnel for the metro is allowed to be bored under the premises of the above Aatash Behrams, the spiritual circuits will be breached and negative forces of physical and spiritual will attack the holy fire, thus diminishing its spiritual prowess.”In contrast, the respondents stated that one cannot “establish the fact that if the tunnel is allowed to pass beneath the premises of the Aatash Behrams, an essential and integral part of the Zoroastrian faith would be defeated.”I didn’t know what to believe. So I turned to my faith and asked myself one question. Is our Aatash really that fragile?The Aatash, or the holy flame of Zoroastrians, is an eternal flame. Growing up, I was taught that it represents the spirit within all of us, makes us mighty, is a symbol of timeless purity and gives us something to pray to — a visible signature of Ahura Mazda, the God of the Zoroastrians.This Aatash burning in our Aatash Dadgahs, Aatash Adarans and Aatash Behrams has survived the harshest of forces over centuries of the community’s existence. It survived the fall of the Sassanid Empire after the conquest of Persia and persecution by the conquerors. Then, after enduring a gruelling and torturous voyage by sea and land from Iran, it landed in Sanjan around 1,300-odd years ago.On arrival in India, the Aatash was taken back and forth between various places in Gujarat, before being established at Udvada. Its descendants have been housed at several Agiaries, Dadgahs and Aatash Behrams all over India. These Aatashs have survived the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni, the wars of Alauddin Khalji, the Battle of Diu against the Portuguese, exploitation by the East India Company, the India-Pakistan war, floods, cyclones, earthquakes, communal riots, terrorist attacks, bomb explosions, droughts, pollution, traffic, communal differences and much more.If the Aatash has survived all this, I am convinced that a metro tunnel with a passenger-filled train passing under the sanctum sanctorum will never ever “result in complete desecration” of the Aatash. Add to this the basic maxims of the Zoroastrian religion, which encourages thinking good thoughts, speaking good words, doing good deeds and a spirituality that will remain eternal with Good conquering Evil.Anyone who thinks otherwise just may have tunnel vision!zahirabwadia@gmail.com"

Police said they would put up the posters at public places in Bulandshahr, assuring locals who provide information that their identify will be kept secret.Superintendent of Police Bulandshahr City, Atul Srivastava, said the photographs were released on the basis of CCTV footage and video clips. “And those who were not identified, we have released their photos and asked people to identify them and inform us,” said the officer.स्याना हिंसा में फरार बलवायों की चल संपत्ति होगी कुर्क,#bulandshahrpolने जारी किए उपद्रवियों के फ़ोटो! सूचना देने वाले का नाम गोपनीय रखा जायेगा।@Uppolice@adgzonemeerut@News18UP@ANINewsUPpic.twitter.com/g81j1NANln— Bulandshahr Police (@bulandshahrpol)December 14, 2018Under pressure to nab the culprits, the police have also initiated steps to attach the property of the accused and stuck notices outside their homes.The action comes after non-bailable warrants were issued against 27 absconding accused on Wednesday. In their application, the investigators argued that the accused though on the run were “trying to disrupt communal harmony by making videos of the incident viral and attempting to influence evidence.”TV interviewWhile both Yogesh Raj and Shikhar Agarwal released video messages soon after being named in the FIR, Agarwal also appeared on a Hindi television channel in a full-fledged interview as recent as December 9, embarrassing the police.“We are trying to find the link of the videos,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Raghvendra Mishra.The police also had to face embarrassment after they released a wrong photo for one of the accused, Vishal Tyagi. The officer toldThe Hinduthat while there was an accused by the name, the photograph published was of somebody else. “We are correcting it,” he said.17 held so farThe police have so far arrested 17 persons in the case. Saurabh Payal, a 26-year-old resident of Khad Mohanagar village, was picked up by a team of the Special Task Force near Bugrasi Road in Bulandshahr on Wednesday. On Saturday, four more accused — Amit Singh Jat, Ashish Kumar, Hemu Singh Gurjar and Ankur Jat — were arrested.The arrested also include Jeetu Fauji or Jitendra Malik, an Army jawan who emerged as a key suspect in the murder of officer Subodh Singh. Jeetu Fauji is currently under judicial custody.When Senior Superintendent of Police Bulandshahr Prabhakar Chaudhary was asked why the remaining accused were yet to be nabbed, he said legal proceedings were on. “If they were here, we would have arrested them. They are absconding,” he said.More than 70 persons, with some of them allegedly having links to the VHP and its youth wing Bajrang Dal, were booked on charges of murder, attempt to murder, rioting, sedition, damage to public property and dacoity, among others in the mob violence case which took place after allegations of cow slaughter in a village in Bulandshahr on December 3."

At least 322 people have been killed and more than 500 are incarcerated, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, one of the groups that the government has blacklisted.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Nicaraguan police on Saturday beat at least seven journalists with batons, including one of the country's best known editors, in an escalating crackdown on independent media in the aftermath of protests against President Daniel Ortega.Earlier this week police occupied the offices of prominent editor Carlos Fernando Chamorro, along with buildings used by several civil society organizations it had banned.Journalists on Saturday gathered outside the police headquarters in the capital Managua. Mr. Chamorro asked officers outside for information about what he called the illegal raid on his offices, in which officers confiscated equipment and papers.After his request, policemen in anti-riot gear emerged from the headquarters swinging batons at and kicking Mr. Chamorro, his colleagues and reporters who were at the scene to cover the event.A Reuters witness counted at least seven journalists from international and national media, including Mr. Chamorro, who were grabbed and kicked by the police.The police chased the journalists, with some calling them “coup plotters” and threatening to confiscate cell phones and equipment.“Three officers beat me,” said Nşstor Arce, a journalist at Chamorro's Confidencial weekly. “They kicked me in the leg trying to knock me down.”Since April, Nicaragua has been experiencing one of its worst crises since a civil war in the 1980s. Protests raged for months before a government clampdown reined them in.At least 322 people have been killed and more than 500 are incarcerated, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, one of the groups that the government has blacklisted.Ana Maria Tello, who works with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights' (IACHR) in Nicaragua, expressed concern at the “increase in repression against NGOs and independent media and journalists.”The Ortega government did not respond to a request for comment about Saturday's violence. Ortega has called the protests an attempt at a “coup d'ştat”."

War of words in Punjab Assembly

SAD protests nomination of Kamal Nath as M.P. CM, says he was involved in anti-Sikh riots
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Heated words were exchanged in the Punjab Assembly on Friday between the treasury benches and the opposition Shiromani Akali Dal members as the issue of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots took center stage, after Congress party’s Kamal Nath was named as Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister.Shiromani Akali Dal MLA’s shouted slogans against the Congress party for deciding to nominate Mr. Nath as Chief Minister. SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia alleged that Mr. Nath was involved in the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.‘Promoting perpetrators’SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, later talking to reporters, said: “The Congress party led by the ‘Gandhi family’ was also promoting the perpetrators of the 1984 Sikh riots as per its old policy by deciding to nominate Kamal Nath to the post of Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh.”Intervening during a call attention motion on the issue, after it was raised by the Akali Dal, Capt. Amarinder Singh said the law was taking its due course as far as allegations against Mr. Nath were concerned.“The fact of the matter was that Kamal Nath had been a Central minister for more than 10 years after the allegations first surfaced, a mere reference about the senior Congress leader in the Nanavati Commission report could not be construed as his involvement in the case. The law alone could decide the role of any individual,” the Chief Minister said, adding that nobody should exploit this sensitive issue of the 1984 riots for their political ends.The State Assembly passed a unanimous resolution by voice vote on the opening of “Dera Baba Nanak-Kartarpur Sahib Corridor”. Presenting the resolution in the House, Capt. Amarinder described the corridor as a ‘Bridge of Peace’ between the people of India and Pakistan and said that “...the House records its appreciation for the efforts made by the Punjab Government and the Government of India to open the corridor”.On a suggestion given by Sukhbir Badal, the resolution also added for swapping of Punjab’s land with Pakistan to bring the Kartarpur gurdwara within Indian territory.Capt. Amarinder said he was subjected to a lot of criticism from different quarters, including SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal and president Sukhbir Singh Badal, for his unequivocal stand on the Pakistan Army’s persistent efforts to revive militancy in Punjab. Capt. Amarinder said: “Do you really think that Pakistan Army is our sympathiser, when it is continuously killing our soldiers at the border with the aim of destabilising the State.”Pakistan ArmyCapt. Amarinder called upon all political parties to be wary of the Pakistan Army’s ulterior motive to revive terrorism in Punjab through ISI-backed stooges, which was evident from the fact that several terrorist modules had been neutralised and from the arrest of numerous operatives, besides seizure of large hauls of ammunition and narcotics."

The administration in Gujarat did not seem interested in ending the 2002 riots, says a retired Lieutenant General
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Lieutenant General Zameer Uddin Shah retired as Deputy Chief of Army Staff in 2008. His autobiography,The Sarkari Mussalman, stands out particularly for the frank account of his role as commanding officer of the troops that quelled the Gujarat riots in 2002 and his ruminations about his tenure as vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).General Shah squarely lays the blame for the Gujarat killings on the State government. The civilian authorities did not act in time to stop the massacres. In fact, by permitting the open display of the bodies of kar sevaks killed in the Godhra train fire, the State government became complicit in inciting the rioters. General Shah asserts that on multiple occasions he witnessed the police standing idle as mobs attacked Muslims and set fire to their property. On some occasions the police fired into Muslim houses instead of on the mobs, he says, on the pretext that they were trying to separate the rioters belonging to the two communities.His indictment of the civilian authorities is borne out by the fact that although the forces under his command numbering 3,000 reached Ahmedabad airport on March 1 morning, the Gujarat government failed to provide them with transport and the logistical support necessary for deployment to the riot-affected areas. General Shah drove to the Chief Minister’s residence at 2 a.m. that day to ask for assistance but nothing was done for a whole day. The troops could not be deployed until the next day and consequently, innumerable lives that could have been saved were lost. General Shah praises the impartial and professional way the forces under his command acted to bring the killings to an end. He affirms that without their deployment the riots would not have been brought under control as the police and the politicians did not seem interested in ending the mayhem.General Shah’s account of his time as the vice chancellor of AMU sounds quite depressing even though it has some bright spots such as the university being ranked the best in the country by Times Higher Education during his tenure. The malaise from which AMU suffers is not unique. Almost all universities in the country face the same problems, especially political interference and the consequent erosion of institutional autonomy. Aligarh’s travails hit the headlines more often because the term “Muslim” is included in its appellation. This also seems to be the reason why the former Human Resource Development Minister in the National Democratic Alliance government treated General Shah with unwarranted disrespect as he recounts with anguish.General Shah deserves to be commended for not pulling his punches. This distinguishes his memoir from others of this genre.The writer is University Distinguished Professor Emeritus of International Relations, Michigan State University"

Police were reported to have rounded up a large number of “suspects” in major cities throughout East Pakistan where the strike call appeared to have been obeyed by the majority of workers. One of the men arrested in Dacca was Colonel Mukhtar Husain, Private Secretary to Independent Opposition leader Air Marshal Asghar Khan.

Five arrested on charge of murder attempt

Alleged stabbing of a youngster following a clash
",,"The Palarivattom police have arrested five youngsters on the charge of attempt to murder in connection with an incident in which a youngster was allegedly stabbed following a clash between two groups on Powerhouse Road near North Janatha on Sunday night.The arrested are Minhaj, 19, Aswin, 18, and Jamsheer, 19, all residents of Karukappally; Ashik, 20, of Pathadipalam, and Vivek, 20, of Elamakkara. A hunt is on for seven more accused. The arrested were produced in court and remanded.A 12-member gang and another group of 10 members, including the victim, had clashed. The attackers reportedly fled the scene on the arrival of the police who, however, managed to chase down two of them. Their two-wheelers were also seized, while three others were taken into custody on Tuesday.“There had been tension and a clash of egos between the two groups in the past, and a silly dispute after one group member was stopped by the other group recently led to the violent incident. Some of the accused are known troublemakers, and stringent action was taken to ensure that they didn’t turn hardened criminals,” said S. Sanal, Station House Officer, Palarivattom.The group was allegedly involved in an attack on a hostel in the city a few months ago. Two were taken into custody and remanded in that case. But the First Investigation Report had to be quashed after the accused managed to cajole the complainant into withdrawing the petition.The police have registered a case invoking IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder) 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), and 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object)."

When the phone buzzes at odd hours, you know it’s Trump ",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/when-the-phone-buzzes-at-odd-hours-you-know-its-trump/article25711913.ece,"
On the tweeting President who makes the very existence of journalists irrelevant
",,"I don’t tweet much. And not using Twitter today is probably equivalent to a reporter not learning shorthand a few decades ago. You can get by, but only barely. If smart mining of the platform can yield useful inputs for your reporting in general, reporting on U.S. President Donald Trump is impossible without tracking his Twitter handle continuously. I learnt this as this newspaper’s former U.S. correspondent.That I was an early riser helped in this case, as Mr. Trump’s Twitter life starts pretty early in the day. I noticed that on most days his first post was some time between 6.30 and 7.00 a.m. in the initial days of his presidency. Soon I realised that he could tweet any time, and to deal with this, set up an instant alert on any posts from @realDonaldTrump. From the sacking of his Secretary of State to what he thinks of transgender soldiers, the world — and reporters — get to know the U.S President’s thoughts through Twitter regularly. Every time my phone buzzed, I knew that the President had something to say.But all this is not to make the life of journalists easy, but their very existence irrelevant. “I’m proud to announce to the media, to the American people and to the Indian people that Prime Minister Modi and I are world leaders in social media,” Mr. Trump said in his remarks in June 2017, at the White House, after his first bilateral meeting with Mr. Modi. “Giving the citizens of our countries the opportunity to hear directly from their elected officials and for us to hear directly from them. I guess it’s worked very well in both cases,” he said.Among things that we heard this week was his commentary on his former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson: “He was dumb as a rock… He was lazy as hell.” His take on the protests in Paris? “Protests and riots all over France…Chanting ‘We Want Trump!’ Love France.” American elites wake up to read such presidential transgressions everyday, and Mr. Trump gets his dose of pleasure.The policy implications of Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts are a mixed bag. Quite confident on January 1 morning this year that the U.S capital would be sleeping, I had not bothered about @realDonaldTrump. But if you can trust the President with one thing, it is to be unconventional. That early morning post was a rant against Pakistan. And when he tweets nothings, those become bigger stories. Remember “covfefe”? That word came in a tweet after midnight in May 2017. ""Who can figure out the true meaning of ‘covfefe’??? Enjoy!” he said six hours later.While Twitter has remained his principle tool of communication, a few times in the last 23 months Mr. Trump has also surprised scribes in the White House briefing room by suddenly appearing through the blue door behind the spokesperson’s podium, mostly to give some teasers on something that would happen later. Mr. Trump never runs away from the media. He is always willing to take an extra question, not necessarily to respond, but for a combative take down. But he wants Twitter to be a one-way street. Early this year, seven Twitter users blocked by him challenged him in court. The judge decided that the handle is a space operated by the government and ordered the President to unblock those handles. As for White House reporters, if you hear the buzz of your phone in the morning, you know who it is."

They threw stones and sticks at the police and wrenched shields and batons from the hands of the anti-riot police.The BJP fielded women workers in the front, who repeatedly tried to push their way through the police picket line. The police blocked the activists who retreated and staged a sit-in protest on the road. BJP national executive member Sobha Surendran, chanting Ayyappa incantations, led the demonstration. The BJP, incensed by Mr. Radhakrishnan’s failing health and the government’s refusal to engage the party in reconciliatory talks, had called for street protests across the State.Almost simultaneous marches taken out by the BJP in Kochi and Kottayam also resulted in minor scuffles with the police. The police said stones thrown by BJP workers from the rear of the demonstration had injured a woman activist who was in the forefront of the protest.Police officers injuredDistrict Police Chief P.

Following the stunning outburst, French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced a six-month reprieve from the hike, only to be rebuffed by the protesters as “too little, too late”.If in the days preceding the 70th anniversary of the UDHR, Paris saw scalding fire, Delhi saw a scorching ire.

",,"I don’t tweet much. And not using Twitter today is probably equivalent to a reporter not learning shorthand a few decades ago. You can get by, but only barely. If smart mining of the platform can yield useful inputs for your reporting in general, reporting on U.S. President Donald Trump is impossible without tracking his Twitter handle continuously. I learnt this as this newspaper’s former U.S. correspondent.That I was an early riser helped in this case, as Mr. Trump’s Twitter life starts pretty early in the day. I noticed that on most days his first post was some time between 6.30 and 7.00 a.m. in the initial days of his presidency. Soon I realised that he could tweet any time, and to deal with this, set up an instant alert on any posts from @realDonaldTrump. From the sacking of his Secretary of State to what he thinks of transgender soldiers, the world — and reporters — get to know the U.S President’s thoughts through Twitter regularly. Every time my phone buzzed, I knew that the President had something to say.But all this is not to make the life of journalists easy, but their very existence irrelevant. “I’m proud to announce to the media, to the American people and to the Indian people that Prime Minister Modi and I are world leaders in social media,” Mr. Trump said in his remarks in June 2017, at the White House, after his first bilateral meeting with Mr. Modi. “Giving the citizens of our countries the opportunity to hear directly from their elected officials and for us to hear directly from them. I guess it’s worked very well in both cases,” he said.Among things that we heard this week was his commentary on his former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson: “He was dumb as a rock… He was lazy as hell.” His take on the protests in Paris? “Protests and riots all over France…Chanting ‘We Want Trump!’ Love France.” American elites wake up to read such presidential transgressions everyday, and Mr. Trump gets his dose of pleasure.The policy implications of Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts are a mixed bag. Quite confident on January 1 morning this year that the U.S capital would be sleeping, I had not bothered about @realDonaldTrump. But if you can trust the President with one thing, it is to be unconventional. That early morning post was a rant against Pakistan. And when he tweets nothings, those become bigger stories. Remember “covfefe”? That word came in a tweet after midnight in May 2017. ""Who can figure out the true meaning of ‘covfefe’??? Enjoy!” he said six hours later.While Twitter has remained his principle tool of communication, a few times in the last 23 months Mr. Trump has also surprised scribes in the White House briefing room by suddenly appearing through the blue door behind the spokesperson’s podium, mostly to give some teasers on something that would happen later. Mr. Trump never runs away from the media. He is always willing to take an extra question, not necessarily to respond, but for a combative take down. But he wants Twitter to be a one-way street. Early this year, seven Twitter users blocked by him challenged him in court. The judge decided that the handle is a space operated by the government and ordered the President to unblock those handles. As for White House reporters, if you hear the buzz of your phone in the morning, you know who it is."

Delhi and Paris: A tale of two cities

Stirring reminders of the distance travelled and challenges ahead in securing human rights ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Paris flared — Paris, which the divine sun had sown with light, and where in glory waved the great future harvest of Truth and of Justice.Émile Zola, ParisI asked my soul: What is Delhi? She replied: The world is the body and Delhi its lifeMirza GhalibExactly 70 years ago, on December 10, 1948, the UN General Assembly met in Paris. Delegates from the world’s many ends met at the hilltop Palais de Chaillot and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The text had been propelled by Eleanor Roosevelt as chair of the drafting committee, and honed by some of the finest minds, scholars, legal and political idealists, visionaries. Selected by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to represent India in the drafting exercise, Hansa Mehta from Gujarat brought to the exercise her own distinctive feminism. Seeing the draft Article 1, “All men are born free and equal in dignity and rights,” Hansaben intervened to say the times had changed and the line should read, “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” Roosevelt applauded and embraced the amendment.Human beingsIn the post-Hitler, post-Hiroshima world that phrase meant more than any two could. The delegates to the Assembly nourished visions of a global transformation. But, given that of the 58 member-nations, as many as 10 including the Soviet Union, South Africa and Saudi Arabia abstained or did not vote, the delegates must have understood that a document as idealistic as theirs would run into conceptual difficulties and be chronically short in application.But they could not have imagined that on the Declaration’s 70th anniversary, Paris, the Declaration’s birthplace, would be the venue of a flaming stir, with cars burning along the Champs-Élysées, bringing life in the French capital to a stop. And that, as Emile Chabal has shown in these pages (Editorial page,The Hindu, December 6, 2018), provincial France and even France’s Indian Ocean island of La Réunion would see sit-ins, blockades. Over what? Not something sporadic or transient or ‘local’ but over issues at the heart of the Universal Declaration: dignity, justice and equality.The ‘Yellow Vest’ Paris riots which have shaken French President Emmanuel Macron’s government are about much more than fuel price hikes, the immediate trigger. Following the stunning outburst, French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced a six-month reprieve from the hike, only to be rebuffed by the protesters as “too little, too late”. Damien Abad, one of the youngest elected members of the European Parliament, said, “What we are asking of you Mr. Prime Minister, is not a postponement. It’s a change of course.”If in the days preceding the 70th anniversary of the UDHR, Paris saw scalding fire, Delhi saw a scorching ire. An unprecedented rally, with tens of thousands of farmers, men and women from all parts of India, catalysed by the intrepid spokesman for farmer and Dalit rights, Palagummi Sainath, and powered by kisan unions, converged in the national capital. They asked for farm loan waivers and for decent agricultural prices to be honoured. And then marching to Parliament, they demanded a session to discuss what has been a key concept in the UDHR: dignity. They asked that Parliament should discuss farmers’ dignity threatened by the agrarian crisis in India which has led, from 1998 to 2018, to the suicides of some 300,000 farmers. Speaker after speaker at the rally spoke of agriculture being India’s life, not just a feeder line.The language used in Paris and Delhi has great similarities: business gets tax-cuts, agriculture gets diesel hikes. Factories get investments, farms do not even get minimum prices, affecting a human right described in Article 23 of the UDHR: “Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.”Delhi’s wayEven as leaders of almost all major Opposition parties joined the rally, Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party government led by Arvind Kejriwal bolstered it with moral and material support. Delhi, instead of being the target, became the very life, the soul, of the farmers’ protest.But Paris’s flare and Delhi’s glare notwithstanding, the Declaration is under severe strain, globally. Primarily because governments are, literally, laws unto themselves and also because the UDHR, though it has become part of the constitution and laws of several countries which attained independence after it was proclaimed, is not legally binding. It stirs a nation’s conscience, not its laws. Law-makers and conscience-keepers coalesce but rarely. For most of the time, they are a species apart.Curbs on dissenters can be seen around the globe, from China to Brazil, from India through Egypt and Turkey to the U.S. Myanmar which says ‘no room’ to its own Rohingya disregards Article 14, and Pakistan which hounds out Asia Bibi disregards Article 18.Terrorism mutilates that most fundamental human right — to life. It has done that in India. On UDHR70 we mourn terror’s victims in Kashmir, among who are brave defence and security personnel on duty. But on UDHR70 we grieve no less for the pellet-blinded, the collaterally killed innocents of the Valley.Torture, physical and mental, has been used through time and around the globe by states and non-state tyrants. India, no exception to the gross pattern, signed, during I.K. Gujral’s prime ministership, the UN Convention Against Torture. But subsequent governments of India have refrained from ratifying it. Why? Do they think custodial torture is an inherent — read ‘internal’ — prerogative of statehood which the world has no business commenting on? Emotional pain and fear can be felt in a myriad ways. Group-isolating can be incredibly painful, frightening. The reported acquisition of land in Assam’s Goalpara district for a ‘detention camp’ has been denied by the government, but the prospect brings to mind detention scenes from the world’s history of ethnic ghetto-ing.Human rights violations are not a ‘state-gone berserk thing’ alone. Society violates it in India with vigour. If the invoking of ‘sedition’ reflects state intolerance, what is one to say of the murder in cold blood of dissenters and whistle-blowers? India bans in law but perpetuates in practice manual scavenging. It bans in law but lives with child marriage. It bans pre-natal gender screening but is unable to stop it and that which follows, female foeticide.Crimes against women, children in India seem unabating. We are in shame, unforgivable, unredeemable shame, to cite extreme examples, over the rape and murder of Nirbhaya in the national capital and of a child in Kashmir’s Kathua district. If the Kathua murder had bigotry lurking over it, the beheading of a 13-year-old Dalit girl in Tamil Nadu’s Salem district was laced with caste contempt. The Indian woman, if she is Dalit, tribal or vulnerable in age or personal circumstance, is all the more at risk.The Sentinelese’s reflexive act against the misguided tourist who beached on their quiet shore has scarcely been appreciated by the average Indian. But he will applaud the ill-advised plan to convert that ecologically fragile archipelago into a dazzling tourist haven.Rainbow on the horizonBut this anniversary must not let grim facts obscure the ‘rights rainbow’ on the sky.India’s judiciary is the first of its vibgyor colours. The Supreme Court’s emphatic position on the right to privacy, among others, stands out. As does its sage extension of the deadline for those contesting their non-inclusion in the National Register of Citizens for Assam. Justice S.K. Kaul’s order in the Madras High Court in the Perumal Murugan case, upholding the freedom of a writer to write, is something the UDHR would hail. Next, our Parliament, which has given us the Right to Information Act, following campaign advocacy by Aruna Roy and her colleagues. The third is that part of our media which will not be scared or suborned. The fourth, our security personnel, protecting our safety and our human rights activists protecting our liberty. The fifth, our creative cultural icons who will not surrender their autonomy. The sixth, our remarkable Constitution, B.R. Ambedkar’s legacy.And, finally, the seventh, vox populi! India’s free elections are a ‘UDHR asset’. The massive victory of the Left Front in Kerala’s just-concluded panchayat elections, overcoming the right-wing lurch on Sabarimala, shows a silent majority’s peaceable wisdom, and strength. Tomorrow, there will another unfurling of that rainbow.Paris, on December 10, 1948, liberated rights from state and social shackles. They must stay liberated, and celebrated.Gopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator, diplomat and governor"

Detain Ekbote ahead of Bhima-Koregaon anniversary, demands Bhim Army
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/detain-ekbote-ahead-of-bhima-koregaon-anniversary-demands-bhim-army/article25706063.ece,"
Hindutva leader has asked probe panel to deny permission to Bhim Army rally ",,"Hindutva leader Milind Ekbote, one of the accused in the Bhima-Koregaon clashes, has written to the Bhima-Koregaon inquiry panel urging them to deny permission to the Uttar Pradesh-based Bhim Army’s rally in Pune on December 30.The Bhim Army, in turn, has hit out at Mr. Ekbote, demanding that the Samasta Hindu Aghadi leader be detained ahead of the 201st anniversary celebration of the Koregaon-Bhima battle on January 1 to prevent him from aggravating social tensions.Datta Pol, the outfit’s Pune district president, said toThe Hinduon Sunday, “Who is Ekbote, who is named in an FIR as the chief instigator of the Bhima-Koregaon riots and is out on bail, to deny us permission? He has always disturbed the peace in the past with his inflammatory remarks. We urge the Pune Police not to give importance to his affidavit and place him under house arrest till the January 1 ceremony takes place peacefully.”Azad to visitThe Dalit outfit is planning to hold a Bhima-Koregaon Sangharsh Mahasabha at the SSPMS grounds on December 30, at which its leader Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ is expected to speak. Mr. Azad, who is scheduled to reach Maharashtra on December 28, will be speaking in Mumbai, Latur and Amravati as well.Earlier this week, appearing before the two-member Bhima-Koregaon inquiry commission, Mr. Ekbote said the Bhim Army’s proposed rally constituted a “new threat” to public peace and order. He said a rally held last year had “provoked” people and “promoted hatred and social division”.“The Jaysthambha [victory pillar at Bhima-Koregaon] is not only being treated as a religious place of worship, but a false historical narrative is being constructed by the political leaders from the Dalit community,” Mr. Ekbote said in his plea before the commission. He had also vehemently opposed the Elgaar Parishad held in the city on December 31 last year, a day before the clashes erupted at Bhima-Koregaon.Mr. Pol termed his claims as “ridiculous”, saying that the Bhima-Koregaon Ranstambh (victory pillar) was not a ‘religious place of worship’ and used to be frequented by members of the Dalit community even before Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s visit there in 1927.Meanwhile, Mr. Pol said the process of getting police permission for the rally was on. “The Bund Garden police, under whose jurisdiction our event falls, have asked us to submit documents on the arrangements at the venue. We are submitting them,” he said.RPI (A) calls for cautionMeanwhile, the Ramdas Athawale-led RPI (A) has urged the administration to deny permission to rallies being held within 500 metres of the victory pillar to maintain order during the celebrations. “We further appeal to individuals and parties to desist from spreading misinformation through social media and posters or making provocative speeches and statements calculated to cause discord between castes or communities,” RPI (A) leader Ashok Kamble said."

Tyranny of the majority
",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/tyranny-of-the-majority/article25704617.ece,"
India is bombarded with electoral rhetoric that is shorn of care for citizens who inhabit desolate worlds ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Every person who aspires to political power ought to read the book,Considerations on Representative Government,by John Stuart Mill. Ideally, democracy is not the best form of government, wrote Mill, unless it ensures that the majority is unable to reduce everyone, but itself, to political insignificance. The book neatly demolishes facile arguments that a majority group has some unspecified right to imprint its will on the body politic. In democracies, the very idea of majority rule is trumped by the grant of fundamental rights. Paramount among these is the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of religion, caste, class, gender and sexual preferences. What group we belong to, what faith we profess and what language we speak is irrelevant. Each citizen is an equal shareholder in the political system.A momentous transitionThe makers of our Constitution were committed to this understanding of democracy. On October 17, 1949, H.V. Kamath moved an amendment in the Constituent Assembly. The Preamble to the Constitution, he suggested, should begin with the phrase “In the name of God”. Similar amendments were moved by Shibban Lal Saxena and Govind Malaviya. Other members vociferously disagreed. Hriday Nath Kunzru observed that we should not impose our feelings on others: “We invoke the name of God, but I make bold to say that while we do so, we are showing a narrow sectarian spirit, which is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.” The amendment was defeated. The Constitution obligates the holders of power to respect the principle of religious neutrality.The commitment was significant, because by the mid-1940s religion no longer belonged to the realm of private faith. It had been transformed into a mode of politics that laid claims to power in the public domain. The transition proved momentous for Indian politics. Though prominent leaders assured minorities, time and again, that they would not be discriminated against for any reason, right-wing groups continued to assert that the religious majority had a natural right to rule India. This belief shaped the dark underside of collective political imaginations. Still these ideas were contained, at least till recently, by the intent and the framework of the Constitution.Take theS.R. Bommai v. Union of Indiacase (1994). The Supreme Court ruled that equality is the essential basis of the Constitution. Equality is a default principle, irrespective of the religious affiliation of citizens. Correspondingly the Indian state is not expected to privilege one religion over another, because it is neither religious nor irreligious. But matters are dramatically different today. Rulings of the Supreme Court are openly flouted by leaders of the BJP and its ideological cohorts. Shrill voices have become more aggressive and truculent. Cadres of the Hindutva brigade have no hesitation in intimidating citizens. The foundations of our democratic system tremble.Consider the provocative statements issued by right-wing leaders in the Sabarimala and Ayodhya cases. Political commentators find the escalation of hysteria and provocative speeches unsurprising. After all, we are at the end of Assembly elections in five States, and general elections are around the corner. The topmost priority has to be given to religious practices. The Prime Minister, who is required to represent the interests of all Indians, remains silent. Narendra Modi is seldom at a loss for words, but he cannot find the words to condemn the rising tide of bigotry and hate, and the insistent subversion of democracy.A crucial junctureIndia stands at a crucial juncture before the general elections. On the one hand is the party in power that has visited ill-being on the people through demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), harassment of universities, sabotage of institutions, violations of fundamental rights, the sanction of public lynchings, and now murder of a policeman. Gone is the emphasis onachhe din, the commitment to economic development, jobs, agrarian transformation, money in bank accounts, and governance. Today we see little else than religion as a frighteningly threatening form of politics.On the other hand stands the Congress, the inheritor of the legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Many Indians hoped that the party would relentlessly zero in on the dangerous threat to constitutional democracy. The party should have tapped minds and hearts with promises of restoration of the fundamental principles of constitutional democracy. It should have called for a second freedom struggle. But the Congress has opted to become an anaemic version of the BJP, with tilak-sporting, temple-going, and gotra-conscious leaders. The BJP has lived up to its ignoble reputation as a party of the majority and for the majority. The Congress has no distinctive ideology. It has forgotten the example set by Nehru. During the Partition riots, Nehru was physically there, in the killing fields of Punjab and in Delhi, persuading people to desist from violence, assuring Muslims safety, and protecting Indians against each other. Today the party fights shy of being branded as a protector of the rights of all Indians.Regional parties are hailed as a perfect political institution for a federal India. Yet most regional leaders, and their progeny, tend to treat their States as feudal fiefs. Fewer have a vision that is truly national. What has happened to political creativity, to projects that map out new paths, and to the confidence that democracy must be truly representative so that the majority does not reduce others to insignificance?Leaders should take inspiration from French President Emmanuel Macron. Along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he courageously took on some of the most populist of Europe’s leaders, at a function to mark a century since the end of World War I. He affirmed an axiom that had already been articulated by Rabindranath Tagore: “Patriotism is the opposite of nationalism.” In the audience were U.S. and Russian Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, respectively, two leaders who have adopted muscular nationalism as their political credo. Mr. Macron urged leaders not to forget the slaughter “one hundred years after a massacre whose scars are still visible on the face of the world”. There is a lesson to be learnt from this advice.In India, we are bombarded with electoral rhetoric that is shorn of care, compassion for, or commitment to citizens who live in frighteningly desolate worlds. These worlds are inhabited by impoverished farmers, insecure workers in the informal sector who lost their jobs after demonetisation and the imposition of GST, minorities who are increasingly rendered irrelevant, the so-called lower castes who are deprived of security, and women who are subjected to hateful stereotypes. Elections give citizens an opportunity to discuss policies and proposed political agendas, and exercise free choice. The forthcoming election breeds pessimism at the lack of choices.Neera Chandhoke is a former Professor of Political Science at Delhi University"

The fifth, our creative cultural icons who will not surrender their autonomy. The sixth, our remarkable Constitution, B.R. Ambedkar’s legacy.And, finally, the seventh, vox populi! India’s free elections are a ‘UDHR asset’. The massive victory of the Left Front in Kerala’s just-concluded panchayat elections, overcoming the right-wing lurch on Sabarimala, shows a silent majority’s peaceable wisdom, and strength.

Tyranny of the majority

India is bombarded with electoral rhetoric that is shorn of care for citizens who inhabit desolate worlds
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Every person who aspires to political power ought to read the book,Considerations on Representative Government,by John Stuart Mill. Ideally, democracy is not the best form of government, wrote Mill, unless it ensures that the majority is unable to reduce everyone, but itself, to political insignificance. The book neatly demolishes facile arguments that a majority group has some unspecified right to imprint its will on the body politic. In democracies, the very idea of majority rule is trumped by the grant of fundamental rights. Paramount among these is the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of religion, caste, class, gender and sexual preferences. What group we belong to, what faith we profess and what language we speak is irrelevant. Each citizen is an equal shareholder in the political system.A momentous transitionThe makers of our Constitution were committed to this understanding of democracy. On October 17, 1949, H.V. Kamath moved an amendment in the Constituent Assembly. The Preamble to the Constitution, he suggested, should begin with the phrase “In the name of God”. Similar amendments were moved by Shibban Lal Saxena and Govind Malaviya. Other members vociferously disagreed. Hriday Nath Kunzru observed that we should not impose our feelings on others: “We invoke the name of God, but I make bold to say that while we do so, we are showing a narrow sectarian spirit, which is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.” The amendment was defeated. The Constitution obligates the holders of power to respect the principle of religious neutrality.The commitment was significant, because by the mid-1940s religion no longer belonged to the realm of private faith. It had been transformed into a mode of politics that laid claims to power in the public domain. The transition proved momentous for Indian politics. Though prominent leaders assured minorities, time and again, that they would not be discriminated against for any reason, right-wing groups continued to assert that the religious majority had a natural right to rule India. This belief shaped the dark underside of collective political imaginations. Still these ideas were contained, at least till recently, by the intent and the framework of the Constitution.Take theS.R. Bommai v. Union of Indiacase (1994). The Supreme Court ruled that equality is the essential basis of the Constitution. Equality is a default principle, irrespective of the religious affiliation of citizens. Correspondingly the Indian state is not expected to privilege one religion over another, because it is neither religious nor irreligious. But matters are dramatically different today. Rulings of the Supreme Court are openly flouted by leaders of the BJP and its ideological cohorts. Shrill voices have become more aggressive and truculent. Cadres of the Hindutva brigade have no hesitation in intimidating citizens. The foundations of our democratic system tremble.Consider the provocative statements issued by right-wing leaders in the Sabarimala and Ayodhya cases. Political commentators find the escalation of hysteria and provocative speeches unsurprising. After all, we are at the end of Assembly elections in five States, and general elections are around the corner. The topmost priority has to be given to religious practices. The Prime Minister, who is required to represent the interests of all Indians, remains silent. Narendra Modi is seldom at a loss for words, but he cannot find the words to condemn the rising tide of bigotry and hate, and the insistent subversion of democracy.A crucial junctureIndia stands at a crucial juncture before the general elections. On the one hand is the party in power that has visited ill-being on the people through demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), harassment of universities, sabotage of institutions, violations of fundamental rights, the sanction of public lynchings, and now murder of a policeman. Gone is the emphasis onachhe din, the commitment to economic development, jobs, agrarian transformation, money in bank accounts, and governance. Today we see little else than religion as a frighteningly threatening form of politics.On the other hand stands the Congress, the inheritor of the legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Many Indians hoped that the party would relentlessly zero in on the dangerous threat to constitutional democracy. The party should have tapped minds and hearts with promises of restoration of the fundamental principles of constitutional democracy. It should have called for a second freedom struggle. But the Congress has opted to become an anaemic version of the BJP, with tilak-sporting, temple-going, and gotra-conscious leaders. The BJP has lived up to its ignoble reputation as a party of the majority and for the majority. The Congress has no distinctive ideology. It has forgotten the example set by Nehru. During the Partition riots, Nehru was physically there, in the killing fields of Punjab and in Delhi, persuading people to desist from violence, assuring Muslims safety, and protecting Indians against each other. Today the party fights shy of being branded as a protector of the rights of all Indians.Regional parties are hailed as a perfect political institution for a federal India. Yet most regional leaders, and their progeny, tend to treat their States as feudal fiefs. Fewer have a vision that is truly national. What has happened to political creativity, to projects that map out new paths, and to the confidence that democracy must be truly representative so that the majority does not reduce others to insignificance?Leaders should take inspiration from French President Emmanuel Macron. Along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he courageously took on some of the most populist of Europe’s leaders, at a function to mark a century since the end of World War I. He affirmed an axiom that had already been articulated by Rabindranath Tagore: “Patriotism is the opposite of nationalism.” In the audience were U.S. and Russian Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, respectively, two leaders who have adopted muscular nationalism as their political credo. Mr. Macron urged leaders not to forget the slaughter “one hundred years after a massacre whose scars are still visible on the face of the world”. There is a lesson to be learnt from this advice.In India, we are bombarded with electoral rhetoric that is shorn of care, compassion for, or commitment to citizens who live in frighteningly desolate worlds. These worlds are inhabited by impoverished farmers, insecure workers in the informal sector who lost their jobs after demonetisation and the imposition of GST, minorities who are increasingly rendered irrelevant, the so-called lower castes who are deprived of security, and women who are subjected to hateful stereotypes. Elections give citizens an opportunity to discuss policies and proposed political agendas, and exercise free choice. The forthcoming election breeds pessimism at the lack of choices.Neera Chandhoke is a former Professor of Political Science at Delhi University"

Macron to meet trade unions, local officials

French President wants to ‘hear their voices and proposals’ on Monday, says presidential palace
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"French President Emmanuel Macron will meet representatives of trade unions, employers’ organisations and associations of local elected officials on Monday, an Élysée palace source said on Sunday. The meeting, which will take place at 0900 GMT, follows a fourth weekend of violent “yellow vest” riots in which anti-government protesters threw stones, torched cars and vandalised shops and restaurants across the country.“The President wants to bring together all the political, territorial, economic and social forces at these difficult times for the nation, in order to hear their voices and proposals with a view to mobilise them into action,” the source said.Cleaning the messEarlier, workers in Paris swept up broken glass and towed away burnt-out cars on Sunday after the latest violent “yellow vest” protest while the government announced that Mr. Macron would address the nation in the next few days.Across the city, bank branch offices, toy shops, opticians and other retail outlets had boarded up storefronts smashed by protesters, and walls were covered in anti-Macron slogans. “You won’t make it past Christmas, Emmanuel,” read the graffiti on a boarded-up shop near the Champs-Élysées boulevard.Mr. Macron, elected in May 2017, is facing mounting criticism for not speaking in public in more than a week as violence worsened.The upheaval in the Christmas shopping season has dealt a heavy blow to retailing, the tourist industry and the manufacturing sector as road blocks disrupt supply chains.The protest movement will have “a severe impact” on the French economy, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday as he toured an upmarket central Paris neighbourhood that had seen heavy looting on Saturday night.Anti-Macron rebellionThe government this week cancelled a planned rise in taxes on petrol and diesel in a bid to defuse the situation but the protests have morphed into a broader anti-Macron rebellion.Mr. Macron’s last major address was on November 27, when he said he would not be forced into changing policy by ”thugs”. “The President of the Republic will ... make important announcements,” government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said on LCI television on Sunday."

Thick plumes of black smoke from fires could be seen rising high into the sky over the city.Govt. plea failsThe government’s calls for protesters to stay away from “Act IV” of a battle that began over fuel prices but ballooned into an anti-Macron revolt fell on deaf ears, with demonstrators making their way to Paris from across the country. In the Grands Boulevards shopping district, masked protesters threw rocks at the riot police and set fire to a barricade hastily assembled from stolen dustbins and Christmas trees.The demonstrators began blockading roads over rising fuel taxes on November 17 but their list of demands have since grown, with many calling for the resignation of Macron, whom they accuse of favouring the rich.Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said 31,000 people were taking part in protests nationwide, including 8,000 in Paris. Around 700 people were detained, most of them in Paris."

Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ is expected to speak at the event.Mr. Azad, who is scheduled to reach Maharashtra on December 28, will be speaking in Mumbai, Latur and Amravati as well.Threat to public peace and order, says EkboteEarlier this week, appearing before the two-member Bhima-Koregaon inquiry commission, Mr. Ekbote submitted that the Bhim Army’s proposed rally constituted a “new threat” to public peace and order.Mr. Ekbote claimed that a rally held last year had “provoked” people and “promoted hatred and social division”.“The Jaysthambha [victory pillar at Bhima-Koregaon] is not only being treated as a religious place for worship, but a false historical narrative is being constructed by the political leaders from the Dalit community,” Mr. Ekbote said in his plea.Mr. Ekbote, who heads ‘Samasta Hindu Aghadi’, had vehemently opposed the ‘Elgaar Parishad’ held last year on December 31, a day before the clashes erupted at the village of Bhima-Koregaon.Police permissionSlamming Mr. Ekbote, Mr. Pol denigrated his claims as “ridiculous”, commenting that the Bhima-Koregaon Ranstambh (victory pillar) was not a ‘religious place of worship’ and used to be frequented by members from the Dalit community even before Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s visit there in 1927.Mr. Pol further said that the process of getting police permission to hold the rally was on and that a few formalities needed to be completed.“The Bund Garden police, under whose jurisdiction our proposed event falls, has asked us to submit documents pertaining to the arrangements at the venue. We are in the process of submitting the same,” he informed.Meanwhile, the Ramdas Athawale-led RPI (A) has urged the administration to deny permission to rallies being held within 500 metres of the victory pillar in a bid to maintain order during the celebrations.“We further appeal to individuals and parties to desist from spreading misinformation through social media and posters or uttering provocative speeches and statements calculated to cause discord between castes or communities,” said RPI (A) leader Ashok Kamble.While lakhs of Dalits converged on the victory pillar (Ranstambh or Jayastambh) each year to pay their respects, the celebrations this year were marred by riots that left one person dead besides aggravating social tensions across Maharashtra.Since then, there have been two investigations into the affair. ThePune Rural police has lodged an FIRagainst right-wing Hindutva leaders Sambhaji Bhide ‘Guruji’ and Milind Ekbote, naming them as the orchestrators of the violence.ThePune City police have conducted multi-city crackdowns across the countryand have arrested ten noted intellectuals and activists including advocateSurendra Gadling, Professor Shoma Sen, poet P.

However, taking objection to the same, the Tamil Nadu government said that the government “will not say that the protesters were naxalites”. The State government said that FIRs were lodged against the protesters as there was a “law and order situation”.In response to Vedanta’s contention that the State government cannot issue closure orders on environmental grounds, the Tamil Nadu government argued that the closure order was a policy decision, which could not be challenged in the NGT.During the hearing, counsel appearing for the mining major argued that the Sterlite plant, when functional, accounted for 36% of copper production in the country. Further, it was said that due to the unit’s closure, the country’s imports had risen by 247%.The State government will continue its arguments before the green panel on Monday.Meanwhile, security was beefed up in Thoothukudi during the NGT hearing in New Delhi.Around 800 police personnel were deployed at various places perceived as sensitive in the town, and riot-control vehicles were kept on standby."

A Special Investigation Team is probing the violence.

Incidentally, the name Jeetu Fauji had appeared among the 27 named persons in the FIR lodged in the mob violence earlier this week.As per the report in the daily, the claim was made by the police on the basis of a video in which the jawan is allegedly seen firing at the officer.The Army said “fullest cooperation is being extended” to the UP police and added that, “Details would be released by Police at appropriate time after positive identification.” “Since the matter is under investigation no other comment can be offered,” the Army said in a statement.

Bhagat, IG crime.Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was shot dead in mob violence on Monday in the Syana area of Bulandshahr after right-wing groups alleged cow slaughter and laid siege to the Chingrawati police outpost.A civilian, Sumit Singh, whom some videos have shown to be a part of stone-pelting mob, also died of bullet injuries.Mother’s statementJeetu’s mother, however, claimed that he was posted in Kargil and she had not seen him for the past few months. But if he was guilty of the crime, she told a television channel, “I will kill him myself.”The jawan’s family alleged that the police had vandalised their house after his name surfaced in the case.Meanwhile, five more youth have been arrested in connection with the mob violence, taking the total to nine, police said.

French police clash with ‘yellow vest’ protesters on Champs Elysees

Eiffel Tower closed as precaution, shops boarded up; Government, in climbdown, has abandoned fuel tax
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"French riot police fired tear gas canisters at “yellow vest” protesters in central Paris on Saturday at the start of a planned demonstration against the high cost of living under President Emmanuel Macron.A police spokeswoman told reporters there were about 1,500 protesters on the Champs Elysees boulevard and authorities said 211 people had been arrested after police found weapons such as hammers, baseball bats and metal petanque balls on them.Also ReadFrance drops fuel tax as “yellow vest” anger persistsHundreds of protesters were milling around the Arc de Triomphe monument, which was defaced with graffiti last Saturday, when rioters also torched cars and looted shops.“We will do all we can so that today can be a day without violence, so that the dialogue that we started this week can continue in the best possible circumstances,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on French television.On Tuesday Mr. Philippe announced the government was suspending planned increases to fuel taxes for at least six months to help defuse weeks of protests, the first U-turn by Mr. Macron since he came to power 18 months ago.About 89,000 police were deployed across France on December 8, some 8,000 of them in Paris.“We have prepared a robust response,” Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told online news siteBrut. He called on peaceful protesters not to get mixed up with “hooligans”.“The troublemakers can only be effective when they disguise themselves as yellow vests. Violence is never a good way to get what you want. Now is the time for discussion,” he said.“If you are not aggressive, we will not be aggressive, a masked policeman said as a protester stuck yellow plastic flowers onto policemen.Ghost townMuch of Paris looked like a ghost town on December 8, with museums, department stores closed on what should have been a festive pre-Christmas shopping day.Also ReadFrench govt. could consider bringing back wealth taxTourists were few and residents were advised to stay at home if at all possible. Dozens of streets were closed to traffic, while the Eiffel Tower and world-famous museums such as the Musee d’Orsay, the Centre Pompidou and the Louvre were shut.Many shops were boarded up to avoid looting and street furniture and construction site materials have been removed to prevent them from being used as projectiles.“We have come here for a peaceful march, not to smash things. We want equality, we want to live, not survive,” said Guillaume Le Grac, 28, who works in a slaughterhouse in the town of Guingamp in Britanny.Protesters, using social media, have billed the weekend as “Act IV” in a dramatic challenge to Mr. Macron and his policies.Demand continuesThe protests, named after the high-visibility safety jackets French motorists have to keep in their cars, erupted in November over the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes.Demonstrations have since swelled into a broad, sometimes violent rebellion against Mr. Macron, a challenge made more difficult to handle since the movement has no formal leader.Authorities say the protests have been hijacked by far-right and anarchist elements bent on violence and stirring up social unrest in a direct affront to Mr. Macron and the security forces.Despite the government’s climbdown over the fuel tax, the ‘yellow vests’ continue to demand more concessions, including lower taxes, a higher minimum wage, lower energy costs, better retirement benefits and even Mr. Macron’s resignation."

Paris in lockdown as France braces for new anti-Macron riots

About 89,000 police were deployed across the country.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Paris was in lockdown early on Saturday with thousands of French security forces braced to meet renewed rioting by“yellow vest” protesters in the capitaland other cities in a fourth weekend of confrontation over living costs.The Eiffel Tower and other tourist landmarks were shut, shops were boarded up to avoid looting and street furniture removed to avoid metal bars from being used as projectiles.About 89,000 police were deployed across the country.Of these, about 8,000 were deployed in Paris to avoid a repeat of last Saturday's mayhem when rioters torched cars and looted shops off the famed Champs Elysees boulevard, and defaced the Arc de Triomphe with graffiti directed at President Emmanuel Macron.Also ReadThe Hindu explains: Why are riots happening in France?Protesters, using social media, have billed the weekend as ”Act IV” in a dramatic challenge to Macron and his policies.The protests, named after the high-visibility safety jackets French motorists have to keep in their cars, erupted in November over the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes.Demonstrations have since swelled into a broad, sometimes-violent rebellion against Macron - a challenge made more difficult to handle since the movement has no formal leader.Authorities say the protests have been hijacked by far-right and anarchist elements bent on violence and stirring up social unrest in a direct affront to Macron and the security forces.Nonetheless, the 40-year-old Macron, whose popularity is at a low ebb according to polls, has been forced into making the first major U-turn of his presidency by abandoning a fuel tax.Despite the climbdown, the “yellow vests” continue to demand more concessions from the government, including lower taxes, higher salaries, cheaper energy costs, better retirement provisions and even Macron's resignation.One of them, Eric Drouet, a truck driver, called on protesters to storm into the Elysee presidential palace. An Elysee official has said intelligence suggested that some protesters would come to the capital “to vandalise and to kill”.Macron, who has not spoken in public since he condemned last Saturday's disturbances while at the G20 summit in Argentina, will address the nation early next week, his office said.On Friday evening, he visited a group of police in their barracks outside Paris, his office said.Navigating his biggest crisis since being elected 18 months ago, Macron has left it largely to his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to deal in public with the turmoil and offer concessions.But he is under pressure to speak more fully as his administration tries to regain the initiative following three weeks of unrest that are the worst since the 1968 student riots.In a sign the concessions offered by the government may be starting to weaken support for the movement, two opinion polls showed a decline in popularity for the “yellow vests” on Friday.The protests were supported by 66 percent of respondents in an Ifop-Fiducial poll for CNews TV, down six percentage points since a previous poll carried out on December 3-4."

Willing to invest Rs. 100 crore on development work: Vedanta to NGT

‘Protests were due to expansion plans, not pollution concerns’
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Vedanta Ltd. on Friday told the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that it was willing to invest Rs. 100 crore on development work in Thoothukudi, apart from its investment of Rs. 10 crore per annum on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects.The company said that the funds would be used to improve water supply, provide schooling and build hospitals in the town.The submissions came while a Bench, headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, was hearing a plea moved by Vedanta, challenging the Tamil Nadu government’s order to shut down its Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi.Following the submission of a report by the NGT-appointed independent committee, both the company and the State government had been asked to file their respective responses to the report before the tribunal.During the hearing, Vedanta’s counsel said that the agitation which took place in May was a result of the proposal to expand the plant and not because of pollution, as was mentioned by the State government in its order.Further, Vedanta said that “naxalites” were behind the anti-Sterlite protests. However, taking objection to the same, the Tamil Nadu government said that the government “will not say that the protesters were naxalites”. The State government said that FIRs were lodged against the protesters as there was a “law and order situation”.In response to Vedanta’s contention that the State government cannot issue closure orders on environmental grounds, the Tamil Nadu government argued that the closure order was a policy decision, which could not be challenged in the NGT.During the hearing, counsel appearing for the mining major argued that the Sterlite plant, when functional, accounted for 36% of copper production in the country. Further, it was said that due to the unit’s closure, the country’s imports had risen by 247%.The State government will continue its arguments before the green panel on Monday.Meanwhile, security was beefed up in Thoothukudi during the NGT hearing in New Delhi.Around 800 police personnel were deployed at various places perceived as sensitive in the town, and riot-control vehicles were kept on standby."

But police insisted they prevented demonstrators from trying to storm the court.Mr. Shehbaz has been held in custody by the National Accountability Bureau since October. Also on Thursday in Lahore, hundreds of farmers rallied to demand a decrease in the prices of fertilisers, pesticides and seeds, and to pressure authorities so that they could get higher prices for sugarcane and other items."

She also mentioned that the last time she visited the police station, her husband had received a phone call from a local BJP MLA (Devendra Lodhi) after three persons were arrested on charges of cow slaughter. However, the context and details could not be verified as the video ends abruptly.A government statement following the meeting said Mr. Adityanath promised the family that those involved in the murder would “not be spared” and “strong action will be taken against them.”The government has promised to dedicate a school and a road to the memory of the officer in his native Etah. The government had already announced an ex-gratia compensation of Rs. 50 lakh to the family. Their education and housing loans would also be taken care of by the State.Claims innocenceMeanwhile, another prime accused in the mob violence case, Shikhar Agarwal, released a video from an undisclosed location and claimed that he was innocent.Introducing himself as the BJP’s Bulandshahr Yuva Morcha city president, Agarwal called the officer “corrupt” and accused him of siding with the Muslims.He blamed the officer for creating a tense atmosphere.Agarwal said Subodh Kumar had stopped him and his friends from carrying the cow carcasses on a trolley to the police outpost to lodge an FIR and had asked them to “bury it at the spot” instead.He alleged that the officer then threatened to shoot him.He said he left the spot after handing over the complaint lodged by Bajrang Bali activist Yogesh Raj to the authorities."

The violence erupted when riot police used batons to prevent them from reaching an anti-graft tribunal where Mr. Shehbaz appeared before the court for a pre-trial hearing over alleged links to a multimillion-dollar housing scam.Police also detained several activists, angering the country’s Opposition parties, which in turn urged Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government to immediately free those detained.According to Maryam Aurangzeb, a spokeswoman for Mr. Shehbaz’s Pakistan Muslim League, police beat the party’s supporters without any provocation. But police insisted they prevented demonstrators from trying to storm the court.Mr. Shehbaz has been held in custody by the National Accountability Bureau since October. Also on Thursday in Lahore, hundreds of farmers rallied to demand a decrease in the prices of fertilisers, pesticides and seeds, and to pressure authorities so that they could get higher prices for sugarcane and other items."

‘The tragedy is that art has become vocal’

In pursuit of pure art, A Ramachandran talks about his abiding romance with lotus and how literature informs his craft
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Unlike the densely populated lotus ponds on his canvas, it is easier to navigate A Ramachandran’s mind. On a balmy afternoon, the veteran artist turns to his background in literature and music to take one through his distinguished career where he swam against the tide to create an Indian idiom in modern art. With a walking stick in hand, the 83-year-old took us to the lotus ponds of Ubeshwar, Nagada, Jogi Talab and Ekalinji near Udaipur to explain their changing moods.“I was fascinated by the Bhil tribe and during my journeys to Rajasthan, I discovered these ponds,” says Ramachandran. “I used to go three or four times a year and spend a week there. I would start in the morning and start sketching. The more I sketched, the more I understood. As an artist, I could see the contour lines – I always use contour lines. When you see the rhythmic lines, you notice the decorative patterns of nature. Nature is more decorative,” he insists as you would discover later. “I used to take a boat. The leaves would give me passage and when I would cross they would close again. It was like a mother’s womb, wet, slimy and full of insects. The patches of skyline above made it a visual delight,” exults the Padma Bhushan who learnt his craft at Santiniketan under the watchful eyes of Nandlal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij.“The way of teaching in Santiniketan was to ask students to go out and sketch. It was not like the British academic system. The student was expected to look outside and start drawing himself without a static model. They wanted students to observe nature and sketch whatever they liked. That practice has stopped but if you can achieve it, you have the freedom to become an artist of your own stature. You need not borrow concepts from somebody else or copy some other artist’s style. This way your work will be your own interpretation of the world.”After studying at Santiniketan, unlike his contemporaries, Ramachandran didn’t go abroad to find his artistic moorings. When he came to Delhi, he started working with contemporaries like Krishen Khanna and Tyeb Mehta and later joined Jamia Millia Islamia as a faculty in Fine Arts department. “After some time, I had a feeling that I have something different and distinct in my genes as a Malayali.” A post graduate in Malayalam literature, Ramachandran was in touch with most of the progressive writers of the language including Vaikom Mohammad Basheer. “They changed the Malayalam literature from a highly Sanskritised form to something that talked about social realism in a colloquial form. In the same way, I felt that if I would paint my realities, the appeal would be universal. You need not follow European trends to show that you are making modern art. Of course, I had used them in my early works when my concerns were more political, but I gradually gave that up. Like pure music, I wanted to do pure painting. Art carries much more authenticity when you handle things which are intimate to you.”Despite the efforts of his teachers, Ramachandran feels that we never really developed the Indian way of teaching art. “We are so overawed by Picasso and Matisse that we are importing ideas and exporting products. Malayalam writers did draw from Maupassant and Flaubert but once they looked around their own life, they developed a new idiom. Basheer only wrote about his family and the Muslim community in a colloquial language. That’s the modernism of Malayalam literature. I am looking for that kind of modernism in Indian art. You not only have to look inward but also be authentic.”Excerpts from a free-wheeling conversation:You were also inspired by the likes of Fyodor Dostoevsky...Yes, but you cannot put Dostoevsky in pictorial form. I had to have something else. Even Dostoevsky had to open the Bible before he wroteCrime and Punishmentand that lends it a spiritual quality. To me, art is not political journalism, which is very temporary. Today, if you make a painting on the Emergency, it carries no weight. Even Partition has been erased out of people’s memory. Such a calamity should have produced great works. Artists like Krishen Khanna and Satish Gujral did create some works but not like what Manto did in literature.So you don’t like socio-political messaging through artworks?Van Gogh didn’t do any political work. His ‘Sunflowers’ is greater than Picasso’s ‘Guernica’. ‘Guernica’ didn’t end any world war. There is still a war going on. It worked because some features of war in it functioned very well in a political way. Hariprasad Chaurasiya doesn’t utter a word but he is a great musician. Music has its own status. Similarly, I feel, painting has its own status. It need not carry message and slogans on the surface. It need not shout at a high pitch. A quiet work can affect you as well.When I watched slaughtering of goats in the Kamakhya temple, I was shocked by human beings turning into animals. Even a child there had tremendous violence on his face. Around the same time, there was the Naxalite Movement where young, bright students were being killed by the State. In that background, I made “Kali Puja” (1972). It was a political statement. But, today, my lotus speaks far better.What does it stand for?It speaks for something greater in life. It shows the world that we have got is so beautiful; it needs to be preserved. When I first visited Udaipur, it was an untouched land. Now after 40 years of my travel, I find it hard to find wild lotus ponds. Many of them have beencleanedup and made into bathing ghats with marble steps.Also, as an artist the more you contemplate in nature, the more you understand that there is another universe where we are superfluous. I cannot explain it in an urban environment. It is a spiritual feeling that you get when you are in nature, looking at not just the lotus but also its leaves, the insects that make them their home, the fungi in the water...we don’t have that kind of perception. We only want to cut flowers.Why did you move away from realism to mythical forms?In 1984, I saw the anti-Sikh riots in front of my eyes. I saw a Sikh person being chased by 20 persons. In Kerala, I had not seen social violence. I realised it is very nice to read grotesque things in novels but actually encountering it is a bit too much.When I saw it, I told myself what I have been doing is making rasogullah out of human tears. After all, a work of art is a beautiful object. That day the individual asked the artist what is the use of doing it. If you want to change society, you should become Baba Amte or Mother Teresa. If a writer or an artist thinks that he can solve the problems of the world, he is living in a fool’s paradise.Perhaps, that was the time when your works were described as decorativeIt is decorative. I was trying to create a new language which was suitable for modern India because of my training from a school which started working on this visual language in the pre-Independent period. Nandlal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij were trying to create an Indian visual language. It was not an extension of what was happening abroad. I wanted to take it closer to my home in Kerala. So I did a thesis on Kerala paintings. I started realising that the grammar of Oriental art is totally different. There is no realism in the way you understand it in Europe. There, you don’t go beyond the skin, here you create a parallel body which is not there but creates a beautiful feeling. It is like Malayalam language grammar is different from that of English. If you don’t know the grammar, you cannot play with the language.Also, people forget that decorativeness is part of Indian psyche. We see it in our temples and churches and in our music and dance. The word was used by Europeans to describe our work in a derogatory sense when they failed to come to terms with Oriental art.You mastered this language with ‘Yayati’I did a very close study of Indian miniature and wall paintings. One must understand that I never painted gods and goddesses. In ‘Yayati’, what I did was what Girish Karnad achieved in ‘Tughlaq’ – using myth to interpret something else. In the present day context., ‘Yayati’ is a painting which deals with a modern man’s endless search for pleasure. Now it could be a telephone or a lift – a modern man’s desperation to live as perfect as possible. This has brought us to the level of complete environmental degradation.Were you the first one to make this shift?No, Nandlal Bose did it. Abanindranath did it. They were my heroes. To move away from the British influence, the Constitution and Padma awards were designed by Nandlal.How was your experience at Jamia?Jamia was good for me. At that time, it was outside the city. There were very enlightened people in the administration. I did ‘Kali Puja’, headless and nude images in the studio but nobody said anything to me. Artist Abul Kalam, who brought me, was a student of Nandlal Bose. There were no jarring notes. As I was a practising artist, I could come to the city and show my work at Kumar Gallery with other major artists.You also like to make an appearance in your paintingsThat’s because of the Malayali sense of humour. We have a sutradhar or a narrator who connects scenes. I appear as insects, birds and even as a bat, which signifies that I am neither contemporary nor ancient. I am neither a bird nor a beast.As a sculptor, what is your take on the proliferation of statues?Most of them are portraits and have a ‘gudiya’ approach. They are not artistic. In comparison, Pushkin’s statue, in front of Rabindra Bhawan, stands out. It has movement and action. You see, great monuments are made by great patrons.Does an artist have a retirement age?After retirement, I decided that I would devote my life to painting. I go into my studio at 10.30-11am and come down around 7.30-8 pm. I have a good library and a good collection of miniatures.I am not the only one Nandlal Bose could not walk but still would do one painting every day. I believe every artist should work very hard. There is no point in waiting for inspiration. There is nothing of that sort. You have to work like a daily labourer. Once I finish I don’t even look at it. I put it in storage and it goes to the gallery. I move to a new challenge. If you ask me to copy my work, I can’t. People think there is a formula, there is none. Even if I apply the same colour again, I will not get the same effect. I may be going and sketching but there is no lotus like these. They are born in my mind...."

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Uttar Pradesh administration is shielding the accused in the Bulandshahr riot case and harassing the innocent, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Thursday.He was speaking at a rally organised by the five Left parties on the 26th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition, which they are observing as ‘Defend the Constitution and Secularism Day.’ The rally was attended by the CPI(M), the CPI, All-India Forward Block, the Revolutionary Socialist Party and CPI(ML).Subodh Kumar Singh, Station House Officer (SHO) of Siyana police station in Bulandshahr district, was shot dead and a 21-year-old youth, Sumit, was killed in police cross-fire on Monday.Mr. Yechury accused the ruling BJP of spreading the worst kind of communalism for their electoral benefit. It was a dangerous situation where the government itself was the biggest threat to the country’s unity and integrity. He charged the Uttar Pradesh administration headed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath with sheltering the accused in the Bulandshahr riot case. “They could not save their own police officer. And now, instead of acting against the men who killed him, they are harassing the innocent,” Mr. Yechury said.Mandir issueThe BJP, he said, had proclaimed before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections that they would abide by the Supreme Court order on Ram Mandir and now they were creating a frenzy to bring an ordinance on the temple issue. In the last four years and seven months, the ruling BJP was silent on the Ayodhya temple issue and it was being raked again as the next general election was approaching. “Their [the BJP and the RSS] agenda is to garner votes by playing the communal card. The act of the BJP will destroy the secular and democratic character of the country,” he said.D.

Things like cross-media ownership have given them the power to manufacture opinion, even swing the elections. It’s a complex scenario where the time-tested role of media as a source of information has taken the backseat. Structural changes within media houses further accentuated the change.It’s made worse, with the government frowning upon dissent. There’s a clear attempt to muzzle free opinion when independent news sites are bombarded with defamation suits,” says Mr. Madhavan, who had worked as a journalist in Lucknow before his selection to the IAS.But he has a lasting faith in the discerning ability of the reader/listener. In strong democracies like the U.S. where institutions have retained their autonomy, the media have put up a brave defence of freedom.He also sees the advent of portals busting fake news as a sign of latent resilience building up on ground.In his introduction to a collection of his favourite stories, Mr. Madhavan wonders if the history of post-independence India would be marked by communally charged pogroms – the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the post-Babri Masjid demolition riots and the 2002 Gujarat riots prominent among them. His stories illustrate the ‘weight of history physically impacting’ individuals, as sister Agatha, a Malayali nun at a monastery in UP, feels inVanmarangal Veezhumbol(When Big Trees Fall), written on the riots of 1984."

France drops fuel tax as “yellow vest” anger persists

The movement began with the aim of highlighting the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes but morphed into a broader, sometimes-violent rebellion against President Macron
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"President Emmanuel Macron's government is dropping further fuel-tax hikes in next year's budget in the face of protests across France over living costs, the country’s Prime Minister said on December 5, a day after announcing their suspension for six months.The Macron administration is struggling to defuse the anger driving the “yellow vest” protests, as it reels from the worst riots seen in central Paris in five decades last Saturday.“The government is ready for dialogue and is showing it because this tax increase has been dropped from the 2019 budget bill,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told the lower house of parliament. The concession was the latest attempt to quell the worst crisis of Macron's presidency after announcing the six-month suspension only the day before.His government indicated earlier that it could also amend a wealth tax that Macron shrank last year to cover only real estate assets, earning him criticism as the “president of the rich”. A Macron aide denied that any eventual revision of the wealth tax would represent a major climb-down by Macron, a pro-business former investment banker, adding that the president remained committed to his reform drive.Also ReadThe Hindu explains: Why are riots happening in France?Government spokesperson Benjamin Griveaux said all tax-related policies needed to be periodically evaluated and, if deemed not to be working, should be changed. He said the wealth tax could be reassessed in the autumn of 2019. “If a measure that we have taken, which is costing the public money, turns out not to be working, if it's not going well, we're not stupid - we would change it,” Griveaux toldRTL radio.The unrest over the squeeze on household budgets comes as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data showed that France has become the most highly taxed country in the developed world, surpassing even high-tax Denmark. Griveaux later told a weekly news conference that Macron had called on all political parties, trade unions and business leaders to press the need for calm.Student protests and planned trade union strikes in the energy and port sectors underscored the risk of contagion. Security sources said the government was considering using troops currently used on anti-terrorism patrols to protect public buildings.U-TURNThe “yellow vest” movement — so-called because of the high-vis jackets worn by protesters — began with the aim of highlighting the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes but morphed into a broader, sometimes-violent rebellion against President Macron. His administration's shift on fuel tax came after rioters ran amok in central Paris, torching cars, looting boutiques vandalising cafes and private residences and cafes in affluent neighbourhoods.Also ReadFrench government set for tax U-turn to quell “yellow vest” protestsPrime Minister Philippe earlier said the six-month suspension to the carbon-tax would be used to examine other measures to bolster household spending power. It marked the first major U-turn by Macron in his 18-months in office, at a time polls show that barely one in five French people think he is doing a good job. Nearly seven out of eight people told pollsters that the measures did not satisfy the movement's demands, according to an Elabe survey forBFM TV. The poll also found that although 82% were against the violence and 72 % supported the “gilets jaunes” movement.U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to mock Macron over the policy shift, which could make it harder for France to meet its CO2 emissions reduction target, a core element of the Paris climate agreement of 2015. “I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago,” Trump tweeted late on December 4, as U.N. climate talks take place in Poland on how to enforce global action. “The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters.”Adding to Macron's difficulties, college students are agitating and the hardline CGT trade union on December 5 called for strikes in the energy industry and at ports on Dec. 13."

Mr. Owaisi was responding to questions at a media conference held at Hyderabad Press Club.“Rahul Gandhi is a Janeudhari Hindu. A Janeudhari Hindu thinks everyone is lesser than him. But the Indian Constitution considers everyone equal,” Mr. Owaisi said. Congress party is losing in elections because of Rahul Gandhi, he slammed. “We need regional parties to represent aspirations of Telangana,” he said, adding TDP and Congress rule brought no development in the region. Telangana’s electorate should not allow Chandrababu Naidu to rule Telangana from Andhra Pradesh, he added.Mr. Owaisi made an open appeal to the electorate to bring K. Chandrasekhar back to power. Muslim community in Telangana is aware that communal riots have not broken out in Hyderabad after TRS came to power, he said. “The fear factor among Muslims in other States is non-existent in Telangana. AIMIM’s contribution in maintaining peace in the State will be recognised by the electorate,” Mr. Owaisi said. Brushing aside allegations that AIMIM contested in several seats in other States including Uttar Pradesh to split votes in favour of BJP even as in Telangana they fielded candidates only in six seats, Mr. Owaisi said all parties which have “falling political graph think to stay relevant by criticising him”. In Telangana it was AIMIM’s election strategy to field candidates only in eight seats, he explained. He criticised UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for coming to Hyderabad for an election campaign even as a police officer was killed following allegations of cow slaughter. “The accused in the case are Bajrang Dal activists. Now it is up to BJP to decide whether they want to act against Bajrang Dal which is a sister concern of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,” Mr. Owaisi said. He further stated that both BJP and Congress should be voted out of power."

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Bombay High Court on Wednesday reserved its order on a plea seeking deletion of a chapter from school textbooks that refers to the leader of Khalistani movement, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, as a ‘terrorist.’Advocate Amritpal Singh Khalsa filed the petition in 2017 stating that there was no material, no FIR, no chargesheet and no conviction against Bhindranwale and all of these had been known in an RTI petition. Mr. Khalsa said, “If one wants to portray Bhindranwale to be a terrorist then one should show how many people died in Operation Blue Star and Delhi riots.” He urged the court to pass a direction to the State so that the chapter could be removed. Senior counsel V.A. Thorat, appearing for the State, told the court that textbook preparations undergo a thorough process and they had already been printed twice.He said that if the State wanted to make any changes on its own then it was different but the court should not give any direction on this."

As the French state tries to withdraw, it faces an unprecedented backlash ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The sight of flaming barricades and upturned cars in Paris usually sends journalists scurrying to their cliché cupboard. For historically literate commentators, current events in France evoke the storming of the Bastille and the Paris Commune. For the politically minded, they seem more akin to the Popular Front of 1936 or May 1968. And, for those aware of France’s difficult colonial past, the spectacle of the police confronting ordinary citizens brings back memories of the Battle of Algiers.Historical parallelsThere is a kernel of truth to all these clichés. It is true that political violence in France follows well-worn patterns that have their roots in the country’s revolutionary past. This means that the mere erection of a barricade can turn a tedious protest march into a pseudo-revolutionary action with powerful political ramifications.It is also true that some of the techniques used in the recent protests in France mirror those used by trade unions. Shutdowns and blockades have been the stock-in-trade of the French labour movement for more than 150 years.Also ReadThe Hindu explains: Why are riots happening in France?And, yes, after the collapse of the French empire in the 1950s and 1960s, the French police did bring their peculiarly violent methods of control and interrogation back to metropolitan France, with sometimes devastating consequences.The problem is that none of these clichés really gets to the heart of the so-calledgilets jaunes(yellow vest) protests that have rocked France for the past three weeks. This is because the protests do not fit the usual historic parallels.For a start, thegilets jaunesmovement is not led by any union or political party. No one can say that it is a structured ‘movement’. It also seems to combine elements of the right and left — and especially elements of the far-right and far-left — that make an ideological interpretation of the protests awkward.Most importantly, the protesters’ demands are not clearly articulated: some want tax cuts (on fuel), some want tax rises (for the rich), some want more public services, some want more generous state benefits, some want to smash up symbols of capitalism, some want a stronger President, some think the current President is too strong, and some want all of these things at once.Given this extraordinary dispersion of demands, it is hard to give a fixed reading of what thegilets jaunesrepresent. Instead, it is more useful to focus on the few things that unite them. There are two that stand out.Double-bind of French stateThe first is the obsessive focus on the French state. From the beginning, thegilets jauneshave targeted the French state as both villain and saviour. They have organised groups to protest outside government offices all over the country, especially in smaller provincial towns. This has frequently been accompanied by violence and vandalism. Almost all of the protesters agree that the state is not doing enough and has neglected their needs.This belief has been exacerbated by the imperious attitude of French President Emmanuel Macron. His avowedly statist orientation, his embrace of the hyper-presidentialism of the Fifth Republic, and his fondness for monarchical symbolism have merely stoked the fire. Like an ill-fated king, Mr. Macron has turned anger at the state into anger at his person.Yet, despite their ire, thegilets jaunesalso demand redress from the very same state they abhor. They want the French government to lower fuel taxes, reinstate rural post offices, increase their ‘purchasing power’, cut property taxes, and hire more doctors for rural clinics. They firmly believe that the state can and should fix their problems. The fact that many of the issues at the heart of the protests relate to deep structural imbalances in the French economy makes no difference. The state is held as sole responsible and sole guarantor.This paradox has a long pedigree in French history. Especially since 1945, the French state has expanded enormously, to a point that French people are comfortable with high levels of state interference in their social and economic lives. The massive subsidies put in place to soften the blow of deindustrialisation in the 1980s further increased this dependence.Today’s demonstrations are a logical outcome of this double-bind: as the French state tries to withdraw, under pressure from European Union-wide austerity politics and its own budgetary overreach, it faces an unprecedented backlash.Centre and peripheryThe second common theme in thegilets jaunesprotests is their very wide geographical dispersion. In this respect, the focus on Paris has been misleading. What is most interesting about recent events is how spread out they are across metropolitan France and even overseas.While cars were burning on the Champs-Elysées, thousands of people in provincial France blocked roundabouts, staged sit-ins on town squares, and threw rocks at town halls. Meanwhile, in the overseas territory of La Réunion in the Indian Ocean, the entire island has been brought to a standstill by targeted traffic blockades.This geographical reach reflects another long-standing structural pathology of the French economy, namely the sharp division between centre and periphery. While urban areas in France have tended to develop better infrastructure and more integrated community structures, the withdrawal of state aid has had the opposite effect in peri-urban and rural areas, and in the highly unequal overseas territories.In this respect, it is significant that the catalyst for the protests was rising fuel prices. Those most reliant on their cars are those who live farthest from urban areas and do not have access to regular public transport. In addition, there has been a complete policy reversal on diesel fuel. After almost half a century of subsidies, the French state has been taking away financial incentives on diesel since the early 2000s. This is a heavy blow for the 61% of French people whose cars run on diesel, and for the truckers and farmers who were used to getting their fuel on the cheap.A bleak futureSo what can be done? The answer is, probably not much. The most likely scenario is that the protests will peter out due to fatigue, demobilisation and a lack of leadership. It is not clear how, if at all, any political party can capitalise on them, except perhaps for the far-right politician Marine Le Pen, who sees herself as the voice for France’s peripheral squeezed middle.The biggest danger is spiralling depoliticisation. Mr. Macron’s plunging approval ratings before and during thegilets jaunesprotests indicates a crisis of leadership at least as acute as the one that marred former President François Hollande’s five years in office. Not for the first time, the most urgent task facing France’s elite is to elaborate a more inclusive political project that will begin to reduce the country’s well-documented inequalities.Emile Chabal is a Reader in History at the University of Edinburgh and the author of ‘A Divided Republic: Nation, State and Citizenship in Contemporary France’"

Only regional parties can represent the aspirations of the people of Telangana, says MIM chief
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Referring to AIMIM as BJP’s C-team reveals the feudal mindset of Rahul Gandhi, said AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday. Mr. Owaisi was responding to questions at a media conference held at Hyderabad Press Club.“Rahul Gandhi is a Janeudhari Hindu. A Janeudhari Hindu thinks everyone is lesser than him. But the Indian Constitution considers everyone equal,” Mr. Owaisi said. Congress party is losing in elections because of Rahul Gandhi, he slammed. “We need regional parties to represent aspirations of Telangana,” he said, adding TDP and Congress rule brought no development in the region.Mr. Owaisi made an open appeal to the electorate to bring K. Chandrasekhar back to power. Muslim community in Telangana is aware that communal riots have not broken out in Hyderabad after TRS came to power, he said.Brushing aside allegations that AIMIM contested in several seats in other States including Uttar Pradesh to split votes in favour of BJP even as in Telangana they fielded candidates only in six seats, Mr. Owaisi said all parties which have “falling political graph think to stay relevant by criticising him”. In Telangana it was AIMIM’s election strategy to field candidates only in eight seats, he explained. He criticised Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath for coming to Hyderabad for an election campaign even as a police officer was killed following allegations of cow slaughter.‘Prevent name change’Mr. Owaisi on Wednesday urged the people to vote for his party to prevent Hyderabad from being renamed.Speaking at a public meeting near Khilwat ground in the Charminar Assembly segment and flanked by party leaders, he said, “When you leave to cast your vote, remember that to save the name Hyder in Hyderabad, vote for the Majlis.”Correlating ‘Hyder Karrar’, a reverential reference to Prophet Muhammad’s cousin Hazrat Ali, to Hyderabad, Mr Owaisi said that irrespective of religious denomination and faith, the city is synonymous with brave people."

N.S. Madhavan, author of ‘Thiruth’, is hopeful of the return of a vibrant media
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“If the Babri Masjid demolition happened today, Chulliat would most likely take to Twitter to set the record straight,” says writer N.S. Madhavan, an astute observer of politics and history.Twenty-five years after he created Chulliat – a slothful, indifferent editor of a daily who turns an unlikely hero with a singular correction of ‘disputed structure’ into ‘Babri Masjid’ – in his story,Thiruth(Blue Pencilin translation), Mr. Madhavan believes that very few dailies have retained the power of headline.Thiruth,first published in 1993, became an instant rage. Mr. Madhavan dubs Chulliat a Nehruvian-era editor who had imbibed the spirit of resistance.‘Complex scenario’Much water has flowed along the ‘news stream’ since the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, 1992.“There has been an enormous inflow of finance capital in media worldwide. Things like cross-media ownership have given them the power to manufacture opinion, even swing the elections. It’s a complex scenario where the time-tested role of media as a source of information has taken the backseat. Structural changes within media houses further accentuated the change.It’s made worse, with the government frowning upon dissent. There’s a clear attempt to muzzle free opinion when independent news sites are bombarded with defamation suits,” says Mr. Madhavan, who had worked as a journalist in Lucknow before his selection to the IAS.But he has a lasting faith in the discerning ability of the reader/listener. In strong democracies like the U.S. where institutions have retained their autonomy, the media have put up a brave defence of freedom.He also sees the advent of portals busting fake news as a sign of latent resilience building up on ground.In his introduction to a collection of his favourite stories, Mr. Madhavan wonders if the history of post-independence India would be marked by communally charged pogroms – the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the post-Babri Masjid demolition riots and the 2002 Gujarat riots prominent among them. His stories illustrate the ‘weight of history physically impacting’ individuals, as sister Agatha, a Malayali nun at a monastery in UP, feels inVanmarangal Veezhumbol(When Big Trees Fall), written on the riots of 1984."

The “yellow vest” protests began on November 17 in opposition to rising fuel taxes, but they have since ballooned into a broad challenge to the government’s pro-business agenda.One of the demands from the protesters, who are mostly from rural or small-town France, is a repeal of Mr. Macron’s move last year to cut the ISF “fortune tax” which was previously levied on high-earners.‘We can change it’“If something isn’t working, we’re not dumb, we’ll change it,” government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said on RTL radio on Wednesday, saying that the wealth tax would be evaluated. Mr. Macron was heckled late on Tuesday as he visited a burned-out government building in central France, hours after a new opinion poll showed his approval rating at just 23%. Mr. Griveaux stressed that reinstating the ISF “is not on the table for now,” but Equality Minister Marlène Schiappa said she would argue to bring it back unless the tax cut could be shown to be effective.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced the first major retreat of Mr. Macron’s presidency when he suspended for six months a rise in fuel taxes scheduled for January 1. A source in the Prime Minister’s office said that “the government has not necessarily played all of its cards”, with more concessions such as a further cut in residence taxes possible."

Following rally to protest trespass of leaders of Hindu outfits into school
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Tension broke out in Pamban in Rameswaram island when a large number of Christians took out a procession and staged a demonstration, demanding the arrest of Hindu Munnani and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) leaders for trespassing into St. Anne’s Matriculation Higher Secondary School and allegedly abusing the Headmistress (HM).About 1,000 people, including members of St. Antony’s Church, staged the protest demanding the arrest of Hindu Munnani district president Ramamurthy and BMS leader Bharathi Raja and others for trespassing into the school on Monday and abusing the HM after she pulled up and sent home some students for not wearing shoes as part of the school uniform.Police said after the HM, a nun, had sent home about 50 students, all but two returned wearing shoes, while two boys came with the BMS leader, who questioned the school authorities for insisting on the boys wearing shoes when they were observing rituals for undertaking pilgrimage to Palani.He then left and returned with Mr. Ramamurthy and his supporters, who carried organisation flags and staged a protest shouting slogans inside the school. Acting on a complaint lodged by the HM, Pamban police registered a first information report against the ‘offenders’ under Sections 147 (rioting), 294 (b) (reciting obscene words), 447 (criminal trespass) and 153 (acts prejudicial to maintenance of religious harmony) of the IPC, the police said.On a counter complaint, the police registered an FIR against the HM under Sections 323 (causing hurt) and 505 (ii) (public mischief) of the IPC and 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. It was against this backdrop, the Christians, led by the Parish priest, hit the road, the police said. They dispersed after the police said they would complete the enquiry in a day and take necessary action.

French government set for tax U-turn to quell “yellow vest” protests
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/french-government-likely-to-suspend-fuel-tax-increases/article25662609.ece,,https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The French government is preparing to suspend fuel tax increases after weeks of violent protests, a government source said on Tuesday, in what would mark a major U-turn by President Emmanuel Macron after 18 months in office.Prime Minister Edouard Philippe was due to announce the suspension later on Tuesday, the source said, although it was unclear whether he would announce a time-limited “moratorium” or abandon the next carbon-tax increase entirely.The so-called “yellow vest” movement, which started on Nov. 17 as a social-media-organised protest group named for the high-visibility jackets all motorists in France must have in their cars, has focused on denouncing a squeeze on household spending brought about by Mr. Macron's taxes on fuel.The president said the taxes are needed to combat climate change. Ditching them could be a major embarrassment as governments meet in Poland to try to pin down measures to avert the most damaging consequences of global warming.Also ReadThe Hindu explains: Why are riots happening in France?However, over the past three weeks the protests have evolved into a wider anti-Macron uprising, with many criticising the president for pursuing policies they say favour the rich and do nothing to help the working poor.Despite mostly peaceful nationwide demonstrations, the protests have turned violent on successive weekends in Paris. On Saturday, the Arc de Triomphe national monument was defaced and avenues off the Champs Elysees were damaged. Cars, buildings and some cafes were torched.The unrest is estimated to have cost the economy millions, with large-scale disruption to retailers, wholesalers, the restaurant and hotel trades. In some areas, manufacturing has been hit in the run up to Christmas.Senior members of Mr. Macron's La Republique En Marche party said the government could also increase the minimum wage from January along with other measures to deliver a quick boost low-income households, although the details remained unclear.The government's decision to push ahead with an increase in fuel taxes from January, part of a longer-term effort to discourage fossil fuel use, angered people in rural or outer urban areas who use their cars more.It was not immediately clear if suspending the tax rise would be enough to placate the “yellow vests” or head off a repeat of the violence that erupted in Paris on Saturday, which officials said was driven by extreme groups on the far-left and far-right, such as the Black bloc and anarchist factions.The U-turn could also undermine Mr. Macron's credentials as a ”new style” president willing to shake up France.He has said repeatedly that he will not back down but with his ratings barely above 20 percent and with other major changes in the pipeline, including pensions reform, party officials say he needs to find a way of cooling the turbulent atmosphere.He is also aware that the anti-establishment fervour spurring the yellow vests on could spell trouble in next year's European election.Mr. Macron has described that election as a battle between progressives like himself and populists on the far-right and the far-left, who have made recent gains in the polls on the back of the popular discontent."

The Hindu explains: Why are riots happening in France?
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-hindu-explains-why-are-riots-happening-in-france/article25662088.ece,"
Over the course of the past two weeks, France has been mired in the worst riots it has seen in the past decade.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Over 400 people have been arrested, hundreds injured, and numerous cars and buildings have been set on fire by protesters. Iconic sites and statues, including the war memorial at the top of the famous Champs Elysees avenue, have been vandalised.At least three people have died as a result of the riots, according toAFP. There have beentalks of imposing a state of emergencyif the situation does not improve.How did this happen?The trigger to the unrest, which began on November 17, was the 'eco-tax', a fuel tax hike imposed with the intention of cutting carbon emission to help transition the country into a low-emission economy. However, as word spread on social media, the protests grew to accommodate those unhappy with President Emmanuel Macron’s economic reforms and the high cost of living. The activists, dressed in yellow vests (referred to as “gilets jaunes”) took to the streets to voice their displeasure. The yellow vests get their name from the high-visibility jackets all motorists in France are obliged to carry with them.Things soon spiraled out of control as numbers swelled and protesters turned violent, taking the police by surprise. The angry mob threw projectiles at riot officers, burned cars and smashed shop fronts. They also defaced the facade of the towering 19th-century Arc de Triomphe with the message: “The yellow vests will triumph.”Where are the protests?The bulk of the riots are concentrated in Paris, but it is also spread across cities and towns in France — from Charleville Mezieres in the northeast to Marseille in the south. Riviera city in Nice, the town of Puy-en-Velay are among the places affected. Since the movement depends on social media to spread the word, protests are cropping up in numerous small towns which have been hit hard by the hike as they are already lacking in public amenities and depend on personal vehicles for transportation.The protests are expected to continue every weekend, which is especially worrying since December is a busy month in Paris with  tourists and Christmas shoppers visiting in large numbers.What is the government doing about it?President Emmanuel Macron had called crisis meetings to contain the situation, and has decided to engage with anti-government activists. However, since this is a grass root movement, there is little clarity as to who the leaders are and how the negotiations should proceed. According toAFP, Environment Minister Francois de Rugy met representatives of the “yellow vest” protesters last week but failed to convince them to end the demonstrations.Meanwhile, Jacline Mouraud, one of the protest movement's prime instigators over social media forums, toldAFPthat scrapping the fuel tax was a “prerequisite for any discussion” with the government, a point which the government is unwilling to negotiate.“We have said that we won't change course. Because the course is good,” a government spokesperson said to BFM television. President Macron too insists that the taxes are necessary to fund France's transition to a low-emission economy and effectively  combat climate change."

French govt. to hold talks with main parties, protest leaders

People are not seeking just development but “development plus”, he added. “We are confident of doing better than the last time in the upcoming parliamentary election and retain power,” he said during the STEP Conclave at the Visvesvaraya Technological University.He began his speech saying that politics was not charity and that his party was after power. “It is needed to change the lives of the people. There need not be any confusion in it,” he said.The BJP aims to come to power from panchayats to Parliament. “We have held the reins over the country, including in six among the seven States in the North East. Very soon, Mizoram will also fall into the BJP fold,” he asserted.“Unlike other parties who claim to serve the people, we are into politics to come to power and not to be seated in the Opposition benches,” he said.“We are after power for the larger objective of bringing in accountability in public life, probity and cleanliness,” he said and criticised the Congress for promoting dynastic politics.He said that the BJP was not afflicted by this menace. “If the son of any politician in the party was into active politics, it was out of his own making and that was welcome,” he said. “You cannot end corruption until people at the top became non-corrupt. Holding a clerk accountable for corrupt practices and not holding accountable a legislator sitting in the Vidhana Soudha for the such practices would not serve the purpose,” he said.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not only not corrupt but also incorruptible. He has set a bench mark for his successors,” he said..He played down the GDP as an index of prosperity. “Things like GDP are mere figures but what matters actually is prosperity. That has been delivered by the government,” he said.According to him, tripling of the income of 100 rich people in the State could change the GDP figures. But what is important is prosperity of the common man.“Now, terrorists and Maoists are on the run and we would not rest until the last terror element is neutralised. Even urban Maoists who disturb peace and tranquillity are under the radar of the law enforcing authorities and they would be sent to jail,” he said.The country was communal-riots free during the last four years, he said."

Singh, for Ms. Jafri, countered that she was about 80 years of age and Ms. Setalvad would be able to assist her in the case.Mr. Singh submitted that SIT had given a clean chit in its closure report before a trial judge.The Magistrate had dismissed Ms. Jafri’s protests to the clean chit without going into the merits.On February 8, 2012, the SIT had filed a closure report, giving clean chit to Mr. Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was “no prosecutable evidence” against them."

Paramedics are complaining about changes to working conditions.It was the latest protest action that President Emmanuel Macron’s government has faced in recent weeks. The “yellow vest” movement is bringing together people from across the political spectrum complaining about France’s economic inequalities and waning spending power.Mr. Macron, just back from the Group of 20 summit in Argentina, held an emergency meeting Sunday on security and the government hasn’t ruled out the possibility of imposing a state of emergency.Nation's worst unrestOn December 1, more than 130 people were injured and 412 arrested on Saturday in the French capital amid one of the nation’s worst unrest in recent times. Police responded with tear gas and water cannons, closing down dozens of streets and subway stations to contain the riot.The rioting was the third straight weekend of clashes in Paris led by protesters wearing distinctive yellow traffic vests. The protests began last month with motorists upset over a fuel tax hike and have grown to encompass a range of complaints that Mr. Macron’s government doesn’t care about the problems of ordinary people. Other protests in France remained peaceful.Ambulance workers block the bridge leading the National Assembly, background, in Paris on Dec. 3, 2018.

One activist held up a sign reading “The State killed me” and others chanted “Mr. Macron resign!”According to French media reports, students also joined the protest movement by blocking dozens of high schools across France, while clashes between protesters and police officers reignited on Monday on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, where demonstrations have been particularly violent in recent weeks.Handling the crisisPrime Minister Edouard Philippe and Mr. Macron have been lambasted for their handling of the crisis. After meeting with the Prime Minister, Socialist leader Olivier Faure urged Mr. Philippe to drop the tax hikes and to restore a wealth tax that was slashed by the centrist government.“We want a change in the method. One needs to come down from Mount Olympus,” Mr. Faure said, referring to Mr. Macron’s Greek god nickname of Jupiter.Laurent Wauquiez, head of center-right Les Republicains party, urged Mr. Macron to hold a referendum to end the crisis but didn’t say what its topic should be.“French people need to be heard again, and for that we must organise a referendum to decide these issues. Only these measures will restore calm,” Mr. Wauquiez said.Since the movement kicked off on Nov. 17, three people have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes or accidents stemming from the protests. Over the past three weeks, protesters have been setting up road blockades across the country and their movement has garnered wide public support.Mr. Philippe will try to defuse tensions this week before more possible protests this weekend, speaking with yellow vest representatives on December 4. Members of the National Assembly will also hold talks on France’s social crisis later this week. Meanwhile, trade union CGT has called for a day of protest across France on Dec. 14."

Bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi makes its intention clear that it will hear the PILs that have been pending for years in the court.
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court on December 3 gave the Gujarat government an opportunity to file an affidavit giving reasons why an apex court-appointed committee’s report on 22 ‘fake’ police encounters, which occurred during Narendra Modi’s Chief Ministership between 2002 and 2006, should not be made available to petitioners seeking a fair and independent probe into the ‘killings’.A Bench, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI)  Ranjan Gogoi made its intention clear that it would hear the PILs, which have been pending for years in the court, adjourned from date to date.“We have to get to this... when do we do it?” the CJI addressed the lawyers with the petition in hand, referring to the case’s long pendency in court.Advocates Prashant Bhushan and Nitya Ramakrishnan, for petitioners B.G. Verghese and lyricist Javed Akhtar, said the committee appointed by the court and led by its former judge, Justice H.S. Bedi, had filed a report in the court earlier this year after the completion of its inquiry into the “encounter”.“Report copy needs to be supplied,” Mr. Bhushan addressed the Bench, also comprising Justices S.K. Kaul and K.M. Joseph.At this point, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta intervened, saying a copy of the report should not be shared immediately. He said he had “something responsible to say.”“Ok, say it,” the CJI told him. But Mr. Mehta said he would prefer to put it down in an affidavit.Also ReadSC posts Zakia Jafri plea for JanuaryIn its order, the court recorded Mr. Mehta ’s objection, saying, “The Solicitor-General wants to submit an affidavit before the court about making available the inquiry report.”The court stood firm and posted the next hearing on December 12 though Mr. Mehta urged it to list the case after the winter vacations in January.In 2012, Justice Bedi replaced Justice M.B. Shah as the committee’s chairperson. The petitions had sought independent investigations by CBI/SIT, alleging fake encounters and a cover-up of killings in cold blood.Even then the court had noted that the case has been “pending for years without any substantive orders passed.” It asked the committee to “look into all these cases thoroughly so that the truth is revealed.”In his petition filed in 2007 in the Supreme Court, Mr. Verghese raised suspicions about the encounter deaths between 2003 and 2006. He produced on record before the court the very list that the Gujarat government had furnished to the Legislative Assembly on the details of the encounters.List spanned a range of personsThe list, he had alleged, showed that the encounter killings spanned a range of persons that included workmen who had come in from outside the State to suspected terrorists. The ages of those killed ranged from 22 to 37. It was not clear if the families of those killed were even aware of the fate of these young persons.“There is need to investigate this pattern and there must be a system in place to ensure that armed personnel do not easily do away with lives of citizens,” he had submitted.Mr. Akhtar had highlighted a case involving the killing of one Sameer Khan and alleged that in all these cases the police version was invariably that the victims were terrorists from Jaish-e-Mohammed on a mission to assassinate Mr. Modi.The court had then made it clear that the cases did not include those already under investigation by the CBI or SIT as per the Supreme Court or High Court orders. This would mean the Sohrabuddin-Kauser Bi, Tulsiram Prajapati and Ishrat Jahan cases were outside purview."

WhatsApp chief writes to RBI, seeks nod to expand payment services to all users ",https://www.thehindu.com/business/whatsapp-chief-writes-to-rbi-seeks-nod-to-expand-payment-services-to-all-users/article25647395.ece,"
The development comes at a time when competitors such as Google have forged ahead with their payments offerings. ",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"WhatsApp Chief has written to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), seeking a formal nod to expand payments services to all its 200 million users in India.The messaging app, which has drawn fire from the government over spread of fake messages on its platform, continues to wait for a regulatory clearance to launch full-fledged payments operations in India, months after its ‘testing’ amassed nearly one million users, and almost two years since it first began discussions with the government on its payments services plans.The development comes at a time when competitors such as Google have forged ahead with their payments offerings.WhatsApp is currently piloting WhatsApp payments, and its Chief Chris Daniels has now written to the RBI urging that a formal approval be granted to take the payments product to all its users in the country.“I write to request your formal approval to immediately expand WhatsApp’s BHIM UPI (Unified Payments Interface) compliant payments product to all users in India, giving us the opportunity to offer a useful and secure service that can improve the lives of Indian people through digital empowerment and financial inclusion,” Daniels said in the letter addressed to the RBI Governor.The letter, dated November 5, mentions that WhatsApp’s partner banks have also submitted a request for formal approval.When contacted, a WhatsApp spokesperson said the platform is working closely with the Indian government, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), and multiple banks, including payment service providers to expand the feature to more people and support the country’s digital economy.“Today, almost 1 million people are testing WhatsApp payments in India. The feedback has been very positive, and people enjoy the convenience of sending money as simply and securely as sending messages,” the company’s spokesperson said, responding to a specific email query on the recent plea to the RBI.In the letter, WhatsApp noted that the platform had rushed to ensure that the payments data is stored in India, immediately after the RBI came out with a directive outlining the new payments data storage requirements in April this year.“Today, (the) RBI has unfettered supervisory access to payments data as prescribed by the RBI circular , said the letter. PTI has seen a copy of the letter.The Facebook-owned company has also demanded a “level playing field” for all companies that offer payment services, including “a certain and transparent regulatory and operating environment“.WhatsApp has also made a case for scaling up its operations by citing the productivity gains that have accrued to Indian small business as a result of the digital tool, and expressed its deep commitment to the market.“Based on feedback from NPCI and our bank partners, we are confident that we are fully compliant with the UPI checklist, have made all necessary submissions and have passed the security audits required to launch WhatsApp Payments,” Daniels said.It could not be immediately ascertained if the firm has received any response from the RBI to its letter.WhatsApp’s ambitious payment services’ blueprint has been caught in a bind, over concerns around authentication and its data storage practices. In the past, its home grown rivals have alleged that WhatsApp’s payment platform has security risks for consumers and is not in compliance with the guidelines.WhatsApp has been under tremendous pressure to put in place a mechanism to curb fake news on its messaging platform that incited mob fury in India. Over a dozen people have been killed across the country this year in mob lynchings, fuelled by rumours circulating on WhatsApp.The rumours ranged from suspicion of stealing children to victims being believed to be killing cows. Riots have been instigated by people forwarding and misinterpreting videos on WhatsApp.The government has, on several occasions, warned the company that it can’t evade responsibility if its messaging service is used to spread false information. The Centre has directed WhatsApp to develop tools to combat fake or false messages, and, more importantly, to identify message originators.Apart from the traceability request, the government had asked WhatsApp to set up a local corporate presence and appoint a grievance officer to address complaints.WhatsApp recently named a grievance officer for India, and announced the appointment of an India head — the first for the country that accounts for most users across the world. It also launched a label that identifies forwarded messages, and barred forwarding of messages to more than five people at one go."

",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"The Supreme Court on Monday said it wants to see the chargesheet filed by the Maharashtra government against lawyer Surendra Gadling and others accused of Maoist links in the aftermath of the Bhima-Koregaon violence to see “how serious” the charges against them are.The decision by a Bench of Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, Justices S.K. Kaul and K.M. Joseph to call for the chargesheet came after the State objected to grant of bail to the accused, claiming the charges were too serious for such a relief.The court asked the State to file the chargesheet and the gist of the case before December 11, the next date of hearing.HC orderThe State had approached the Supreme Court against a Bombay High Court order rejecting the Maharashtra police plea for a 90-day extension to complete its investigation and file a chargesheet against Mr. Gadling and others.The court had recently stayed the October 24 High Court, which had opened the window for Mr. Gadling, Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen, activists Sudhir Dhawale and Mahesh Raut and Rona Wilson to seek default bail.They were arrested on June 6 by the Pune police and a case was registered against them under various provisions of The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and the Indian Penal Code.The State’s petition has argued that under Section 43-D (2) of the UAPA Act, the trial court may, on the report of the public prosecutor, extend the detention of the accused for another 90 days.‘Pedantic view’On September 2, the trial court had allowed an extension of 90 days, following which Mr. Gadling and the others moved the High Court, which set aside the trial court order. The High Court, however, stayed its order till November 1 to give the State time to appeal to the Supreme Court.The State government argued that the High Court resorted to a “pedantic view rather than resorting to a pragmatic view.” The High Court concluded that the report backing the plea for a 90-day extension of detention was filed before the Sessions Judge by the case investigating officer instead of the public prosecutor as required by law."

Congress criticised for promoting dynastic politics

BJP is seeking power for the larger objective of bringing in accountability in public life and probity, says Ram Madhav
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"“We will come back to power in the next Lok Sabha elections, as people are happy with our performance,” BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav said in Belagavi on Sunday.The people are expecting “development plus”. People are not seeking just development but “development plus”, he added. “We are confident of doing better than the last time in the upcoming parliamentary election and retain power,” he said during the STEP Conclave at the Visvesvaraya Technological University.He began his speech saying that politics was not charity and that his party was after power. “It is needed to change the lives of the people. There need not be any confusion in it,” he said.The BJP aims to come to power from panchayats to Parliament. “We have held the reins over the country, including in six among the seven States in the North East. Very soon, Mizoram will also fall into the BJP fold,” he asserted.“Unlike other parties who claim to serve the people, we are into politics to come to power and not to be seated in the Opposition benches,” he said.“We are after power for the larger objective of bringing in accountability in public life, probity and cleanliness,” he said and criticised the Congress for promoting dynastic politics.He said that the BJP was not afflicted by this menace. “If the son of any politician in the party was into active politics, it was out of his own making and that was welcome,” he said. “You cannot end corruption until people at the top became non-corrupt. Holding a clerk accountable for corrupt practices and not holding accountable a legislator sitting in the Vidhana Soudha for the such practices would not serve the purpose,” he said.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not only not corrupt but also incorruptible. He has set a bench mark for his successors,” he said..He played down the GDP as an index of prosperity. “Things like GDP are mere figures but what matters actually is prosperity. That has been delivered by the government,” he said.According to him, tripling of the income of 100 rich people in the State could change the GDP figures. But what is important is prosperity of the common man.“Now, terrorists and Maoists are on the run and we would not rest until the last terror element is neutralised. Even urban Maoists who disturb peace and tranquillity are under the radar of the law enforcing authorities and they would be sent to jail,” he said.The country was communal-riots free during the last four years, he said."

France to consider state of emergency to prevent riots recurring

When asked about imposing a state of emergency, Mr. Griveaux said it would be among the options considered .
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"France will consider imposing a state of emergency to prevent a recurrence of some of the worst civil unrest in more than a decade and urged peaceful protesters to come to the negotiating table, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said on Sunday.Groups of young men with faces masked, some carrying metal bars and axes, rioted on the streets of central Paris on Saturday, setting a dozen vehicles ablaze and torching buildings. “We have to think about the measures that can be taken so that these incidents don't happen again,” Mr. Griveaux told Europe 1 radio.The authorities were caught off guard by the escalation in violence after two weeks of nationwide protests against fuel taxes and living costs, known as the “yellow vest” movement after fluorescent jackets kept in all vehicles in France.President Emmanuel Macron will hold an emergency meeting with the Prime Minister and interior minister later on Sunday to discuss the riots and how to begin a dialogue with the protest movement, which has no real structure or leadership.When asked about imposing a state of emergency, Mr. Griveaux said it would be among the options considered on Sunday. “It is out of the question that each weekend becomes a meeting or ritual for violence.”Protests began on Nov. 17 and quickly grew thanks to social media, with protesters blocking roads across France and impeding access to shopping malls, factories and some fuel depots. Authorities said violent groups from the far right and far left as well as “thugs” from the suburbs had infiltrated the yellow vests movement in Paris on Saturday, although Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said most of those arrested were regular protesters who had been egged on by fringe groups.Speaking on BFM TV late on Saturday, Mr. Castaner said the authorities had put all security measures in place to prevent the violence, but that they had faced extremely violent, organised and determined groups. He did however say the government had made a mistake in how it communicated its plans to move away from oil dependence, the policy which led to fuel tax hikes.He and Mr. Griveaux urged the yellow vest movement to organise itself and coming to the negotiating table. “We are ready to talk to them everywhere and the door is open to them,” Griveaux said. Paul Marra, a yellow vest activist in Marseille, toldBFM TVthat the government was to blame for the violence across the country.“We condemn what happened, but it was inevitable. The violence started from the top. The biggest thug is the state through its inaction.”"

At that time, the current police chief Loknath Behera was one of the top officers of the National Investigation Agency. He had prepared a report exonerating Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah in the Ishrat Jehan encounter case,” Mr. Ramachandran said.Ishrat Jahan, 19, from Mumbai and Javed Shaikh, alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjadali Akbarali Rana and Zeeshan Johar were killed by a joint team of the police and officials of the Intelligence Bureau in an encounter in 2004 on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.Police claimLater, the police claimed that they were associated with the Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba and were plotting to kill Mr. Modi, who was the Chief Minister of Gujarat then.Mr. Ramachandran also claimed that he had a come across files related to the case. “As a thanksgiving gesture, Mr. Modi asked his ‘friend’ Pinarayi Vijayan, who had just assumed charge as the Kerala Chief Minister, to give him the top post in the State police force. Mr. Vijayan agreed and that was the first decision of the new [Left Democratic Front] government,” Mr. Ramachandran alleged.D.G. Vanzara, a former police official and an accused in the case, recently claimed that Mr. Narendra Modi was secretly interrogated by the investigating agency."

Macron chairs Paris crisis meeting
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/macron-chairs-paris-crisis-meeting/article25650647.ece,"
No cause justifies violence, says President; workers clean up the mess caused by protests in capital
",,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday surveyed the damage from a day of riots across Paris and led a crisis meeting that ended with a call for further talks with anti-government activists who have staged two weeks of protests.Mr. Macron held crisis talks with the Prime Minister, Interior Minister and top security service officials to forge a response to the violence that left hundreds injured nationwide. Prime Minister Édouard Philippe has been asked to meet protest organisers and party leaders as part of a “constant wish for dialogue”, the Élysée Palace said. Environment Minister François de Rugy met representatives of the “yellow vests” last week but failed to convince them to end the protests.Assessing the damageThe government has not ruled out imposing a state of emergency to combat the protests, which began over fuel taxes but have grown into wider anger over Mr. Macron’s agenda. The President earlier assessed the damage at the Arc de Triomphe, the massive monument to France’s war dead at the top of the famous Champs Élysées avenue, where rioters scrawled graffiti and ransacked the ticketing and reception areas. Inside, rioters smashed in the iconic face of a sculpture, a partial reproduction of the victory allegory “La Marseillaise” by François Rude.Mr. Macron also saw the wreckage of burnt-out cars and damaged buildings from rioting at other sites, where he praised the police but was also booed by sections of the crowd. Police said 412 people were arrested on Saturday during the worst clashes for years in the capital and 378 remained in custody.A total of 263 people were injured nationwide, with 133 injured in the capital, including 23 members of the security forces. “I will never accept violence,” Mr. Macron said. “No cause justifies that authorities are attacked, that businesses are plundered, that passers-by or journalists are threatened or that the Arc du Triomphe is defiled.”Overnight, a motorist died after crashing a van into traffic which had built up due to a “yellow vest” demo in Arles, southern France, a local prosecutor said Sunday. Three people have now died in incidents linked to the protests.The anti-government protests that have swept France were sparked initially by a rise in taxes on diesel.In Paris on Sunday, as groups of workers set about cleaning up the mess from the previous day, the scale of the destruction became clear. Nearly 190 fires were put out and six buildings were set alight, said the Interior Ministry.At the Arc de Triomphe, graffiti had been daubed, with one slogan saying: “The yellow vests will win.”Broad opposition frontOver the last few weeks, the “yellow vest” movement has morphed into a broad opposition front to Mr. Macron, 40. Violent anarchist and far-right groups have infiltrated it and are thought to be behind Saturday’s clashes.Mr. Macron faces a dilemma in how to respond, not least because the “yellow vests” are a grass-roots movement with no formal leaders and a wide range of demands. He has so far refused to roll back taxes on fuel, which he says are needed to fund the country’s transition to a low-emission economy. And he remains a fervent defender of the tax cuts he has delivered for businesses and the wealthy, which he believes were necessary to lower chronic high unemployment."

But others mixed in with them wore black hoodies and piled up construction materials, including large plywood planks, in the middle of a street near the Arc de Triomphe, and set the rubble on fire.Police responded by firing bursts from a water cannon with backup from riot officers, who used tear gas on the protesters.In addition to rising taxes, demonstrators are furious about President Emmanuel Macron’s leadership. A demonstration last weekend in Paris also turned violent.Earlier Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at the top of the Champs-Elysees on Saturday morning. Access to the avenue was closed to cars and strictly monitored by police with identity checks and bag inspections. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds as some tried to force their way through.The protests, which began with motorists demonstrating against a fuel tax hike, now involve a broad range of demands related to the country’s high cost of living.Shopkeepers on the Champs-Elysees prepared for possible new violence, bringing in workers to barricade boutique windows with boards. Decorative iron grates, used last week in barricades, were removed from around trees and outdoor terraces dismantled.All subway stations in and around the famous avenue were closed for security reasons, Paris public transport company RATP said.Last week, French authorities said 8,000 people demonstrated on the Champs-Elysees avenue. Some of the protesters torched barriers and plywood boards. Police fired tear gas and water cannons to push back angry demonstrators.Since the protests kicked off Nov. 17, two people were killed and hundreds injured in accidents stemming from the protests since they kicked off Nov. 17, and hundreds of protesters and police have been injured.Meanwhile, hundreds of roads blockades were also held quietly across the country."

Teja Lele Desai gives us 11 tips for a quick and easy home re-do
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"If you groom and style yourself as the season turns, doesn’t your home, your haven, deserve a stylingsession too? We let you in on 11 décor secrets that every stylist worth his or her salt knows but won’t tell you.#1 The statement pieceThere’s no need for a multitude of things in every room. It only results in the eye going all over and finding no focus. Just one statement-making piece does the trick.#2 Scale with heightUse artefacts and accessories of varying heights to create a sense of scale and proportion. A statuesque floor lamp, a vase with overhanging branches or a small sculpture on a table can create a new look.#3 Get some traysEvery table or counter has things that seem to run away from you —cosmetics in the bathroom, remotes on the coffee table and odds and ends in the entryway. Keep things together by putting them all in a stylish tray.#4 Tea towel talesApart from drying-up duties, a tea towel may be used for various odd jobs in the kitchen — to spread over cooked food, cover a tea tray or mop up a mess. Pick up good looking ones and use them to add style to the kitchen.#5 Mixed throw pillowsThe throw pillows on your couch should never be the same size. Mix them up when it comes to shapes, sizes and textures to add colour and depth to your sofa styling. Odd numbers tend to look better than even.#6 The Rule of 3There’s a reason why the third rule is the adhered to by designers across the world. When things come in threes — be it photo frames, candles or nesting tables — they tend to look better as a group.#7 Kitchen counterSure you scrub and keep it as clean as you can. But we’re referring to keeping the counter top free. So tuck away as many appliances as you can into the cabinets or wall-mount them. A cleaner counter top gives you the illusion or an airy kitchen.#8 Put out white towelsThey may be a pain to keep clean — yes, we feel it too — but there’s nothing like fresh and fluffy white towels to inject a spa-like feel into your bathroom. But make sure you keep these white babies white.#9 Not too manyInstead of a riot of colours that seems to take you all over the place, do as the stylists do: Select a monochromatic scheme and add pops of colour. This gives you a cleaner look, one that can be changed more often.#10 Add little touchesSimple additions and touches can add more style than big-ticket pieces. A fresh flower in a group of vases, a pretty plant in a brass planter, a comfortable throw placed on the back of the couch — small touches can elevate your styling.#11 Less is moreWhen in doubt, remember that less is always more. If you can’t think of what to do to make your room look better, consider paring it down. Edit, edit,edit."

Will Ayodhya be an issue in the 2019 elections?
",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/will-ayodhya-be-an-issue-in-the-2019-elections/article25628044.ece,"
Elections will be fought on a polarised agenda, but it will not be easy for the BJP
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Whether Ayodhya matters to the electorate or not, it will be made to matter by the BJP-RSS combine and the Vishva Hindu Parishad in the run-up to the 2019 general election. The question is this: what will be the modality of foregrounding the Ayodhya issue in a context that is vastly different from 1992?Ayodhya has been less about faith and more about a muscular Hindu majority that wishes to rule by bringing the Muslims into near-complete submission and denying them their legitimate claim of being equal citizens. The problem, however, for the Hindu Right is that Muslims no longer fit into that imagination of an aggressive or militant opponent; instead, they are a vanquished lot looking for physical safety and basic survival.In search of an enemyMilitant Hindutva mobilisation today is based on the search for an enemy. Muslims have steadily become economically marginalised, socially ghettoised and politically less influential. In fact, in much of the north, Partition witnessed the migration of social elites among the Muslims, leaving behind the economically weaker sections amongst them. Today their plight is far worse than the Dalits and even the Adivasis.In the context of a virulent mobilisation without a palpable enemy, the discourse around the construction of the temple raises the question of the viability of political instrumentality in stoking the issue before every general election and the demand that Hindus prove their faith. It is now about the ‘good Hindu’ and the ‘bad Hindu’. While Muslims face the threat of physical violence, Hindus have to prove their faith in a political arena that is far removed, and in deep tension, with Hinduism’s everyday spiritual and religious dimensions. The heat, therefore, has also turned on the BJP to prove its commitment to the issue outside of its political calculation, and the campaign by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is symptomatic of this. For the BJP and the RSS, if the issue is settled early, it becomes a non-issue for the election, and if they drag it for too long without efforts to actually begin the construction of the temple, there is the danger of the electorate seeing through their game.The reality and the narrativeThis is where the BJP and the RSS have to make the issue matter; the issue no longer has the kind of natural velocity that it carried earlier. This time around, high-pitched emotions have to be constructed; they are perhaps not readily available. It is here that the ability of the BJP and the RSS to construct a reality that matches their narrative will be tested. The ‘reality’ is constructed to suit the narrative through rumours, fake videos, street violence, the use of social media and by engineering riots. The ground for this has been prepared for quite some time and we cannot make sense of it unless we read the issue of Ayodhya, unlike in previous times of the Rath Yatra, not as a standalone issue but one that has the capacity to condense the various elements and narratives floating around. The turn towards a more militant Hindu mobilisation came with the ascendance of the RSS and the paranoid social imaginaries initiated by M.S. Golwalkar. Today that anxiety has been quelled after the massive violence following the Rath Yatra in 1991 and the Gujarat riots of 2002.Whether the Hindu majority cutting across castes will perceive the links between the narratives that are far more complex than a simple-minded narrative of a Muslim adversary is a difficult issue to assess right now. But surely the elections are going to be fought on a polarised agenda. This will be an uphill task for the Hindu Right, however, given that the economy has been sluggish and there are shrinking job opportunities."

‘There is a democratic compulsion for all parties to come together against BJP’
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party’s national president N. Chandrababu Naidu predicted that the next government will be a non-NDA one as “the writing is on the wall” for the current NDA regime.“The nation gave an absolute majority to the Modi government which even Vajpayee could not muster but he has misused the opportunity to the disappointment of the entire nation. The country is under mental duress where people are scared of even using a telephone. There is neither development, nor freedom, nor happiness,” he said, in a media interaction here on Thursday.‘For democracy’Stating that there was a “democratic compulsion” for all parties to come together against BJP, he said it was not a one-man initiative but all parties thinking alike to form an alternative to “save the nation” and its democratic institutions. “We are confident about people believing in us and we have received a good response,” he said.At the same time, Mr. Naidu appeared to have ruled himself out of contention for the top post claiming, “I don’t have any such ambition. I have built Cyberabad here and have to develop Amaravati into a modern global city for which the eco-system will take five to 10 years to develop. People of AP need my attention and my agenda is unfinished there.”Mr. Naidu recalled he had demanded Mr. Modi’s resignation after the Godhra riots and told the then PM Vajpayee to choose between the nation and Gujarat. “I thought he is a changed person and it would have been good for the country but it is possible he (Modi) is holding it against me,” he said. However, he claimed TDP was never ideologically aligned to BJP and it was only a political alliance whereas it has no differences with Congress on ideology. He took the lead to bring various parties together after instances of “personal victimisation, suppression and misuse of ED, CBI, IT” and other institutions began.Pan-India presenceAnd, having noticed that without Congress the goal cannot be achieved, given its pan-India presence, he reached out to Rahul Gandhi and struck a chord with him despite being in opposite side of the fence for 37 years.The AP CM also argued that single party dominated governments resulted in “Hindu rate of growth of 3%” whereas minority govt.s beginning with P.V. Narasimha Rao and subsequent coalition govt.s have done well."

The tragedy is that art has become vocal: A. Ramachandran ",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-tragedy-is-that-art-has-become-vocal-a-ramachandran/article25622612.ece,"
In pursuit of pure art, A. Ramachandran talks about his abiding romance with lotus and how literature informs his craft
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Unlike the densely populated lotus ponds on his canvas, it is easier to navigate A. Ramachandran’s mind. On a balmy November afternoon, the veteran artist turns to his background in literature and music to take one through his distinguished career where he swam against the tide to create an Indian idiom in modern art. We meet at Triveni Kala Sangam where Vadhera Art Gallery is holding an exhibition of his works at the Shridharani Art Gallery. With a walking stick in hand, the 83-year-old took us to the lotus ponds of Ubeshwar, Nagada, Jogi Talab and Ekalinji near Udaipur to explain their changing moods.“I was fascinated by the Bhil tribe and during my journeys to Rajasthan, I discovered these ponds,” informs Ramachandran. “I used to go three or four times a year and spend a week there. I would start in the morning and start sketching. The more I sketched, the more I understood. As an artist, I could see the contour lines – I always use contour lines. When you see the rhythmic lines, you notice the decorative patterns of nature. Nature is more decorative,” he insists as you would discover later. “I used to take a boat. The leaves would give me passage and when I would cross they would close again. It was like mother’s womb, wet, slimy and full of insects. The patches of skyline above made it a visual delight,” exults the Padma Bhushan who learnt his craft at Santiniketan under the watchful eyes of Nandlal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij.Photo: V.V.Krishnan“The way of teaching in Santiniketan was to ask students to go out and sketch. It was not like the British academic system. The student was expected to look outside and start drawing himself without a static model. They wanted students to observe nature and sketch whatever they liked. That practice has stopped but if you can achieve it, you have the freedom to become an artist of your own stature. You need not borrow concepts from somebody else or copy some other artist’s style. This way your work will be your own interpretation of the world.”After studying at Santiniketan, unlike his contemporaries, Ramachandran didn’t go abroad to find his artistic moorings. When he came to Delhi, he started working with contemporaries like Krishen Khanna and Tyeb Mehta and later joined Jamia Millia Islamia as a faculty in Fine Arts department. “After some time, I had a feeling that I have something different and distinct in my genes as a Malayali.” A post graduate in Malayalam literature, Ramachandran was in touch with most of the progressive writers of the language including Vaikom Mohammad Basheer. “They changed the Malayalam literature from a highly Sanskritised form to something that talked about social realism in a colloquial form. In the same way, I felt that if I would paint my realities, the appeal would be universal. You need not follow European trends to show that you are making modern art. Of course, I had used them in my early works when my concerns were more political, but I gradually gave that up. Like pure music, I wanted to do pure painting. Art carries much more authenticity when you handle things which are intimate to you.”Despite the efforts of his teachers, Ramachandran feels that we never really developed the Indian way of teaching art. “We are so overawed by Picasso and Matisse that we are importing ideas and exporting products. Malayalam writers did draw from Maupassant and Flaubert but once they looked around their own life they developed a new idiom. Basheer only wrote about his family and Muslim community in colloquial language. That’s the modernism of Malayalam literature. I am looking for that kind of modernism in Indian art. You not only have to look inward but also be authentic.”Excerpts from a free-wheeling conversation:You were also inspired by the likes of Fyodor Dostoevsky...Yes, but you cannot put Dostoevsky in pictorial form. I had to have something else. Even Dostoevsky had to open the Bible before he wrote ‘Crime and Punishment’ and that lends it a spiritual quality. To me, art is not political journalism, which is very temporary. Today, if you make a painting on Emergency, it carries no weight. Even Partition has been erased out of people’s memory. Such a calamity should have produced great works. Artists like Krishen Khanna and Satish Gujral did create some works but not like what Manto did in literature.So you don’t like socio-political messaging through artworks?Van Gogh didn’t do any political work. His ‘Sunflowers’ is greater than Picasso’s ‘Guernica’. ‘Guernica’ didn’t end any world war. There is still a war going on. It worked because some features of war in it functioned very well in a political way. Hariprasad Chaurasiya doesn’t utter a word but he is a great musician. Music has its own status. Similarly, I feel, painting has its own status. It need not carry message and slogans on the surface. It need not shout at a high pitch. A quiet work can affect you as well.When I watched slaughtering of goats in the Kamakhya temple, I was shocked by human beings turning into animals. Even a child there had tremendous violence on his face. Around the same time, there was the Naxalite Movement where young, bright students were being killed by the State. In that background, I made “Kali Puja” (1972). It was a political statement. But, today, my lotus speaks far better.What does it stand for?It speaks for something greater in life. It shows the world that we have got is so beautiful; it needs to be preserved. When I first visited Udaipur, it was an untouched land. Now after 40 years of my travel, I find it hard to find wild lotus ponds. Many of them have beencleanedup and made into bathing ghats with marble steps.Also, as an artist the more you contemplate in nature, the more you understand that there is another universe where we are superfluous. I cannot explain it in an urban environment. It is a spiritual feeling that you get when you are in nature, looking at not just the lotus but also its leaves, the insects that make them their home, the fungi in the water...we don’t have that kind of perception. We only want to cut flowers.Why did you move away from realism to mythical forms?In 1984, I saw the anti-Sikh riots in front of my eyes. I saw a Sikh person being chased by 20 persons. In Kerala, I had not seen social violence. I realised it is very nice to read grotesque things in novels but actually encountering it is a bit too much.When I saw it, I told myself what I have been doing is making rasogullah out of human tears. After all, a work of art is a beautiful object. That day the individual asked the artist what is the use of doing it. If you want to change society, you should become Baba Amte or Mother Teresa. If a writer or an artist thinks that he can solve the problems of the world, he is living in a fool’s paradise.Perhaps, that was the time when your works were described as decorativeIt is decorative. I was trying to create a new language which was suitable for modern India because of my training from a school which started working on this visual language in the pre-Independent period. Nandlal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij were trying to create an Indian visual language. It was not an extension of what was happening abroad. I wanted to take it closer to my home in Kerala. So I did a thesis on Kerala paintings. I started realising that the grammar of Oriental art is totally different. There is no realism in the way you understand it in Europe. There, you don’t go beyond the skin, here you create a parallel body which is not there but creates a beautiful feeling. It is like Malayalam language grammar is different from that of English. If you don’t know the grammar, you cannot play with the language.Also, people forget that decorativeness is part of Indian psyche. We see it in our temples and churches and in our music and dance. The word was used by Europeans to describe our work in a derogatory sense when they failed to come to terms with Oriental art.You mastered this language with ‘Yayati’I did a very close study of Indian miniature and wall paintings. One must understand that I never painted gods and goddesses. In ‘Yayati’, what I did was what Girish Karnad achieved in ‘Tughlaq’ – using myth to interpret something else. In the present day context., ‘Yayati’ is a painting which deals with a modern man’s endless search for pleasure. Now it could be a telephone or a lift – a modern man’s desperation to live as perfect as possible. This has brought us to the level of complete environmental degradation.Were you the first one to make this shift?No, Nandlal Bose did it. Abanindranath did it. They were my heroes. To move away from the British influence, the Constitution and Padma awards were designed by Nandlal.How was your experience at Jamia?Jamia was good for me. At that time, it was outside the city. There were very enlightened people in the administration. I did ‘Kali Puja’, headless and nude images in the studio but nobody said anything to me. Artist Abul Kalam, who brought me, was a student of Nandlal Bose. There were no jarring notes. As I was a practising artist, I could come to the city and show my work at Kumar Gallery with other major artists.You also like to make an appearance in your paintingsThat’s because of the Malayali sense of humour. We have a sutradhar or a narrator who connects scenes. I appear as insects, birds and even as a bat, which signifies that I am neither contemporary nor ancient. I am neither a bird nor a beast.As a sculptor, what is your take on the proliferation of statues?Most of them are portraits and have a ‘gudiya’ approach. They are not artistic. In comparison, Pushkin’s statue, in front of Rabindra Bhawan, stands out. It has movement and action. You see, great monuments are made by great patrons.Does an artist have a retirement age?After retirement, I decided that I would devote my life to painting. I go into my studio at 10.30-11a.m. and come down around 7.30-8 p.m. I have a good library and a good collection of miniatures. I am not the only one Nandlal Bose could not walk but still would do one painting every day. I believe every artist should work very hard. There is no point in waiting for inspiration. There is nothing of that sort. You have to work like a daily labourer. Once I finish I don’t even look at it. I put it in storage and it goes to the gallery. I move to a new challenge. If you ask me to copy my work, I can’t. People think there is a formula, there is none. Even if I apply the same colour again, I will not get the same effect. I may be going and sketching but there is no lotus like these. They are born in my mind....On Chameli RamachandranShe made me and protected me. It was because of her support that I survived those 10-15 years when no gallery touched my work. She said you do your thing. Thankfully, I had a job. Within a year in Delhi I found out that I can’t make friends in embassies over a glass of wine and that I can’t run after collectors. We have lived a very modest life. The money has come only six-seven years.On auctionsWe borrowed all this from western culture. After the royal patronage, there was nobody to take care of artists. In China and Japan even a poor person likes to buy at least one original painting. We don’t have that culture. Till yesterday, even the richest people would buy only calendars. Today they are buying a Raza or a Husain because they know what they are buying for two rupees will be sold for 10 rupees. I don’t call it art appreciation; it is only investment. The galleries introduce you to artists whose works bring you five more rupees. It is not about art.On art educationWe have reached this stage because children are not taught art appreciation from a young age. Our text books are horrible to look at. During art competitions, organisers ask them to paint jawans and tricolour or a scenery. Once should not give any theme to children. Only thing that you should provide to children is sufficient colours and let them do what they feel like. There used to be a school run by an English lady. She used to teach art and psychoanalyse what the child did in the class. One of my friend’s son was there. One day the teacher called her to say that she asked about her relationship with her husband because the child always paints his father in black colour. When she asked her son he said all other colours are taken by other kids so he is always left with black colour. That is the reason people are unable to look at paintings. They look for captions to get an insight into the painting. The tragedy is that art has become more vocal. Some artists who are not well-educated become dependant on curators. They tell the artist what he is doing and the poor artist believes.“The Changing Mood of the Lotus Pond and Insignificant Incarnations” is on at Shridharani Art Gallery, New Delhi till December 2"

In pursuit of pure art, A. Ramachandran talks about his abiding romance with lotus and how literature informs his craft
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Unlike the densely populated lotus ponds on his canvas, it is easier to navigate A. Ramachandran’s mind. On a balmy November afternoon, the veteran artist turns to his background in literature and music to take one through his distinguished career where he swam against the tide to create an Indian idiom in modern art. We meet at Triveni Kala Sangam where Vadhera Art Gallery is holding an exhibition of his works at the Shridharani Art Gallery. With a walking stick in hand, the 83-year-old took us to the lotus ponds of Ubeshwar, Nagada, Jogi Talab and Ekalinji near Udaipur to explain their changing moods.“I was fascinated by the Bhil tribe and during my journeys to Rajasthan, I discovered these ponds,” informs Ramachandran. “I used to go three or four times a year and spend a week there. I would start in the morning and start sketching. The more I sketched, the more I understood. As an artist, I could see the contour lines – I always use contour lines. When you see the rhythmic lines, you notice the decorative patterns of nature. Nature is more decorative,” he insists as you would discover later. “I used to take a boat. The leaves would give me passage and when I would cross they would close again. It was like mother’s womb, wet, slimy and full of insects. The patches of skyline above made it a visual delight,” exults the Padma Bhushan who learnt his craft at Santiniketan under the watchful eyes of Nandlal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij.“The way of teaching in Santiniketan was to ask students to go out and sketch. It was not like the British academic system. The student was expected to look outside and start drawing himself without a static model. They wanted students to observe nature and sketch whatever they liked. That practice has stopped but if you can achieve it, you have the freedom to become an artist of your own stature. You need not borrow concepts from somebody else or copy some other artist’s style. This way your work will be your own interpretation of the world.”After studying at Santiniketan, unlike his contemporaries, Ramachandran didn’t go abroad to find his artistic moorings. When he came to Delhi, he started working with contemporaries like Krishen Khanna and Tyeb Mehta and later joined Jamia Millia Islamia as a faculty in Fine Arts department. “After some time, I had a feeling that I have something different and distinct in my genes as a Malayali.” A post graduate in Malayalam literature, Ramachandran was in touch with most of the progressive writers of the language including Vaikom Mohammad Basheer. “They changed the Malayalam literature from a highly Sanskritised form to something that talked about social realism in a colloquial form. In the same way, I felt that if I would paint my realities, the appeal would be universal. You need not follow European trends to show that you are making modern art. Of course, I had used them in my early works when my concerns were more political, but I gradually gave that up. Like pure music, I wanted to do pure painting. Art carries much more authenticity when you handle things which are intimate to you.”Despite the efforts of his teachers, Ramachandran feels that we never really developed the Indian way of teaching art. “We are so overawed by Picasso and Matisse that we are importing ideas and exporting products. Malayalam writers did draw from Maupassant and Flaubert but once they looked around their own life they developed a new idiom. Basheer only wrote about his family and Muslim community in colloquial language. That’s the modernism of Malayalam literature. I am looking for that kind of modernism in Indian art. You not only have to look inward but also be authentic.”Excerpts from a free-wheeling conversation:You were also inspired by the likes of Fyodor Dostoevsky...Yes, but you cannot put Dostoevsky in pictorial form. I had to have something else. Even Dostoevsky had to open the Bible before he wrote ‘Crime and Punishment’ and that lends it a spiritual quality. To me, art is not political journalism, which is very temporary. Today, if you make a painting on Emergency, it carries no weight. Even Partition has been erased out of people’s memory. Such a calamity should have produced great works. Artists like Krishen Khanna and Satish Gujral did create some works but not like what Manto did in literature.So you don’t like socio-political messaging through artworks?Van Gogh didn’t do any political work. His ‘Sunflowers’ is greater than Picasso’s ‘Guernica’. ‘Guernica’ didn’t end any world war. There is still a war going on. It worked because some features of war in it functioned very well in a political way. Hariprasad Chaurasiya doesn’t utter a word but he is a great musician. Music has its own status. Similarly, I feel, painting has its own status. It need not carry message and slogans on the surface. It need not shout at a high pitch. A quiet work can affect you as well.When I watched slaughtering of goats in the Kamakhya temple, I was shocked by human beings turning into animals. Even a child there had tremendous violence on his face. Around the same time, there was the Naxalite Movement where young, bright students were being killed by the State. In that background, I made “Kali Puja” (1972). It was a political statement. But, today, my lotus speaks far better.What does it stand for?It speaks for something greater in life. It shows the world that we have got is so beautiful; it needs to be preserved. When I first visited Udaipur, it was an untouched land. Now after 40 years of my travel, I find it hard to find wild lotus ponds. Many of them have beencleanedup and made into bathing ghats with marble steps.Also, as an artist the more you contemplate in nature, the more you understand that there is another universe where we are superfluous. I cannot explain it in an urban environment. It is a spiritual feeling that you get when you are in nature, looking at not just the lotus but also its leaves, the insects that make them their home, the fungi in the water...we don’t have that kind of perception.

Was any case initiated on 22 unidentified bodies: HC
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/was-any-case-initiated-on-22-unidentified-bodies-hc/article25618382.ece,"
Says police, other probe agencies failed to ‘live up to the task’ in anti-Sikh riots trial
",,"The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Delhi Police to find out if any criminal case was initiated in connection with 22 unidentified bodies, out of a total of 95 bodies, of victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Capital’s Trilokpuri.Justice R.K. Gauba said, “It is likely that 22 homicidal deaths may not have seen any criminal action initiated against anyone till date.”Justice Gauba said that prosecutions in this case covered only 73 homicidal deaths, whereas a total of 95 bodies were “gathered during the night of November 2-3, 1984,” the FIR states.The High Court noted that despite numerous documents in the nature of death and autopsy reports of the 22 bodies being part record of this case, no agency till date has “taken pains to examine” if any criminal action can be initiated against anyone.‘Re-examine material’“In the foregoing facts and circumstances, this court directs the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, to have the material, and the evidence, in above nature, re-examined by an appropriate agency for such further action under the criminal law as may be requisite,” the High Court said.In its 79-page verdict upholding the conviction and five-year jail term of 70 convicts, Justice Gauba said the police did not promptly register the crimes and collect evidence and the other agencies, including the prosecution and the trial court, failed to “live up to the task.”The High Court further pointed out that even the criminal prosecution initiated through the chargesheets which were submitted in December 1985, the question of charge could not come up for consideration till December 1995. “The trial judge, when he set about the task of consideration for framing of charge, found, upon the prosecution itself advising him to this effect, that the case as presented 10 years earlier suffered from the defect,” it said. The charges were eventually framed, after splitting up of the cases, in January 1996.Justice Gauba remarked that “clearly, the investigating agency, and the prosecution agency had had no coordination between themselves.”“The fact that the initial two charge sheets presented in December 1985 were prepared, also under the advice of the prosecution branch shows that the quality of the legal assistance availed of by the State was questionable,” it said."

Riot victims denied justice for a very long time: AAP
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Chief Minister and national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday welcomed the Delhi High Court’s judgment in the upholding the conviction of around 80 people for rioting during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.Mr. Kejriwal, however, argued that “big fish” wanted for their involvement in the incident were still roaming free and justice had so far not been done to the riot victims even after 34 years in this respect.The HC on Wednesday upheld the conviction of around 80 people and awarded them five-year jail term for rioting, burning houses and violation of curfew during the anti-Sikh riots. “I welcome Delhi High Court judgment upholding the conviction of 88 culprits responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocent people in Trilokpuri during 1984 riots. Justice has so far not been done to riot victims even after 34 years. Big fish are still roaming free,” Mr. Kejriwal said in a tweet.The AAP, in a statement, argued that there was no doubt that the families of the 1984 riots victims had been “denied justice for a very long time” and even in this case since the first conviction by the trial court in 1996, it has taken 22 years for the appeal having been decided.Hits out at parties“It is a matter of grave concern that first the investigating agencies and then the justice delivery mechanism has taken 34 years in the 1984 riots cases before the cases have begun to be decided. Further, till date no big fish has been brought to book in the worst riots in India’s national Capital, which have left Delhi broken forever; the 1984 riots are a blot on Delhi which cannot be erased forever,” the statement said.The AAP also trained its guns at the Congress as well as the BJP and its ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SADTill the Congress was in power at the Centre, the AAP argued, ‘nobody expected any progress’ in the riots cases, but what was ‘extremely surprising’ was that the BJP and the SAD “did nothing for victims even when their government was at the Centre for six years between 1998 and 2004”.“It took a new party the Aam Aadmi Party, which during its 49-day government in Delhi in 2013 for the first time in history decided to set-up a Special Investigation Team to probe the 1984 riots,” the AAP argued."

Alliance of parties is an alternative built to save democratic institutions

Chandrababu Naidu predicted that the next government will be a non-NDA one as “the writing is on the wall” for the current NDA regime.“The nation gave an absolute majority to the Modi government which even Vajpayee could not muster but he has misused the opportunity to the disappointment of the entire nation. The country is under mental duress where people are scared of even using a telephone. There is neither development, nor freedom, nor happiness,” he said, in a media interaction here on Thursday.‘For democracy’Stating that there was a “democratic compulsion” for all parties to come together against BJP, he said it was not a one-man initiative but all parties thinking alike to form an alternative to “save the nation” and its democratic institutions. “We are confident about people believing in us and we have received a good response,” he said.At the same time, Mr. Naidu appeared to have ruled himself out of contention for the top post claiming, “I don’t have any such ambition. I have built Cyberabad here and have to develop Amaravati into a modern global city for which the eco-system will take five to 10 years to develop. People of AP need my attention and my agenda is unfinished there.”Mr. Naidu recalled he had demanded Mr. Modi’s resignation after the Godhra riots and told the then PM Vajpayee to choose between the nation and Gujarat. “I thought he is a changed person and it would have been good for the country but it is possible he (Modi) is holding it against me,” he said. However, he claimed TDP was never ideologically aligned to BJP and it was only a political alliance whereas it has no differences with Congress on ideology. He took the lead to bring various parties together after instances of “personal victimisation, suppression and misuse of ED, CBI, IT” and other institutions began.Pan-India presenceAnd, having noticed that without Congress the goal cannot be achieved, given its pan-India presence, he reached out to Rahul Gandhi and struck a chord with him despite being in opposite side of the fence for 37 years.The AP CM also argued that single party dominated governments resulted in “Hindu rate of growth of 3%” whereas minority govt.s beginning with P.V.

After all, a work of art is a beautiful object. That day the individual asked the artist what is the use of doing it. If you want to change society, you should become Baba Amte or Mother Teresa. If a writer or an artist thinks that he can solve the problems of the world, he is living in a fool’s paradise.Perhaps, that was the time when your works were described as decorativeIt is decorative. I was trying to create a new language which was suitable for modern India because of my training from a school which started working on this visual language in the pre-Independent period. Nandlal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij were trying to create an Indian visual language. It was not an extension of what was happening abroad. I wanted to take it closer to my home in Kerala. So I did a thesis on Kerala paintings. I started realising that the grammar of Oriental art is totally different. There is no realism in the way you understand it in Europe. There, you don’t go beyond the skin, here you create a parallel body which is not there but creates a beautiful feeling. It is like Malayalam language grammar is different from that of English. If you don’t know the grammar, you cannot play with the language.Also, people forget that decorativeness is part of Indian psyche. We see it in our temples and churches and in our music and dance. The word was used by Europeans to describe our work in a derogatory sense when they failed to come to terms with Oriental art.You mastered this language with ‘Yayati’I did a very close study of Indian miniature and wall paintings. One must understand that I never painted gods and goddesses. In ‘Yayati’, what I did was what Girish Karnad achieved in ‘Tughlaq’ – using myth to interpret something else. In the present day context., ‘Yayati’ is a painting which deals with a modern man’s endless search for pleasure. Now it could be a telephone or a lift – a modern man’s desperation to live as perfect as possible. This has brought us to the level of complete environmental degradation.Were you the first one to make this shift?No, Nandlal Bose did it. Abanindranath did it. They were my heroes. To move away from the British influence, the Constitution and Padma awards were designed by Nandlal.How was your experience at Jamia?Jamia was good for me. At that time, it was outside the city. There were very enlightened people in the administration. I did ‘Kali Puja’, headless and nude images in the studio but nobody said anything to me. Artist Abul Kalam, who brought me, was a student of Nandlal Bose. There were no jarring notes. As I was a practising artist, I could come to the city and show my work at Kumar Gallery with other major artists.You also like to make an appearance in your paintingsThat’s because of the Malayali sense of humour. We have a sutradhar or a narrator who connects scenes. I appear as insects, birds and even as a bat, which signifies that I am neither contemporary nor ancient. I am neither a bird nor a beast.As a sculptor, what is your take on the proliferation of statues?Most of them are portraits and have a ‘gudiya’ approach. They are not artistic. In comparison, Pushkin’s statue, in front of Rabindra Bhawan, stands out. It has movement and action. You see, great monuments are made by great patrons.Does an artist have a retirement age?After retirement, I decided that I would devote my life to painting. I go into my studio at 10.30-11a.m. and come down around 7.30-8 p.m. I have a good library and a good collection of miniatures. I am not the only one Nandlal Bose could not walk but still would do one painting every day. I believe every artist should work very hard. There is no point in waiting for inspiration. There is nothing of that sort. You have to work like a daily labourer. Once I finish I don’t even look at it. I put it in storage and it goes to the gallery. I move to a new challenge. If you ask me to copy my work, I can’t. People think there is a formula, there is none. Even if I apply the same colour again, I will not get the same effect. I may be going and sketching but there is no lotus like these. They are born in my mind....“The Changing Mood of the Lotus Pond and Insignificant Incarnations” is on at Shridharani Art Gallery, New Delhi till December 2"

Gareth Bale scored one and supplied the cross that led to another as Lucas Vazquez wrapped up a clinical 2-0 win at the Stadio Olimpico that was a world away from Real's 3-0 Liga defeat to Eibar at the weekend.“It was important to bounce back quickly,” said Real coach Santiago Solari. “We are very happy.”Real are three points clear of Roma going into their final Group G match against CSKA Moscow next month.Mario Mandzukic booked Juventus' ticket for the knock-out phase with a simple tap-in after a sublime piece of skill and cross from Ronaldo as Juventus beat Valencia 1-0.The Italians have 12 points, two more than United but both are home and dry because Valencia only have five.In Lyon, City took a point from a pulsating match after Maxwel Cornet scored two second-half goals including an outstanding long-range effort only for the French side to be pinned back each time. City's French defender Aymeric Laporte equalised first and then Aguero out-jumped taller defenders to head home and spark wild celebrations from manager Pep Guardiola.Lyon are left needing a draw against Shakhtar Donetsk in their final Group F game next month to go through after the Ukrainian club stunned Hoffenheim 3-2 away to stay in contention.Greek riot police wielding batons entered the stands at the Athens Olympic Stadium to separate fighting fans, leaving 11 Ajax supporters injured, police said.

Says police, other probe agencies failed to ‘live up to the task’ in anti-Sikh riots trial
",,"The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Delhi Police to find out if any criminal case was initiated in connection with 22 unidentified bodies, out of a total of 95 bodies, of victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Capital’s Trilokpuri.Justice R.K. Gauba said, “It is likely that 22 homicidal deaths may not have seen any criminal action initiated against anyone till date.”Justice Gauba said that prosecutions in this case covered only 73 homicidal deaths, whereas a total of 95 bodies were “gathered during the night of November 2-3, 1984,” the FIR states.The High Court noted that despite numerous documents in the nature of death and autopsy reports of the 22 bodies being part record of this case, no agency till date has “taken pains to examine” if any criminal action can be initiated against anyone.‘Re-examine material’“In the foregoing facts and circumstances, this court directs the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, to have the material, and the evidence, in above nature, re-examined by an appropriate agency for such further action under the criminal law as may be requisite,” the High Court said.In its 79-page verdict upholding the conviction and five-year jail term of 70 convicts, Justice Gauba said the police did not promptly register the crimes and collect evidence and the other agencies, including the prosecution and the trial court, failed to “live up to the task.”The High Court further pointed out that even the criminal prosecution initiated through the chargesheets which were submitted in December 1985, the question of charge could not come up for consideration till December 1995. “The trial judge, when he set about the task of consideration for framing of charge, found, upon the prosecution itself advising him to this effect, that the case as presented 10 years earlier suffered from the defect,” it said. The charges were eventually framed, after splitting up of the cases, in January 1996.Justice Gauba remarked that “clearly, the investigating agency, and the prosecution agency had had no coordination between themselves.”“The fact that the initial two charge sheets presented in December 1985 were prepared, also under the advice of the prosecution branch shows that the quality of the legal assistance availed of by the State was questionable,” it said."

She has been accused of inciting communal enmity ",,"The police on Tuesday arrested Rehana Fathima, 39, an advocate of gender equality and women’s rights, on the charge of having attempted to foment enmity between communities by posting religiously controversial comments and pictures pertaining to the entry of women of all age groups to Sabarimala.A police team from Pathanamthitta secured the custody of the BSNL employee from her office in Kochi. The Kerala Muslim Jamaat Council had censured her earlier on the charge of hurting Hindu religious sentiments.The police will produce Ms. Fathima before a magistrate in Pathanamthitta soon. They booked her on the charge of having outraged the religious feelings of a community by insulting their religion under Section 295 (A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The Section carries a punishment of up to four years of imprisonment with fine or both.The police said she was arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by Radhakrishna Menon. He alleged that Ms. Fathima had posted pictures of herself dressed in the typical dark garb of an Ayyappa devotee and captioned the snaps ""tatvamasi"" hurting Hindu sentiments. Earlier, the High Court had denied Ms. Fathima's plea for anticipatory bail in the case.Ms. Fathima, the mother of two children, had courted controversy when she attempted to trek to Sabarimala in the company of Hyderabad-based journalist Kavitha during the puja in October.A huge posse of police officers in riot gear escorted them within a km of the temple. However, the women had to return in the face of stiff opposition from Sangh Parivar activists.Ms. Fathima was in the spotlight in 2012 when she championed the “Kiss of Love” movement; a non-violent protest organised largely by apolitical youth against what they described as the tendency of certain groups to police the behaviour of couples in public spaces or “moral vigilantism.”Ms. Fathima had also challenged social mores by getting women to stage the “tiger dance or pulikali” traditionally performed by men during Onam festival. Her activism had earned her the ire of reactionary elements, who vandalised her house in Kochi recently. She had faced vilification in the social media and life threats."

U.S. forces drive out migrants who stormed Mexico border

Fire tear gas, rubber bullets at hundreds who tried to cross the fence; 42 arrested
",,"Hundreds of Central American migrants who tried to force through a Mexican police blockade into the United States retreated to a nearby camp on Monday after U.S. border agents pushed them back with tear gas and rubber bullets.Around 500 men, women and children, part of a caravan of roughly 5,000 mainly Hondurans who have been trekking towards the U.S. for weeks, scrambled over a rusted metal fence and surged into a concrete riverbed towards San Diego on Sunday.The group was stopped by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire and repelled by U.S. Border Patrol agents firing tear gas shells and rubber bullets, an AFP journalist on the scene saw. At least one man was wounded.Chief Patrol Agent Rodney Scott, of the San Diego Sector Border Patrol, told CNN “numerous” migrants — mainly men — had made it across, however, and 42 of them were arrested.Most of the migrants stumbled back into camp in the northwestern Mexican city of Tijuana, dirty, scared and with ripped clothes. “We’re here with broken hearts and hopes,” said Andy Colon, a 20-year-old woman, who travelled from Honduras with her sister and two children. “We were deluded into believing that we had already reached the United States, and that they would grant us asylum,” said Ms. Colon.U.S. President Donald Trump, who for weeks has been condemning the caravan, lashed out once more on Monday. “Mexico should move the flag waving migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,” he tweeted.“Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!” Mr. Trump said, referring to his central election pledge to build a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border.98 deportedMany of the migrants say they are fleeing violence and poverty in Honduras in search of asylum north of the border.After the unrest, Mexico on Monday deported 98 Central Americans, following their arrest.Around 1,000 migrants, including women and young children, had been holding a peaceful midday demonstration in Tijuana when half of the group bolted toward the border. The sudden rush overwhelmed the Mexican police, who were deployed with full riot gear.Children faintedSeveral hundred made it over the first barrier, with video clips posted on Twitter showing crowds of people dashing across a shallow concrete riverbed towards the United States. “Are we in the United States yet?” some asked in desperate tones.When they neared the second fence U.S. border agents fired tear gas and rubber bullets at them as helicopters buzzed overhead, an AFP journalist saw. People covered their faces to protect themselves from the acrid gas, as mothers clutched their young children and fled back to Mexico for safety.“We were told that if we crossed (the first barrier) they would give us asylum, because we were already in the United States,” said Flor Jimenez, a 32-year-old Honduran woman, who was among those who turned back along with her husband, sister and young daughter. “But now it seems that they want to kill us, and we got very scared,” she said.A Honduran man, who did not give his name, said American officers “got upset because we were close to the border.” “The alarm went off and they began throwing tear gas at us. A lot of people started to go down. A person got hit and lots of kids fainted. So some people got rocks and threw them because many kids were fainting.”Another man, who wished to remain unnamed, showed AFP what he described as injuries from rubber bullets. He had two fresh round bruises in his abdomen."

Mahipalpur riot case: Audacity of hope, renewed
",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/audacity-of-hope-renewed/article25593334.ece,"
Last week, a Delhi court awarded death penalty and life term to Yashpal Singh and Naresh Sehrawat respectively for the murders of two Sikh men in Mahipalpur on November 1, 1984. Thirty-four years after they lost their loved ones, families still fighting cases tell The Hindu how the November 14 verdict has restrengthen their resolve to keep fighting for justice
",https://th.thgim.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png,"Gopi Kaur keeps glancing at her husband Hotu Singh’s black and white photograph on the side table in her two-room home.The 72-year-old’s son Daljeet Singh, an autorickshaw driver, sits next to her. Daljeet’s curious 9-year-old peeps inside the room, his tiny brow scrunch up in concentration as he tries to follow the topic of discussion he has heard so much about — the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that claimed his grandfather’s life.Daljeet was just 2-year-old when his father was killed. Over the next few years, his bedtime stories revolved around how his father and other relatives were beaten and torched to death, why his mother had to go to court every few weeks and why he could not get formal education because his mother did not have enough money.Daljeet and many others like him believe they have lived the history which others have only read about in class. Daljeet’s cousin Gurbachan Singh, who was 1-year-old at the time of the riots, said his childhood memories are marred by the stories his mother told him.“I was told how our house was set on fire, and how my father and grandfather were beaten up. How we stayed in the camp and how there was no food or water while we were in hiding,” says a teary eyed Gurbachan.Painful pastAfter the cousins, now Daljeet’s son is told repeatedly about his family’s painful brush with the riots.“If we do not tell them about the riots, they will learn about it from others. It is a painful part of their life they have to live with. Who else will continue the fight,” asks Gopi.OnNovember 14, a Delhi court convicted Yashpal Singhand Naresh Sehrawat for the murders of Avtar Singh and Hardev Singh in Mahipalpur on November 1, 1984. On November 20, Yashpal was awarded capital punishment and Naresh life imprisonment. The verdict has brought hope to all families who have been fighting for justice for the past 34 years.“Ab lagta hai ki shayad kuch ho jaaye. Hamari ladai zaya nahi jayegi. Humein poori umeed hai[Now we have hope that something will happen. Our fight will not go waste. We have complete hope],” says the septuagenarian.Recalling her life before the riots, Gopi says she lived in Sultanpuri with her husband and their five children. Her husband drove an autorickshaw and the family lived a comfortable life. Talking vividly about November 1, 1984, as if it happened yesterday, she says she remembers how a mob, allegedly by Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, chopped her husband’s legs before setting him on fire.‘Gurdwara set afire’“The gurdwara was set on fire. A few, including my husband, asked the mob why they had set the gurdwara on fire. The police asked them to return home. My husband came back. He and the children were in a room and I was in the lobby. Those people [in the mob] forced their way inside our house. They broke into the room, took him out in the street and killed him,” she recalls.“Unhone un logon ko kaha tha ki bacchon ke samne mat marna… mujhe kaha bacchon ko bacha lena…[He told them not to kill him in front of the children... He told me to save the children,” she says.Gopi ran to the first floor, where a man from Nepal lived with his wife and a son. He let Gopi and her children stay though non-Sikh families were asked to not shelter Sikh families.“Daljeet kept asking for water. But there was no water and no one could go outside. I made him relieve himself in a cup and then wet his lips...,” she adds with a sob.If the riots were tough, life in the aftermath was unimaginable. The family lived in a camp in Rani Bagh for a week before returning home to ashes. A year later, the Tilak Vihar’s ‘Widow Colony’ was born. All those who had lost family members in the riots were rehabilitated there.Gopi raised her children by becoming a house help, something she had never envisioned herself doing.“An entire generation was left uneducated because of the riots... We all had to start earning as soon as possible because our mothers did not have enough money to educate us,” says Daljeet.But life moves on. Gopi’s children grew up, started earning, got married and gave her grandchildren. In fact, she says wryly, she is now a heart patient since she had a minor attack.Nonetheless, the senior citizen and her bundle of painful memories still trudge to court every few months to fight her case in the hope of justice. A hope now strengthened after the November 14 verdict.Horrific memoriesSheela Kaur, a 55-year-old mother of five, too lost her husband in the riots. She was just 21 and lived with her family in Sultanpuri in 1984. When asked her story, she narrates it in one go, almost as if giving a statement in a court. At this remark, she says she has retold her story many times since the late 1980s — mostly in court — but cannot give the exact number of times she has had to relive that horrific day.Sheela lost her husband Balbir Singh, father-in-law Basant Singh and brother-in-law Balihar Singh. Her son — her only biological child with Balbir Singh — was 2-year-old at the time of the incident. After the riots, Sheela was forcibly married off to her surviving brother-in-law who was younger than her and an alcoholic.“In the park nearby, [Congress leader] Sajjan Kumar was encouraging people to kill Sikhs [on November 1,1984]. They came, took away all three of them and thrashed them before setting them on fire. I tried to save them but they said they will kill me too if I did not leave,” she recalls.“He [her second husband] is no more but he would get drunk and beat me. My first husband was a kind and decent man. He was employed and took care of us. I lost more than a husband in the riots, I also lost my life too,” she says, as she recalls how a Muslim family gave shelter to her remaining family and her. She says she will always remain grateful to them.‘225 cases closed’Atma Singh, member of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and president of Victims of 1984-Anti-Sikh Riots Society, claims nearly 3,000 people were killed and about 5,000 injured in the 1984 riots. He says 483 First Information Reports were registered but 9 cases are still pending trial.“Over 225 were closed. The reason given was that witnesses in the cases could not be traced. For the last few years, we [the survivors] had mellowed down but this [November 14] verdict has given us the strength to fight vigorously for many years to come,” he adds."

But, Cong govt at the Centre then & in 2017 Shashi Tharoor-led committee tried to deny the corridor. Now, our efforts fructified with the Cabinet decision to open up the corridor.”"
