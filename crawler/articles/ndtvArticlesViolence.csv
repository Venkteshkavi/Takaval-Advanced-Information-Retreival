Students boycotted classes and staged sit-ins demanding stringent punishment.Advocates practicing in Coimbatore staged a demonstration outside the court complex seeking an inquiry committee with a woman judge of the Madras High Court as its head to probe the case.The district administration ordered closure of colleges in the town, 535 km from Chennai, to prevent a repeat of yesterday's protest by students demanding action against the culprits -- Thirunavukkarasu, Sabarirajan, Vasanthakumar, Satish -- now in custody and also others who are still out.For days, rumours and video clips have been doing rounds on social media as to how scores of women from college teachers, students, even working professionals and others weresexually assaulted, harassed and blackmailedby the gang.Students of Sri GVG Visalakshi College for Women in nearby Udumalaipettai protested on Thursday hit the streets shouting 'We want justice.'

Police later said four people, who they did not identify, were in custody and one had been charged with murder over the country's worst ever mass shooting.On Wednesday, the Twitter handle @brentontarrant tweeted pictures of one of the guns later used in the mosque attacks in the city of Christchurch. It was covered in white lettering, featuring the names of others who had committed race- or religion-based killings; Cyrillic, Armenian and Georgian references to historical figures and events; and the phrase: ""Here's Your Migration Compact"".The number ""14"" was written on the side of the rifle as well, a reference to the ""fourteen words"", a white supremacist mantra.Other tweets from the same user on that day included references to declining white fertility rates, articles about right-wing extremists in various countries and stories about purported crimes by illegal immigrants.The Twitter profile had 63 tweets, 218 followers and was created last month.A person involved with the attacks also appeared to post regularly to the ""/pol/ - Politically Incorrect"" forum on 8chan, a online discussion site known for allowing virtually any content, including hate speech.About 1:30 p.m. on Friday, the anonymous user told the group ""I will carry out and attack against the invaders, and willeven livestream the attack via Facebook""; approving responses to the post included Nazi images and memes.The post featured a link to a 74-page manifesto that said he was motivated by ""white genocide"", a term white supremacists use to describe immigration and the growth of minority populations.

""We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware.""YouTube, which is owned by Google, tweeted: ""Our hearts are broken over today's terrible tragedy in New Zealand.""A Twitter representative said the social media company was ""deeply saddened"" by the shootings.""Twitter has rigorous processes and a dedicated team in place for managing exigent and emergency situations such as this,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""We also cooperate with law enforcement to facilitate their investigations as required.""Nolwenn Bervas, lead terrorism analyst at the Risk Advisory Group, said the were numerous places around the internet for people such as the Christchurch attacker to congregate.""The amount of information and propaganda linked to the far-right, far-left or jihadism is extensive and accessible,"" Bervas said. ""One of the Christchurch perpetrators posted his manifesto online before the attack where he wrote that he received/researched/developed his beliefs on the Internet, adding 'You will not find the truth anywhere else'. He cited people like Dylan Roof or Anders Breivik as inspirations, who also researched and developed their beliefs online.""Anwita Basu, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said social media had shifted global security risks. ""More than anything, social media has provided a platform for sharing extremist views.""No remorseWhen the attack began on Friday, one anonymous 8chan user remarked: ""actually happening. delete this thread now or its gonna be the end of 8pol.""A few minutes later, another said ""this sounds fun"". ""Nice shootin Tex,"" another commented.The Facebook livestream of the attack, apparently recorded with a head-mounted camera, began about 1:40 p.m. local time. The attacker plays music as he drives to the mosque, including a British grenadiers march and a Serbian anti-Muslim hate anthem called ""Remove Kebab"".Once he arrives in the Hagley Park district of Christchurch, the attacker parks the car and opens the rear hatch, revealing a cache of guns, ammunition and what appear to be red fuel containers.Picking up two guns, both covered in names and slogans, he walks around the corner to the entrance of a mosque and begins shooting.The livestream ended less than 20 minutes later. The suspected shooter was arrested about 3 p.m.""Do you feel any remorse for the attack""? the author asks self-referentially in the manifesto.

Mr Khan, in a tweet, said PM Modi told him that it is time for people of the subcontinent to work together ""for a peaceful and prosperous region, in an atmosphere free of terror and violence"".Mr Khan said he welcomes PM Modi's message and that he believes it is time to begin a comprehensive dialogue with India to address and resolve all issues.

In February we were very clear, any attempt by Pakistan High Commission or Pakistani leadership to engage with Hurriyat leaders will not be taken lightly,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.Indian officials reportedly stood outside the Pakistan High Commission and were seen discouraging Indian guests from attending the event.None of the separatists from Kashmir, however, attended the event this year as most of them either are in jail or under house arrest after amajor crackdown by the government last month. The ones who are not jailed fear their arrest or another crackdown.Kashmiri human rights activist Mohammed Ahsan Untoo was briefly detained when he was going for the reception.In the past too, New Delhi has insisted that Pakistan hold talks with India directly on differences over Kashmir and other issues, and has discouraged Islamabad from having direct contact with the Hurriyat leaders.In the earlier years, India sent a minister to the Pakistan High Commission for the reception every year even though separatists were invited.Tensions between the two countries have been heightened after the terror attack last month in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama which 40 Central Reserve Police Force or CRPF soldiers were killed. The attack had been claimed by Pak-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed which is led by Masood Azhar.India then carried out ""non-military, pre-emptive"" air strikes on a Jaish terror training camp in Pakistan's Balakot.

The curfew was imposed as authorities feared a communal backlash, they added.Protesters, particularly in the old city, refused to disperse even after loudspeakers announced that curfew was imposed.""We have imposed curfew in Jammu city as a precautionary measure,"" Deputy Commissioner of Jammu Ramesh Kumar told news agency PTI.There was a complete shutdown in Jammu city, with no traffic on roads and all shops and markets closed.Several areas of Jammu were hit by massive anti-Pakistan protests with people taking to the streets, including Jewel Chowk, Purani Mundi, Rehari, Shaktinagar, Pacca Danga, Janipur, Gandhinagar and Bakshinagar.According to some reports, there were mob attacks in Gujjar Nagar area where several vehicles were damaged by stone-throwers. However, the police said they had managed to prevent a major clash.Kashmiri employees at Jammu's Tourist Reception Centre have sent SOS messages to police seeking protection after mobs burnt vehicles outside TRC and pelted stones.Raising slogans against Pakistan and terrorists, protesters burnt tyres on roads. Demonstrators put up barricades demanding that the attacks be avenged.Jammu and Kashmir leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah condemned the violence.Distressed to hear about miscreants in Jammu trying to take advantage of the situation by inciting tension. Guv adm should have preempted this by securing minority dominated areas. Have spoken to IG Jammu to deploy additional security.It will be a travesty & against the spirit of our secular ethno-cultural values to use this terror attack as an excuse to target minorities. Hour of the need is to show compassion & come together.Giving vent to anger by attacking innocent people because of their ethnicity or religion is no way to honour the sacrifices yesterday. Reports of violence & arson in#Jammuare deeply worrying. I hope political leaders & civil society are able to ensure cooler heads prevail.Kashmiris/Muslims in Jammu didn't attack our CRPF jawans yesterday, terrorists did. This violence is a convenient tool by some to shift the blame. Let's unite against terror let's not allow terror to divide us.Earlier, the Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries (JCCI) had on Thursday called for shutdown in Jammu protesting terror attack.Protesting the Pulwama attack, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association, Jammu, suspended work in all the courts in Jammu, including the high court and tribunals.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

"""We Win"": Northeast Rejoices As Citizenship Amendment Bill Goes Off Rails",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/northeast-rejoices-as-citizenship-amendment-bill-goes-off-rails-1993239,"The Citizenship Amendment Bill will lapse on June 3, when the term of the present Lok Sabha ends.",,"Celebrations broke out across the Northeast today as the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill-2016 lapsed before it could be ratified by the Rajya Sabha. The legislation had set off protests in the region, spurring violence and pitting communities against each other.But it's over, at least for now. Like a bad dream.The Citizenship Amendment Bill will lapse on June 3, when the term of the present Lok Sabha ends. The 17th Lok Sabha has to be constituted before that date, in the wake of the upcoming parliamentary poll in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying hard to score a re-election.While bills that remain pending in the Rajya Sabha after being introduced there are not affected by the dissolution of the lower house, those that get stuck in the upper house while coming through the Lok Sabha route do lapse. The opposition had been opposing the provisions of the two bills in the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP-led government lacks numbers.The Citizenship Amendment Bill-2019 was intended at providing Indian citizenship to all immigrants - except Muslims - from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after a mere seven years of residence even if they do not have any documents. The legislation, passed by the Lok Sabha during the winter session on January 8, had been awaiting the Rajya Sabha's approval.The development has given rise to celebrations across the Northeast, especially in the opposition camp. ""This is the victory of secular India versus communal India. We have defeated this bill, which the BJP was trying to push despite it being against the constitution,"" said Assam Leader of Opposition Debabrata Saikia.The protesters are singing a similarly joyous tune. ""It is the victory of the indigenous people of the Northeast, who came together in protest,"" said Y Dilip Kumar, who was leading protests in Manipur.But the people remain wary of the BJP, a sentiment that gives the Congress a chance to reinvent itself in the region. The ruling party, for its part, hopes to make the most of the short breather it has received from the anti-citizenship bill protests.The National People's Party, the BJP's key partner in the Northeast, feels a crisis has been averted. Party leaders said they would have had no option but to walk out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance if the bill was passed. ""Everybody from political parties to civil society groups stood together to oppose the bill. Today, the sentiments and the voice of the northeastern people have prevailed,"" said Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma, who led the regional parties' joint platform against the bill.""Here, the message for politicians is that they should not forget that they are for the people, of the people and by the people,"" said Zubeen Garg, noted Assamese singer.(With inputs from PTI)Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Man Accused In US Shooting Had Been Convicted For Beating Girlfriend,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/man-accused-in-illinois-mass-shooting-had-been-convicted-for-beating-girlfriend-with-bat-1994764,"Two decades before police said Gary Martin, 45, opened fire at his co-workers, he was convicted of aggravated assault in Mississippi.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-02/d7e0vago_gary-martin-illinois-warehouse-shooting-_625x300_17_February_19.jpg,"A ""disgruntled"" employee, who fatally shot five people and wounded five officers at an Illinois warehouse Friday, severely beat a woman years ago in a domestic violence incident that turned him into a felon - and should have kept him from buying a gun.Two decades before police said Gary Martin, 45, opened fire at his co-workers, he was convicted of aggravated assault in Mississippi. Authorities there said he regularly abused a former girlfriend, at one point, hitting her with a baseball bat and stabbing her with a knife.""All I can remember is him hitting and kicking me, I can remember fighting and screaming for help. I remember him pushing my head into that brick wall outside the apartment and thinking that he was going to kill me,"" the woman told police in Mississippi in 1994, according to court records.The incident led to Martin's arrest. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He then moved to Aurora, Illinois, where he spent 15 years working at a warehouse, where he was able to buy a gun despite his felony record, and where, on Friday afternoon, violence erupted again.Authorities in the Chicago suburb said Martin was called into a meeting at the Henry Pratt Co. warehouse. After he was told he was being fired, he began shooting, killing the three employees who were at the meeting and two others who were nearby, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman told reporters Saturday. Among the dead was an intern on his first day at work.Investigators have said little else that would explain the shooting spree, including why Martin was fired. Police do not know if he knew of his termination and planned the shootout beforehand.What police say they do know is that Martin showed up at the Henry Pratt Co. warehouse Friday armed with a Smith & Wesson handgun he was carrying illegally. Authorities also revealed Saturday that in January 2014, Martin was able to obtain an Illinois Firearm Owner's Identification Card despite his felony record, which Ziman said would not necessarily have shown up on a criminal-background check conducted before he was issued the card. The card is required to buy guns and ammunition in the state.Martin also later bought a Smith & Wesson 40-caliber handgun and applied for a concealed carry permit, which required fingerprinting. During that process, officials discovered Martin's felony conviction. His application for a concealed carry permit was rejected and his FOID card was revoked. But there was no indication that authorities confiscated his gun.The shooting rampage has renewed criticisms that Illinois' laws allow many people to have access to guns even after their FOIDs have been revoked. It carries echoes of the April 2018 shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee involving a suspect who had obtained a FOID card from Illinois. Travis Reinking, who has been charged in that shooting, had previously been arrested for trying to cross a security barrier near the White House. As a result, Illinois authorities revoked his FOID card, took his guns and gave them to his father. But Reinking later got the weapons back.""The fact remains is that some disgruntled person walked in and had access to a firearm that he shouldn't have had access to,"" Ziman told reporters, referring to Martin. ""I don't want to make it political. This is a human issue. Lives were lost.""Killed were Clayton Parks, a human resource manager at Henry Pratt; Trevor Wehner, a human resource intern and a student at Northern Illinois University; Russell Beyer, a mold operator; Vicente Juarez, a stock room attendant and fork lift operator; and Josh Pinkard, a plant manager.Wehner was killed on his first day as an intern at Henry Pratt. In a statement Saturday, Northern Illinois University president Lisa Freeman said Wehner was supposed to graduate in May with a degree in human resource management. Parks, an alumnus of the university, graduated in 2014.One warehouse employee suffered non-life-threatening gunshot wounds.The five wounded officers are all expected to survive, police said. The officers, whose names were not released, are between ages 23 and 53. The youngest has been an officer for two years and the oldest for 30 years, authorities said. A sixth officer suffered a minor injury, though it was not caused by a gunshot.Police were called to the scene just before 1:30 p.m. Friday. Within five minutes, Martin had shot the five officers who arrived at the 29,000-square-foot warehouse. He then hid in the warehouse, and police spent the next hour and a half finding him inside the massive facility. When police found Martin, he fired at the officers, who then killed him, Ziman said.Aside from his felony, Martin had been arrested six times by Aurora police on traffic and domestic violence issues. He was arrested most recently, in 2017, by police in nearby Oswego, Illinois, for disorderly conduct and damage to property, authorities said.Mississippi court records paint a picture of a disturbed man who frequently abused his former girlfriend, identified then as Chyreese Jones. Jones described Martin as a controlling man who ""fakes"" his remorse to seek attention. At one point, she told police, Martin held her and her 3-year-old daughter hostage inside their apartment, and threatened to kill her with a box cutter, court records say.On March 8, 1994, Jones asked Martin, then 20, to pack his belongings at her apartment because she wanted to end the relationship. Martin told Jones that if they were going to end their relationship, they were ""going to go out with a bang,"" she told police at that time.""'We are all going to die'"" Jones told police Martin said. ""That's when [he] began to hit me.""He kicked her in the stomach and hit her with the baseball bat, court records say. Jones ran to her neighbors, and police later found her bleeding from several stab wounds, including two deep cuts to her neck.While in prison, Martin wrote to Jones. In one letter, he appeared to blame others for his problems, telling Jones that ""they"" were doing everything to keep him incarcerated.""I don't know how much longer I can keep my thoughts to myself. I've got so much to say but I don't know who to say them to. . . . This pain and hurt is with me day and night and I just can't seem to shake it,"" Martin wrote.At the end of the letter, he said, ""Give Vozzie a big hug and kiss for me,"" referring to Jones' daughter.The shooting in Aurora occurred just a day after the first anniversary of a mass shooting that killed 17 students and staffers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The young survivors have since become among the loudest advocates for stronger gun laws, spurring a social media movement with the hashtag #NeverAgain. Their activism has led to the creation of the student-led demonstration, March for our Lives.About 200 people work at Henry Pratt, which is owned by Atlanta-based Mueller Water Products.""Our hearts are with the victims and their loved ones, the first responders, the Aurora community and the entire Mueller family during this extremely difficult time,"" the company said in statement.Aurora shares a name with a Denver suburb that endured a mass shooting almost seven years ago. A gunman, James Holmes, opened fire inside a movie theater in 2012, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. The similarity was not lost on Nick Metz, the police chief of Aurora, Colorado.""Months from now as people talk about the mass shooting in Aurora, someone will ask, 'Which Aurora mass shooting are we talking about?'"" he said on Twitter.- - -The Washington Post's Michael Brice-Saddler, Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, Reis Thebault, Mark Berman, Alice Crites and Julie Tate contributed to this report.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

The Supreme Court on Fridayasked 10 statesto take ""prompt action"" to stop these incidents.From West Bengal to Jammu, several Kashmiri students and businessmen have complained of being harassed or beaten up. Hundreds have returned to Kashmir to escape persecution.Till thePrime Minister's address today, no senior BJP leader had issued a full-throated condemnation of these attacks. However, the party's allies, theShiromani Akali Daland the Shiv Sena, had denounced them.Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, asked about an outrageous comment by Meghalaya governor and former BJP leader Tathagata Roybacking the social boycott of Kashmiris, was curt in his response: ""I don't agree with his tweet. Matter ends there.""Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah responded to the Prime Minister's words:It's been a more than a week since the terrible attack in Pulwama & more than a week that Kashmiris have been bearing the brunt of the public anger. Perhaps finally after PM@narendramodiSb has spoken these forces targeting Kashmiris will stop in their tracks.Though the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir was claimed by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed, the suicide bomber was a man who lived just 10 km from the spot.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

US Drug Czar Uttam Dhillon Welcomes El Chapo's Conviction,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-drug-czar-uttam-dhillon-welcomes-mexican-drug-kingpin-el-chapo-guzmans-conviction-1993273,"Guzman, 61, was found guilty on all 10 counts at his high-profile drug-trafficking trial at a federal court in New York on Tuesday.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2018-11/r07mrh4o_el-chapo-trial_625x300_05_November_18.jpg,"The conviction of Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman in all 10 criminal charges against him clearly demonstrates that the US will not tolerate those who bring drugs and violence into the country to destroy people's lives, America's drug czar Uttam Dhillon has said.Guzman, 61, was found guilty on all 10 counts at his high-profile drug-trafficking trial at a federal court in New York on Tuesday.The Mexican, famed for his brazen escapes from Mexican prisons, was accused of being behind the all-powerful Sinaloa drug cartel, which prosecutors say was the biggest supplier of drugs to the US.He was convicted on numerous counts including the distribution of cocaine and heroin, illegal firearms possession and money laundering.In 2009, Guzman entered Forbes' list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of USD 1 billion.While Guzman will be sentenced on June 25, he faces a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole for leading a continuing criminal enterprise, and a sentence of up to life imprisonment on the remaining drug counts.US District Judge Brian Cogan confirmed the verdicts with each of the eight women and four men on the jury, telling them later their conduct on the panel ""made me very proud to be an American.""After jurors left the room, Guzman waved and smiled at his wife, Emma Coronel, a former beauty queen and courtroom regular who smiled back and touched her hand to her heart.Guzman was arrested in January 2016 after escaping from a Mexican prison through a tunnel five months earlier. He was extradited to the US in 2017.The Acting Administrator of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Dhillon said Guzman's conviction demonstrates the dedication and determination of the men and women of the DEA to bring the world''s most dangerous and prolific drug trafficker to justice.""Those who bring drugs and violence into the United States that destroy lives and communities will not be tolerated, nor evade our reach,"" the prominent Indian-American White House lawyer who was appointed in July last year, said.""The success of this case is a testament to the strength of our relationship with our Mexican counterparts. The DEA will continue to pursue justice worldwide and protect Americans,"" Dhillon said.A federal jury in Brooklyn convicted Guzman of being a principal operator of a continuing criminal enterprise - the Mexican organised crime syndicate known as the Sinaloa Cartel - a charge that includes 26 drug-related violations and one murder conspiracy.Guzman was convicted of all 10 counts of a superseding indictment, including narcotics trafficking, using a firearm in furtherance of his drug crimes and participating in a money laundering conspiracy, the Department of Justice said in a press release.The verdict followed a 12-week trial, the court was told that Guzman oversaw the smuggling of narcotics to wholesale distributors in Arizona, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and elsewhere.The billions of illicit dollars generated from drug sales in the United States were then clandestinely transported back to Mexico.Guzman Loera also used ""sicarios"" or hit men, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence in Mexico to enforce Sinaloa's control of territories and to eliminate those who posed a threat to the Sinaloa Cartel, the statement said.Reacting to Guzman's conviction, Acting US Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said it was clear to the jury that the Mexican drug kingpin''s massive, multi-billion dollar criminal enterprise was responsible for flooding the streets of the United States with hundreds of tonnes of dangerous drugs.""This case demonstrated the extraordinary reach of the US government, our tenacity and commitment to pursuing kingpins like Guzman whom - if their power is unchecked - will, like Guzman, develop what for 25 years was an almost unstoppable capacity to move massive quantities of drugs into our country,"" Whitaker said.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

14 Aligarh Muslim University Students Charged With Sedition After Clash With BJP Activists,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/14-aligarh-muslim-university-students-charged-with-sedition-after-clash-with-bjp-activists-1993067,"The politician, Mukesh Kumar Lodi, claimed in his complaint to the police that he and his associates were shot at and assaulted by AMU students outside the campus main gate because their motorcycles sported BJP stickers. Students have denied the charge.",https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-05/aligarh-muslim-university_650x400_61462275994.jpg,"The Uttar Pradesh police today charged 14 students of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)with seditionafter a local BJP leader alleged in a police complaint that they had indulged in violence and shouted anti-India slogans outside the main gate of the institution the previous day. Eight of these students have been suspended by the university pending inquiry.The politician, Mukesh Kumar Lodi, claimed in his complaint to the police that he and his associates were shot at and assaulted by AMU students outside the campus main gate because their motorcycles sportedBJP stickers. He also accused the students of shouting slogans favouring Pakistan over India in the course of the violence.University students had entered into a heated argument with the crew of Republic TV - a private television channel - after the latter tried to shoot a segment inside the campus allegedly in violation of institution regulations on Tuesday. AMU students have accused the mediapersons of trying to shoot inside the campus without obtaining requisite permissions, and misbehaving with campus security personnel and university officials upon being advised against doing so.The Republic TV crew has filed a separate complaint with the police, alleging that they were assaulted and threatened by AMU students before being thrown out of the campus.Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti weighed in on the matter soon after, criticising the manner in which the controversial anti-sedition law was being freely implemented under the BJP rule. ""Slapping sedition laws against AMU students for arguing with the Republic TV crew is ridiculous. The law can be invoked only when any individual tries to excite dissatisfaction towards the centre. Since when did R-TV start representing the government?"" she asked.Tensions rose after the students were booked under the sedition law, and news agency PTI reported that internet services will be suspended in the city as a precautionary measure. Rapid Action Force personnel were deployed around the campus amid protests, and a motorcycle belonging to an ABVP member was set afire, the news agency quoted a senior police officer as saying.

Koregaon-Bhima Case: Top Court Sets Aside Order On Chargesheet Extension,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/koregaon-bhima-case-top-court-sets-aside-bombay-high-court-order-on-chargesheet-extension-1992831,The Maharashtra government had on October 25 last year moved the supreme court challenging the High Court order.,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-01/5l1m7d78_supreme-court-_625x300_23_January_19.jpg,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Bombay High Court order refusing to grant 90 days extension to Maharashtra Police for filing the charge sheet in the Koregaon-Bhima violence case.The apex court, however, said the five rights activists may now seek regular bail in the case as the Maharashtra Police has already filed the charge sheet.A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had earlier stayed the Bombay High Court order which had set aside the trial court decision to extend time by 90 days for filing the charge sheet by the state police in the case.The arrested activists had been alleging that they were entitled for grant of default bail in the case as the Maharashtra Police did not file the charge sheet within the stipulated 90 days period and moreover, the extension granted by the trial court was bad in law.The Pune Police had arrested lawyer Surendra Gadling, Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen, Dalit activist Sudhir Dhawale, activist Mahesh Raut and Kerala native Rona Wilson in June for their alleged links with Maoists under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA.The top court had on January 10 reserved its verdict on the Maharashtra government's appeal challenging the refusal of the Bombay High Court to extend the 90-day limit for filing the charge sheet in the case.The court had earlier asked as to why the local court at Pune sat on a Sunday to decide the plea of the police seeking extension of time for filing the charge sheet against arrested rights activists.The court was told that the state police had filed an application seeking extension of time by 90 more days for filing the charge sheet on August 30, 2018. The 90 days period was expiring on September 3.But, the trial court took up the case for hearing on September 2, a Sunday, and extended the time for filing the charge sheet by another 90 days which disentitled the arrested accused from getting the statutory bail.The apex court had stayed the Bombay High Court order. The charge sheet has already been filed by the state police before a local court in the case.The Maharashtra government had on October 25 last year moved the apex court challenging the High Court order.Prior to this, the top court had refused to interfere with the arrest of five rights activists by the Maharashtra Police in connection with the Koregaon-Bhima violence case and declined to appoint a SIT for probe into their arrest.The arrests had followed raids at their residences and offices in connection with the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31,2017, which, the police claimed, had led to violence at Bhima Koregaon the next day.Under the UAPA, a charge sheet must be filed within 90 days of arrest. However, the prosecutor can file a report before the trial court, explaining the reasons for the delay and seek more time. If satisfied, the court can extend the time by 90 days.In the present case, the Pune sessions court had granted the police the additional 90 days, following an application from the investigating officer (IO) and written submissions by an assistant commissioner of police (ACP).The petition filed in the top court by the state government had said the investigating officer had filed an application in the trial court under his signature giving reasons for extension of time on August 30, 2018.""On the very same day, the public prosecutor submitted her report/application carving out the grounds for extension of time.The public prosecutor, by way of abundant precaution, took signature of the investigating officer. But the HC was carried away by the fact of signature of the investigating officer and arrived at a conclusion that the report/application was not by the public prosecutor,"" the plea had said.It had also said that the high court should not have been carried away by the fact of mentioning of names of parties in detail.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

It's a woman. She's currently in custody,"" Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said from the scene on Tuesday morning.The blaze left around 30 people -- including six firefighters -- with injuries.An investigation has been opened into the criminal charge of causing death by arson.The fire started at about 1:00 am (0000 GMT) and was finally brought under control more than five hours later by around 200 firefighters.Fire service spokesman Captain Clement Cognon told AFP at the scene overnight that ""the toll could still increase"" because firefighters were yet to search the upper floors of the eight-storey block, ""where the fire was the most violent"".Some of those affected scrambled on to nearby roofs to escape the smoke and flames.The residential neighbourhood lies on the edge of the vast Bois de Boulogne park and close to the stadium of football club Paris Saint-Germain, the Parc des Princes.Captain Cognon added: ""We had to carry out many rescues, notably for around a dozen people who had taken refuge on the roofs. In total about 50 people were evacuated by firefighters, including through the installation of ladders.""Two adjacent buildings were also evacuated as a precaution.Two adjacent buildings were also evacuated as a precaution and local officials were on site to help find housing for residents who could not return to their homes.Several streets were cordoned off by police and fire crews, and an AFP journalist said a strong smell of smoke hung in the air.The blaze follows a fire caused by a powerful gas explosion last month that killed four people in the city's central 9th arrondissement.In late December, two women and two girls died from asphyxiation in a fire that broke out in a public housing block in a suburb northeast of Paris.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.
