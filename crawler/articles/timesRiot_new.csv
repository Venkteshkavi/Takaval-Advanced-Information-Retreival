In November last year, HC had dismissed 22-year-old appeals of 70 out of 88 people convicted and awarded five-year jail term for rioting, looting and burning houses in Trilokpuri during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots . Justice R K Gauba had noted that the looting and arson cases indicate the way law and order machinery broke down during the 1984 riots and advocated reforms in criminal law to deal with such matters. “The case at hand, as observed elsewhere in this judgment, may be treated as a paradigm which ought not to be followed in cases of such nature. The law and order machinery had broken down. The police forces, and the civil administration, did not take timely or effective action to prevent the riotous conditions from spiralling out of hand,” HC observed in a strongly-worded judgment. It had noted how “these cases have continued to linger in the courts at the stage of trial or appeals or revisions till date”, which indicated that “the response of the law has been tardy, ineffective and highly unsatisfactory.” Of the remaining 19 people, 16 died during the pendency of their appeals against the trial court’s August 27, 1996 decision. The court found general criminal law “proven ill-equipped” to deal with the challenge of such crimes calling for reforms in the judicial process to effectively deal with the cases of communal riots, “which are engineered, more often than not, by those who have clout or influence — of various kinds.” HC underlined that after each event of communal riots, allegations of political influences having worked as the root cause or for protection of those responsible have surfaced. “Perhaps, there can be no two opinions about the fact that a sense of neutrality in the investigative and prosecution process has to be injected. And, towards this end, the possibility of entrusting such tasks to authorities other than normal agencies of the state needs to be explored,” the court suggested. The court also suggested amendments in key laws, adding that, “the law on the subject of communal riots cannot be a complete answer to the challenge unless it also establishes special courts with suitable amendments to the general criminal law procedure as indeed the rules of evidence.” ",01 May 2019,2019-05-01 02:17:27
"Supreme Court acquits 7 men convicted of arson, violence in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case","Supreme Court acquits 7 men convicted of arson, violence in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sc-acquits-7-men-convicted-of-arson-violence-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots-case/articleshow/69121353.cms,en,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 35 years after their alleged involvement in violence and arson during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the Supreme Court on Tuesday reversed concurrent judgments of the trial court and Delhi high court and acquitted seven persons who were sentenced to five years in jail. Appearing for the convicts, senior advocate R Basant and advocate V Raghunath told a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna that they were picked up randomly by police for violating curfew imposed after the rioting and that there was no evidence to link them to rioting or arson. The trial court in 1996 had convicted 88 people on these charges and the Delhi HC had in November last year upheld their conviction and sentence while asking them to surrender and undergo rigorous imprisonment. The SC on Tuesday took up appeals of seven of the 88 convicts. Referring to the prosecution evidence, the CJI-led bench said it unhesitatingly took the view that the prosecution witnesses have neither identified the accused nor placed any evidence against them before the court. “It is a classic case of no evidence against the accused,” the bench said and ordered their acquittal from the case. Appearing for the prosecution, additional solicitor general Pinky Anand suggested that in a case involving many accused, the prosecution should be permitted to apply ‘mechanical test’ to produce evidence against key persons to rope in others who were accompanying them. But, the SC said it did not see how the mechanical test would help the prosecution when it was a case of ‘no evidence at all’. “The offence alleged against the accused is rioting. But without any evidence and their identification by the witnesses, they cannot be convicted,” it said. ",01 May 2019,2019-05-01 00:06:14

Justice AK Chawla asked the Delhi government to decide on Khokhar's plea within two weeks after the end of the ongoing Lok Sabha election. The direction came after the Delhi government told the court that due to enforcement of the model code of conduct during elections, prisoners cannot be released during the poll period. Khokhar has sought a parole to file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi high court order of December 17, 2018. The high court on December 17 last year had set aside the trial court's verdict, which acquitted Kumar in a case related to killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar Part-I area in Palam Colony in South West Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II during that period. The riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards. The high court, in its verdict, had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by the trial court to the other five -- Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and former MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. It had also convicted them for criminal conspiracy to burn down residences of Sikh families and a gurdwara in the area during the riots. The trial court in 2013 had awarded life term to Balwan Khokhar, Bhagmal and Lal, and a three-year jail term to Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. Following the high court verdict, life term of Balwan Khokhar, Bhagmal and Lal has been upheld and the sentence of Yadav and Kishan Khokar has been enhanced to 10 years in jail. The high court, in its judgement, had said that the riots were a ""crime against humanity"" perpetrated by those who enjoyed ""political patronage"" and aided by an ""indifferent"" law enforcement agency.

The prisoners entered into a ruckus, when the officials conducted an intensive check for ganja . It is said that the prisoners were undressed to check their anus, where they usually hide small packets of ganja. Angered by this, a section of prisoners scaled up on an unused building and hurled stones at the security personnel and motorists on the New Jail Road, forcing the city police to suspend traffic for a couple of hours. A few of them even inflicted themselves with injuries to deter the police and prison authorities from approaching them. A judicial team led by secretary of district legal aid services authority T Panneerselvam held an inquiry with the prison authorities and inmates which lasted till late on Tuesday night. Meanwhile, the Karimedu police booked the inmates under sections of the Indian Penal Code and Prisons Act based on a complaint from head constable attached with the Karimedu police station P Balasubramanian.

However, he quickly added, “Do you think I am a terrorist. In 1984, I was the one who resigned from both my seat of Parliament and party.” Asked about his reaction to the PM’s comment, “Modi can say anything, Modi says everything you can’t accept. These are signs of desperation.” The CM was speaking to mediapersons after addressing a rally in support of Congress candidate Chaudhary Santokh Singh following filing of nomination papers. On Modi’s accusation that the Congress gave tickets to suspects of November 1984 killings, Amarinder said, “I can’t comment whether something had happened to this extent that if anybody was involved, in that as far as I remember, nobody was taken in. But if somebody has been taken now I don’t know. I had left in those days. I only came back (to the Congress) in 1994 and in that period I didn’t see anybody.” In a recent interview, Modi had called 1984 massacre an act of terror and had said that those who were involved were made MPs and cabinet ministers in Rajiv Gandhi’s government. He had also pointed a finger at Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath. Sandhvi Pragya has been fielded from MP capital Bhopal. Attacking BJP for picking up Sadhvi as candidate, Amarinder said, “These are the type of people they are picking and that is the tragedy for us. You are going to pick people against whom terrorism case is still going on. That (the case) is not over and how can you pick up a person like this. Where is the law of this country, where is the Constitution.” ",23 Apr 2019,2019-04-23 00:00:00

Journalist shot dead during riots in Northern Ireland,Journalist shot dead during riots in Northern Ireland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/journalist-shot-dead-in-norther-ireland-in-terrorist-incident/articleshow/68955101.cms,en,"DERRY: A journalist was shot dead during riots in Northern Ireland in what police on Friday were treating as a terrorist incident following the latest upsurge in violence to shake the troubled region. ""Lyra McKee was murdered during orchestrated violence in Creggan last night,"" assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton said in a statement. McKee, 29, had earlier posted an image that appeared to be from the riots in the Creggan housing estate in the city of Londonderry, also known as Derry, accompanied by the words ""Derry tonight. Absolute madness."" Images of the unrest posted on social media showed a car and van ablaze and hooded individuals throwing petrol bombs and fireworks at police vehicles. ""A single gunman fired shots in a residential area of the city and as a result wounded Ms McKee,"" said Hamilton, adding that police believed the gunman was a ""violent dissident republican"". ""We are treating this as a terrorist incident and we have launched a murder enquiry,"" he added. McKee had written for The Atlantic magazine and Buzzfeed News and was named by Forbes Magazine in 2016 as one of their ""30 under 30"" outstanding figures in media, according to her literary agent Janklow & Nesbit. Leona O'Neill, a reporter with the Belfast Telegraph , said she saw McKee get hurt. ""I was standing beside this young woman when she fell beside a police Land Rover tonight in Creggan #Derry. I called an ambulance for her but police put her in the back of their vehicle and rushed her to hospital where she died. Just 29 years old. Sick to my stomach tonight,"" she tweeted. Thursday's unrest raised memories of past decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned that ""we cannot allow those who want to propagate violence, fear and hate to drag us back to the past"". His British counterpart Theresa May said the killing was ""shocking and truly senseless"". In Brussels, a European Commission spokesman condemned the ""terrible incident"". ""We condemn such violence, and we are confident that the UK authorities will ascertain the exact circumstances of this tragic event,"" he said. Visiting US house of representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi joined in a minute's silence for McKee, saying it was ""especially poignant"", being held on Good Friday. The violence came in the run-up to the Easter weekend, when Republicans opposed to the British presence in Northern Ireland mark the anniversary of a 1916 uprising against British rule. A car-bombing and the hijacking of two vans in Londonderry earlier this year were also blamed on a dissident paramilitary group. Michelle O'Neill, the deputy leader of Irish republican party Sinn Fein, condemned the killing. ""My heart goes out to the family of the young woman shot dead by so-called dissidents,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""This was an attack on the community, an attack on the peace process and an attack on the Good Friday Agreement,"" the peace deal that largely brought an end to violence on the island exactly 21 years ago, she added, calling for calm. Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Union Party, which is in favour of Britain's presence in Northern Ireland, described the death as ""heartbreaking news"". ""A senseless act. A family has been torn apart. Those who brought guns onto our streets in the 70s, 80s & 90s were wrong. It is equally wrong in 2019. No one wants to go back,"" she wrote on Twitter. The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 largely brought an end to three decades of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland between republican and unionist paramilitaries, as well as British armed forces, in a period known as ""the Troubles"". Some 3,500 people were killed in the conflict — many at the hands of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Police have blamed a group called the New IRA for the flare-up in violence in recent months. Some have expressed fears that recent attacks could be a sign that paramilitaries are seeking to exploit the current political turbulence over Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland caused by Brexit. Londonderry was the scene of one of the darkest episodes in the Troubles in 1972, known as Bloody Sunday, when British troops opened fire on a civil rights demonstration and killed 13 people. A 14th victim later died of his wounds. A former British soldier was charged with murder last month over the killings. ",19 Apr 2019,2019-04-19 00:00:00

Former chief minister Suresh Mehta Thursday launched a Gujarati translation of Sreekumar's book, ""Gujarat: Behind the Curtain,"" at a function at Veer Narmad Library here. The original English version had come out in January 2016. ""As many as fourteen translators declined to translate the book into Gujarati. One translator even said that working on it was like keeping a snake. Some returned the book two days after reading it, saying they cannot do this,"" Sreekumar said. ""I was keen to get it published in Gujarati because the content of the book concerned the people of Gujarat, but bringing it in Gujarati was most difficult,"" the former state Director General of Police said at the function. Finally, noted Dalit writer and poet Raman Vaghela agreed to render the book into Gujarati, said Sreekumar. Finding the publisher too was difficult, he said. Delhi-based Pharos Media has published the book, which has also been translated into Malayalam, Hindi and Urdu. The book talks about the 2002 Gujarat riots which were triggered by the death of 59 `kar-sevaks' in Godhra train burning incident, and the alleged subversion of criminal justice system that followed. Communal riots can not go on unless ""the authorities avoid implementation of the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to control and contain mass violence"", the book says. ""The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the Supreme Court had practically transformed into a team of defence lawyers for those behind the violence,"" he said at the launch.

While the thieves involved in two incidents have been arrested, the police are on the lookout for the suspects in the other incident.

This is for the first time that the tapes—crucial evidence—have been played in court, made possible because the prosecution finally sourced a tape recorder. Eight people were killed in police firing at the Dongri bakery during the 1993 riots . Then JCP (crime) RD Tyagi, who was indicted by the Justice Srikrishna Commission, and eight other cops were discharged in the case. Seven are still on trial (see graphic). Their version is that police firing was an act of self-defence, done after cops were shot at from the bakery’s terrace. On Tuesday, the prosecution had told judge UM Padwad that it could not find a tape recorder despite repeated efforts. Coming to the prosecution’s rescue a day later, a cop who’s part of the investigations managed to source it from a friend. After the first of two tapes brought was played for an hour, the third prosecution witness, a 70-year-old retired cop who was posted in the control room on the day of the firing on January 9, 1993, identified his voice on some of the messages. “The recording I heard was from that day,” he said. The audio messages, in Marathi, pertained to several instances of communal riots in south Mumbai. The witness had earlier stated that the day he had received a message from a mobile van in Pydhonie, there was firing on police on duty. The tape recorder, black with silver buttons, was brought out at 12.10pm, Wednesday. The court staff could get it working only 10 minutes later. Some of the messages relayed by cops on the spot were partially unclear, but overall the record had withstood the test of time. The first tape was taken out of a cassette case, the cover of which had Mohammed Rafi on it with the words ‘Anmol Ratan’. The tape’s contents gave a disturbing picture of the city in its darkest days. Cops posted in pickets in areas like Dongri, Agripada , and Pydhonie relayed information in tense and hurried voices about alleged mob violence, casualities and blazes. In one instance, messages about two bodies being found could be heard. In another, cops spoke about cars and tempos being set alight near Saat Rasta. A wireless operator could be heard telling a cop to stop yelling and to relay information in normal tones. The prosecution could not play only snatches of conversations relevant to the Suleman Bakery firing. The prosecutor told the court that attempts to rewind or forward the tape could cause it to get stuck. During cross examination by defence advocate Shrikant Shivade, the witness (retired cop) said he could not recollect if there was any message which said Pydhonie and Dongri should be handed over to the army. He said that while listening to wireless messages from Pydhonie, he could hear firing and shouting. He denied hearing messages relayed by cops telling the control room about an appeal for people to gather on the streets with weapons. The witness said police staff were overstressed and the riots were the biggest he witnessed. He also said the staff was insufficient to handle the barrage of messages received during the riot days. “Staff is insufficient even now,” he quipped. The retired cop said he could not recollect hearing any messages about causalities, but said he realised that the situation was going out of control. The trial will continue on April 26.

Kumar has challenged in the apex court the Delhi High Court verdict of December 17 last year that awarded him life imprisonment for the ""remainder of his natural life"" in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. 73 year old Kumar, who is lodged in jail, has also filed an application seeking bail. His bail application came up for hearing on Monday before a bench of Justices S A Bobde and S A Nazeer. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, opposed his plea saying it would be a ""travesty of justice"" if Kumar was granted bail as he is facing trial in another 1984 anti-Sikh riots case at Patiala House district court here. ""This is a gruesome offence of massacre of Sikhs. He (Kumar) was the leader and he was the kingpin of this,"" Mehta told the bench. The case in which Kumar was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment 's Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1 and 2, 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II. Anti-Sikh riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards. During the arguments, the counsel representing Kumar told the bench that a key witness in the case had earlier given four statements in which she had not named Kumar but later, she named the former Congress leader in her statement. ""How long he (Kumar) has been in jail?,"" the bench asked. To this, the counsel said Kumar is in jail for past over three months and during the adjudication of the trial, he was out on anticipatory bail and never misused the liberty. Mehta, however, told the bench about the circumstances in which Kumar was granted anticipatory bail and argued that a violent mob had gathered at Kumar's residence when CBI team had gone there during probe into the case. The bench was also told by one of the advocates that Kumar was a sitting MP in 1984 and several Sikhs were killed during the riots in his constituency. When Kumar's counsel referred to the merits of the case, the bench said: ""We do not know why you are inviting our attention to the facts of the case. ""Today, you (Kumar) are convicted by the high court. It is not a charge by police. We cannot treat it lightly."" During the hearing, when Mehta referred to the ongoing trial against Kumar in a case related to 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the bench asked, ""How many witnesses are yet to be examined?"". Mehta said the case is at the stage of recording of prosecution evidence and the apex court can ask the trial court to expedite it. The bench, however, asked the CBI to apprise it of the status of the ongoing trial in the case involving Kumar and listed his bail plea for hearing on April 15. Kumar had surrendered before a trial court here on December 31, 2018, to serve the sentence in pursuance of the high court's December 17 verdict. After his conviction in the case, Kumar had resigned from the Congress party. The CBI has recently told the top court that Kumar's plea seeking bail should be dismissed as he has a ""large political clout"" and is capable of ""influencing or terrorising"" witnesses in the case pending against him. The high court had convicted and sentenced Kumar to spend the remainder of his life in jail for the offences of criminal conspiracy and abetment in commission of crimes of murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony and defiling and destruction of a Gurdwara. It had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by a trial court to five others — former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and ex-MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. The high court had set aside the trial court's 2010 verdict which had acquitted Kumar in the case. ",08 Apr 2019,2019-04-08 00:00:00

His first venue, Ramraj town in Muzaffarnagar district, is barely 15km from Kabal town, where the bloodiest Jat-Muslim communal riots broke out during the Samajwadi Party regime in September 2013, ripping apart the social fabric of the area. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections held months later, BJP swept all 10 seats of the region in the first phase. His second was at Shivpur in Bulandshahr, 50km from Sayana, where a police inspector was shot by cow vigilantes in December leading to a national outcry. Drawing spirited responses from supporters in both rallies, Yogi went on to condemn Congress by saying no patriot and nationalist would vote for Congress as the party’s election manifesto had provisions that would “weaken security forces battling terrorists, secessionists and Maoists”. He also branded Samajwadi Party a sympathiser of terrorists and anti-Hindu. Yogi appealed to crowds to consolidate support for his party’s candidates in Bijnor and Bulandshahr by repeatedly raising issues of riots and “suppression of the feelings of majority community” by SP, BSP and Congress. He also blamed Congress president Rahul Gandhi for tying up in Kerala with the Muslim League, a party which he said was “responsible for India’s Partition”. Campaigning for BJP Bijnor candidate Kunwar Bhartendu Singh in Ramraj, Yogi reminded locals about the 2013 communal riots and said he found it “painful” that RLD chief Ajit Singh had sided with the SP and BSP, which were responsible for the violence. The BJP, on the other hand, would stand by the people always, Yogi assured the crowd during his 35-minute-long speech. In Bulandshahr, while campaigning for candidate Bhola Singh, Yogi had to face an awkward situation though. Party workers began hooting in front of Yogi in protest against the choice of candidate. However, Yogi salvaged the situation by repeatedly invoking the name of PM Modi , reiterating that the objective was to form a government at the Centre by voting for the lotus and not a particular person. Assuaged, the crowd roared with ‘Yogi, Yogi’ and ‘Yogi zindabad’ slogans soon after. Earlier in the day, Yogi addressed the public across the state border in Uttarakhand, where crowds climbed atop trees and buildings to catch a glimpse of the leader. Here too, Yogi attacked the Congress for joining hands with the Muslim League, and the SP- BSP alliance for giving shelter and protection to rioters and terrorists and for hurting the feelings of the majority community. He assured the crowd that with a BJP government, Hindus could be assured of peace and harmony. He also spoke of how then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had in 2006 declared that Muslims had the first right to the country’s resources and how the Modi government “would never let this happen as followed a policy of no appeasement”.

While the BJP gave Anand constituency ticket to Mitesh Patel alias Bakabhai, who was named as an accused in a rioting case in Vasad, Congress Dahod candidate Babu Katara’s son Bhavesh was named in a 2002 riot case in which four people were murdered. Katara, who was also a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) activist before joining politics, and his son Bhavesh had joined the Congress ahead of the 2017 assembly polls. In his election affidavit, Bhavesh, who is the sitting MLA from Jhalod, had declared that he was named as an offence in a 2002 loot with murder case registered by the Jhalod police station. He and others were booked for the murder of four persons on Banswada Road in Jhalod. The accused were allegedly involved in arson and loot too. Police had later filed a summary report in the case. It was one of the post-Godhra riot cases that the Supreme Court had ordered to be reopened. Bhavesh and other accused were arrested and, according to the affidavit, the case was pending in 2002. Bhavesh was also involved in a couple of other offences after the rioting case lodged on March 1, 2002. Babu himself was named as an accused in a case of cheating and impersonation after he tried to take a mother-son duo abroad on the passports of his wife and son. The affidavit filed by Babu states that charges are yet to be framed in the offence that was registered in 2007. He was suspended from the party subsequently. Bhavesh was keen on getting a ticket from Jhalod assembly seat in 2017 and had worked hard for the BJP, but was dropped at the last moment. Bhavesh rebelled against the BJP along with his father and contested successfully on a Congress ticket. Babu along with former Congress MP Dr Prabha Taviyad was the frontrunner for the ticket for the Dahod parliamentary constituency. The Congress formally announced his name as its candidate on Thursday, the last day of filing nominations. Babu had helped BJP make inroads into the constituency otherwise dominated by the Congress. He won on a BJP ticket in 1999 by 12,361 votes against Congress veteran Somji Damor and then by a wafer-thin margin of 361 votes against Taviyad in 2004. On the other hand, Patel, the chairman and managing director of Laxmi Protein Products Pvt Ltd that sells pulses under the Laxmi brand, was named as an accused in a arson and rioting case registered by the Vasad police station in 2002. He was acquitted in the case in 2010 by the Anand district court. An appeal against the acquittal has been filed in the Gujarat high court. Patel was also named as an accused in another rioting case in the Vasad police station in 2002, but the affidavit states that an ‘A Summary’ was filed regarding the offence and was approved by the court.

Kawaljit Singh Manu, member, SIT (Special Investiation Team) coordination committee, told TOI that the 85-year-old woman eyewitness, used to live in Shastri Nagar area of the city with her husband and two sons when the riots broke out in the morning of November 1, 1984. The woman, who did not want to reveal her identity, said that her account would help SIT in nailing down the perpetrators of 1984 anti-Sikh riots, who were still roaming. “Since SIT was formed, till date, we have 12 eyewitnesses, including the 85-year-old woman, who used to live in Shastri Nagar, when her husband suffered cardiac arrest on seeing their two sons being brutally assaulted by a mob on November 1, 1984.

A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Manoj Kumar Ohri said the appeal and the death reference of convict Yashpal Singh would be heard on daily basis till the conclusion of arguments. ""List for hearing on April 22. It is made clear that the hearing of the connected appeal and death reference shall be conducted on day to day basis till the conclusion of the arguments,"" the bench said in a recent order. The court had earlier sought response of the police on Yashpal's plea challenging his death sentence in the case. He has filed the appeal against his conviction and sentence by a trial court here. He has also filed a bail plea in the matter. The bench had also issued notice to Yashpal on the reference to confirm his death sentence. The trial court had also awarded life term to co-convict Naresh Sherawat in the case relating to the killing of two men in New Delhi during the 1984 riots -- the first convictions in the cases reopened by the Special Investigation Team (SIT). Naresh has also appealed against his conviction and sentence before the high court which has sought response of the police in the plea. The Delhi Police had closed the case in 1994 for want of evidence, but it was reopened by the SIT. The SIT is investigating nearly 60 cases related to the riots, while it has filed ""untraced report"" in 52 cases. While this was the first death penalty after the SIT was formed, one Kishori was earlier given the death penalty by a trial court in as many as seven anti-Sikh riots cases. However, the Delhi high court confirmed death penalty only in three cases, which were later commuted to life term by the apex court. As per the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the death penalty cannot be executed unless confirmed by the high court. The trial court had awarded varying jail terms to the convicts and imposed fines for offences including attempt to murder, dacoity and attacking victims by dangerous weapons. It had spared convict Naresh the gallows on medical grounds. Earlier, the trial court had convicted Yashpal and Naresh for killing Hardev Singh and Avtar Singh in Mahipalpur area of South Delhi on November 1, 1984 during the riots that had taken place after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at her residence by two Sikh bodyguards a day before. The case was lodged on a complaint by victim Hardev's brother Santokh Singh. The trial court had held both the accused guilty for the offences of murder, attempt to murder, dacoity and voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means under the IPC. A mob of about 500 persons, led by the two convicts, had encircled the house of the victims and had killed them. It was just one of the incidents out of several others Delhi alone witnessed during the riots that saw around 3,000 people being killed. Of the 650 cases registered in connection with the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, 267 were closed as untraced by the Delhi Police. Of these 267 cases, five were later taken up by the CBI. The SIT also scrutinised records of 18 cancelled cases. ",01 Apr 2019,2019-04-01 00:00:00

His petition is likely to be mentioned Tuesday for urgent hearing and his lawyers would seek stay of the March 29 order of the High Court which is coming in the way of his contesting the Lok Sabha election . Patel, 25, had started preparations to contest from Jamnagar on a Congress ticket after joining the party on March 12 and the last date for filing of nominations is April 4. Polling for 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat will be held on April 23. The Sessions Court at Visnagar in Mehsana district sentenced Patel to two years' imprisonment last July for rioting and arson in Visnagar town in 2015 during the Patidar quota stir which he led. The high court in August 2018 suspended the sentence but not the conviction. Under the Election Law — Representation of the People Act and a related Supreme Court ruling — a convict facing a jail term of two years or more cannot stand for election unless the conviction is stayed. In the high court, the state government had submitted that there were 17 FIRs including two sedition complaints against Patel who is known for making inflammatory speeches. The high court had declined the contention of Patel's lawyers that if the conviction was not stayed, it will cause ""irreparable damage"" as he intended to contest the Lok Sabha election. In the order, the high court noted that a conviction can be stayed only in rare and exceptional cases, and the case did not fall into that category. ",01 Apr 2019,2019-04-01 00:00:00

With Gujarat going to polls on April 23, it is a race against time for Hardik as his only hope now is to challenge the HC order in Supreme Court. With the last date for filing nomination in Gujarat on April 4, he is left with time until 3 pm on Thursday next. Hardik, who recently joined Congress, will reach Delhi shortly to seek legal counsel from party leader Kapil Sibal . ""He will canvass against BJP in Gujarat and across the country in case he does not get legal nod to file nomination in time,"" said Jayesh Patel, a close aide. Hardik tweeted: ""My only mistake is that I refused to bow down to the BJP. Elections may come and go, but the BJP is working against the Constitution."" A local court had convicted Hardik for vandalising a BJP MLA's office in July 2015 during one of the first quota rallies by the Patidars taken out under his leadership.

Both Shiv Sena and MIM have a single point agenda—of spreading hatred for political gains,” said Zambad while addressing media persons here. Declaring that he would file his nomination papers on Monday, the MLC said he was not bothered about who was pitched against him. “Our party had lost the previous Lok Sabha elections due to certain weaknesses in the rural areas. This time, we have revived the party cadre both in the urban and rural areas,” said Zambad. Training guns on sitting MP Chandrakant Khaire, Zambad said that the Shiv Sena leader had no vision for development. “What good has the sitting MP done for the city in the last four terms? The city has huge potential in the tourism and industrial sectors. The sitting MP has not done anything to boost tourism or fetch industries at the upcoming DMIC project. Neither did he bother about the water issues in the city, nor paid heed to the woes of the farmers,” he said. Zambad also criticised rebel Sena MLA from Kannad Harshawardhan Jadhav, who is also in the poll fray, describing him as a ‘passive’ public representative. “Voters from Kannad are blaming him for no development. He should pay attention to his home town first instead of fighting the Lok Sabha polls,” he said. That Zambad will be filing nominations as a Congress candidate on Monday has put to rest all speculations that the party top-brass may consider alloting the ticket to rebel Sillod MLA Abdul Sattar. Incidentally, during Friday’s rally, Sattar had tried to gauge mandate for the option of contesting the elections as an independent candidate— an option that did not go well with his supporters. Sattar had told media persons that he would have a word with MPCC chief Ashok Chavan again, giving rise to speculations that the party may rethink the candidature of Zambad. When asked about the stand taken by Sattar so far, Zambad said, “The Congress has rewarded him (Sattar) profusely so far and if he has any gratitude, he should support my campaign as I am the official candidate.” ",01 Apr 2019,2019-04-01 00:00:00

When my husband pleaded before them to spare their sons, they mercilessly thrashed him too folowing which he suffered cardiac arrest and died later. Thereafter, the mob plundered and looted valuables from my house. It took away everything from our house including spoons and our clothing”, she said and added, “At every house, the mob was looking for people belonging to the Sikh community.” When she went to the local police station to lodge a report, the police refused and instead threatened her saying that she would also meet the same fate, she alleged. “The cops tried to intimidate me saying the people whom I was naming were influential persons and the police would not be able to give her security,” she said.

The committee was also able to convince three eyewitnesses of the riots, who had migrated to other states in fear, to come and record their statements, reports Faiz Siddiqui. “The booklet ‘Sikh Virodhi Dange — Kanpur Ki Report — Doshi Kaun?’ was compiled by a Sikh activist in the aftermath of 1984 anti-Sikh riots. We have been looking for it all these years as it contains vital details of the Sikh families or individuals murdered or looted by mob in the riots after the assassination of Indira Gandhi. We found it in the possession of Jammu resident Kamaljeet Singh,” Kawaljeet Singh Manu, a member of SIT coordination committee, told TOI. “The booklet also contains the names of nearly 250 rioters and those leading and provoking the mob. We will go through each and every minute detail in the booklet and prepare a fresh report and thereafter produce it in court, besides sharing it with SIT,” he added. “We also managed to convince three other eyewitnesses, who used to live in the city, but later migrated to Jamshedpur (Bihar), Jammu and Punjab out of fear of being targeted. On our request, they all came to Kanpur to record their statements before SIT to make the case strong against the perpetrators of crime,” he said.

Thanks to the Cambridge Analytica controversy, they are embracing ‘user-owned’ platforms where they feel more safe and are less likely to be subtly manipulated by a political party or corporate. In most of these platforms — Diaspora, Riot, Riseup.net, Proton mail – users’ rights over their data are intact. In fact, some platforms allow users to edit source code and add a layer of protection to further secure their information. The youngsters are talking about Diaspora, Riot and Riseup at a time when Facebook is under a fresh attack after it was revealed that the social networking giant knew about Cambridge Analytica using users’ data earlier than what it had claimed. Many of them revealed their preferences on the sidelines of the conference ‘Technology for Democracy’, organized on Saturday in Hyderabad by Swechha, a non-profit organization. They said they were here to raise their voice against what they called the “surveillance economy which is killing democracy”. More than 1,000 people, mostly under 30 years, participated in the event. Millenials of city see data as a resource that needs protection Naveen C, a third-year engineering student of CMR College of Engineering & Technology says, “no one knows my interests or likes on these platforms and there is no way anyone can influence me by sharing only a particular type of information.” Naveen is critical of sites like Facebook. “It creates a bubble and keeps us in an illusion,” he says. “If I am sensitive towards farmers, I will only get information on schemes related to farmers from a political party and at the end, I will be voting for them even without realising that I was manipulated.” Users on these platforms say decentralization of data is an important factor which is bringing them towards these sites. “Unlike foreign-based companies, data is not placed in one location here. It is decentralised and gives me an option of what to share and who to share it with,” says Maithreie K, a student of Sridevi Women's Engineering College. “No Tom, Dick, and Harry can even create an account in sites like Riseup as it needs an invite from an existing user who is at least three months old on the platform.” Many of them say that the result of 2016 presidential election in the United States, where fake posts and ads on social media platforms were used to sharpen divides between people, and the Cambridge Analytica controversy was a wake-up call for them. “Privacy is the least concern for many classic social media sites. Having access to peoples’ caste, creed and religion, their likes and dislikes and playing on their sentiments can be adverse,” says Sahithi, a techie. These millennials and first-time voters term data as a natural resource and add that soon everyone will realise that it is the most important asset they have that needs protection.

Chemical-laden colours and gulaal have caused severe allergic reactions in the eyes and skin besides causing breathing difficulties among many people. Several city doctors told TOI that around 70% patients , who came to them on Thursday and Friday, showed reactions to colours and side-effects of bhang. Senior medical officer at J P Hospital , Dr Saurabh Jain, said, “Around 900 people came to the OPD during the peak hours of Holi, from 12 pm to 8 pm, out of which more than 30% cases were related to allergies in eyes due to colour and respiratory disorders from inhaling gulaal and other sorts of colours. Many people also came with skin rashes and allergies due to chemical-based colours. Apart from this, around 40-50% cases were related to injuries and accidents caused to due to overconsumption of bhang and alcohol.” He added that about 600 out of 900 patients, who came in during the peak time, were Holi-related cases. Pulmonologist Dr P N Agrawal also said that many people suffering from respiratory problems had congestion in chest and trouble breathing while children suffering from asthma faced severe attacks due to cold water and inhaling powdered colour. “I felt that due to several campaigns related to a safe Holi, the number of Holi-related cases saw a decline as compared to last year, but even then, there were many people who had asthma attacks and had fever after playing Holi with cold water. People suffering from respiratory problems had chest congestion and trouble in breathing and wheezing,” Agrawal added. Dr Lokendra Dave also recounted similar cases and advised people to see the doctor immediately instead of trying home remedies before the infection worsens. “A number of patients try to treat the condition with home remedies, thinking that it is not something major and will go away in a day or two. This kind of lax attitude causes the infections to worsen. Many such cases will reach the hospitals and private doctors in a day or two,” said Dave. Agrawal also advised people suffering from respiratory troubles to drink warm water and go for stream inhalation for relief. Dermatologist Akhilesh Agrawal, who has attended to more than 10 patients since Thursday suffering from skin allergies and rashes caused due to colours, said: “There are no guidelines to make colours and many manufacturers use industrial dye and metals to manufacture colours that cause rashes, redness, irritation and itching on the skin. Besides, people use volatile substances like kerosene, petrol etc to remove the colour which further irritates the affected area. Friction with cloth while rubbing also increases dermatitis,” he said. “Applying petroleum jelly or coconut oil before exposing the skin to colours reduces the level of penetration and can prevent allergies.” “In Bhopal , the percentage of people suffering from skin allergies caused due to Holi colours has reduced as people are now more aware and use non-allergic and herbal colours during the festival,” he added.

The CBI submited its reply in response to the bail application filed by Sajjan Kumar in the Supreme Court . Kumar was awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi high court on December 17, 2018 and is now in jail. Phoolka also released Para 3 of the CBI’s reply, which reads: “The present appeal arises in reference to a ghastly incident that occurred on the morning of 31st October 1984 in Delhi, subsequent to which thousands of Sikhs were brutally murdered and their houses vandalised. The killings had taken place in pursuance to the provocative speeches made by the applicant/convict against the Sikh community. The killing of five innocent Sikhs in this case was not a revengeful act but had taken place due to the hatred disseminated, spread by the applicant, convict against the Sikhs. The brutal murder of innocent Sikhs during the 1984 riots falls under the category of crimes against the humanity on parity with well known genocides worldwide like large scale killing of Armenians by Kurds and Turks, mass extermination of Jews by Nazis, mass killing of Bangladeshi citizens by the sympathizers of Pakistani army and mass killing during various ethnic riots within India also. In this case, the minority community was targeted by the spearheaded attacks of the dominant political actors like the applicant/convict and duly facilitated by the law enforcement agencies. As such, this case has to be viewed in the larger context of mass crimes and requires a different approach than a case of normal murder/ rioting.” Phoolka informed that the bail application of Kumar was now listed before SC for March 25.

Nor were there any incident of acid attacks or kidnapping,"" he claimed. Though there has been no major communal violence in Uttar Pradesh during the past two years, a mob of 400 people, including right-wing activists, had fought pitched battles with police in Bulandshahr district in December last year. The violence in Siana area of Bulandshahr happened apparently after right-wing activists were angered by the discovery of cow carcasses strewn in a nearby jungle. In January last year, a 22-year-old youth was shot dead during a ""Tiranga Yatra"" by some people after which a series of violent incidents and arsoning had taken place in Kasganj. Taking lesson from it, the state government that year denied permission for any such procession on Independence Day in the western Uttar Pradesh city.

""However"", he said, ""today peace has returned as well as the traders who had fled from there."" The exodus of Hindus from Kairana was a major poll issue for BJP in the 2017 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh.

According to sources, absconding gangster Sushil Mooch runs a racket through his sons, including Tony. They take money from the accused and try to strike an out-of-court compromise with the victims in the crime-prone region. Muzaffarnagar SSP Sudhir Kumar said: “Choudhary is one of the aides of Sushil Mooch. Tony, Mooch’s son had tried to strike a compromise in the case, which had failed.” Police have announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh on any information leading to the arrest of Mooch. He is wanted in several cases of murder and robbery . Apart from Tony and Choudhary, four more persons -- who were also named in the charge-sheet of the riot case -- have been named in the murder of Ashbab. “A manhunt is on to nab others,” the SSP said. His lawyer, Nasir Ali told TOI that Ashbab was getting threats and had even approached police with a complaint in February. “All the six accused are out on bail now. Ashbab was the key witness in the case, and its next hearing is on March 25. He was being constantly pressurized to make compromise. Fearing that he will be killed, Ashbab had even approached police in February and filed a complaint,” Ali said. ",17 Mar 2019,2019-03-17 00:00:00

Vaghela and Kataria were arrested for rioting and arson and were also booked under the Arms Act for torching houses of Muslims on March 22, 2002, in Gomtipur area of Ahmedabad. They were later put on trial. Vaghela defended himself by claiming that a local Congress leader, Iqbal Shaikh, had been arrested in a case of rioting and therefore to build a balance, police arrested them as Hindu leaders. While acquitting the duo earlier this month by extending benefit of doubt for want of inadequate evidence, additional sessions judge V J Kalotara said that the police chargesheet showed in its Column No. 2 a mob of 2,000 Hindus whose names and addresses were not known. The court observed, “There was a mob of around 2,000 persons in this incident, but only two persons were arrested later. This raises doubt, because it is clearly established that police had reached the spot in time.” The court further said that there were police points set up in all four directions during the post-Godhra riots. Curfew was imposed and police bandobast was very heavy. “But not a single accused person was arrested and nobody’s name was revealed later. This is not believable,” the court commented and pointed out that there were only 15 witnesses and panch witnesses shown in this case, despite the fact that there were so many police personnel and local people available for testimonies. “This brings the prosecution’s case under the shadow of doubt,” the court added. The court noted that the rioting mob had torched properties belonging to Muslims. But a witness, Mohyuddin Pathan alias Safed Sher, whose house was burnt down, turned hostile. Other independent witnesses were found improvising during deposition and the court found their testimonies contradictory. The panch witnesses too turned hostile. In 2014, Vaghela were acquitted in another rioting case along with 43 others. ",19 Mar 2019,2019-03-19 00:00:00

Following the fracas, around 12 teachers and several parents have been booked for rioting, assault and unlawful assembly by Jaripatka police following the complaint by headmistress Pearl Michael. The accused teachers are identified as Sarika Karde, R Ghash, Baimal Joseph, Mamta Dandekar, Shivani Rao, Shiba Vinoi, V Kalsi, Khushali Raut, Devendra Hulke, Achatra Chanchlani, P Chavhan, Rohit Kachva along with some parents.

It is never heard of that a surprise test is conducted for students without even telling the class teacher. We are only being targeted and harassed because we stood against management’s decision,” added Hulke CEO and general secretary of Sikh education society Sarabjit Kalsi said, “We were concerned about the education of students as the exams are nearing. That is why we had decided to conduct the surprise test. We had even given letter to Hulke that such a test will be conducted as we suspected that he was not giving proper education to the students due to his other priorities.” “Our only concern is students and we want to give them best education that is why we had conducted the test, but the teachers and some parents created ruckus at the school,” added Kalsi.

Waste management and a riot of colours at Noida Flower Show,Waste management and a riot of colours at Noida Flower Show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/waste-management-and-a-riot-of-colours-at-noida-flower-show/articleshow/68138383.cms,en,"It was a riot of colours at the 33rd Noida Flower Show which opened in the city on Friday afternoon and concluded on Sunday. The theme of this year’s event was the flower Antirrhinum, and visitors were greeted by the same as soon as they entered the show. According to Noida Authority officials, the show has been a platform for many firsts. “For the first time, the Noida Flower Show is being promoted on social media. For the first time, a photography competition has also been organised here. Again, for the first time, the flower show will have drone surveillance as well,” said Rajiv Tyagi, General Manager, Noida Authority. Centerpieces become selfie points The first flower display in the middle of the show was an homage to martyred CRPF soldiers. Other displays included colourful flowers arranged in the form of a waterfall, peacock, elephant and other animals, and drew many children and selfie-clicking youngsters. “It is a bright, sunny day and colourful flowers make for a perfect picture. We read about the show in the newspaper today and decided to spend the evening here,” said Vishwendra Singh, a visitor at the flower show. Paths made with stones led to the entrance of several small parks – that were scattered around the venue – adorned with colourful flowers and wooden decorative items like a little hut, dwarfs, gnomes and even swings! “The miniature parks are made to attract curiosity among people and to show how parks are supposed to be, provided we maintain them. Planting bright and colourful flowers and taking care of them should be a community effort and that is what we want to teach people here,” said Manish Kumar, from the Floriculture Department of Noida Authority. Flower entries from around 20 different participants like Northern Railway, Hans Raj College, South and North Delhi Municipal Corporation and many others were also displayed at the show. The Noida Authority displayed how waste – including old water bottles, tyres and jeans – can be used to make decorative planters Waste-to-decor section floors visitors Taking a cue from the under-construction Shilp Haat in Sector 33, the Noida Authority displayed how waste – including old water bottles, tyres and jeans – can be used in the form of decorative planters and as solar huts too. The section also featured small fountains and a number of showpieces of aquatic animals and insects. “The wood used here is the waste wood which is acquired from factories like LG and Samsung where it is used for packaging and then discarded. We have created a solar hut that has a solar panel on one side and a vertical garden on the other. All this will be displayed at the Shilp Haat once the flower show is over,” said Tyagi. “Everywhere we look, there is some everyday item which has been used in a unique way. This has inspired me to follow suit. Old clothes have also been used here, which I’ve not seen before,” said Sarika Rawat, a visitor and resident of Sector 55. The stall selling bonsai plants was a crowd-pleaser, and also had a penjing display at the back Bonsai-making and Pejing at the show The stall selling bonsai plants was a crowd-pleaser, and also had a penjing display at the back. “Penjing is a form of scenery display through the use of stones and plants, which give the effect of mountains and trees in your own home,” said Saumik Das, the stall owner. The average height of the bonsai plants ranged between one and three feet, and the oldest one was a 57-year-old bonsai of a Banyan tree. “I am very fascinated by these plants and have bought two of these for my home. I also enquired about how to make these and found that I can sign up for bonsai-making classes as well,” said Ruchika Mehra, a resident of Sector 25. Compost-making Apart from stalls selling plants, planters and gardening equipment, one exhibit which garnered people’s attention was that of the compost-making setup for apartments. Compost generation through the use of permeable trays was being demonstrated to promote waste management. “Earlier, our grandmothers used to make compost in the backyard. However, flats don’t allow for this. so we’ve created a system through which the kitchen waste from the apartment of a family of four can be converted into compost within one month, which can be further used for gardening,” said Brig Amrit Kapur, from Citizens Environment Improvement Society. The demonstration generated interest among people as awareness regarding waste management has become paramount in the recent times. “I always thought that in order to make compost without a proper backyard, we need those machines which are available in the market. However, this system of using simple trays with some red worms is not just easy but cost-effective as well,” said Rita Mahajan, a resident of Sector 70. Air purifying, herbal plants Almost every stall at the flower show was banking on the popularity of air purifying plants which are in high demand considering the low air quality of the city. “Air purifying plants have always been in demand and will continue to be so because they can be put indoors and don’t require much care,” said Simmi, another stall owner. Herbal plants – especially basil, thyme and rosemary – were also selling like hot cakes at the flower show. “I watch a lot of European cooking shows and keep experimenting with my own food as well. We cannot always rely on the dried herbs which are available in the supermarket because the flavours that the fresh herbs emit is unmatchable. I had been looking for these type of potted herbs for a while now but ultimately found them at the flower show,” said Ranjana Kakkar, a resident of Indirapuram. Visitors clicked selfies with the flower displays that resembled animals Street Play, photography contest Apart from plant lovers at the event, some photography enthusiasts were also seen clicking pictures of the various kinds of flowers and plants on display at the show. “I love clicking nature and what better place to click bright, colourful flowers than the Noida Flower Show? I will also send some entries to the photography contest, hoping I may win!,” said Shivam Sethi, a resident of Kalindi Kunj . A street play performance was also held at the flower show which talked about environment sustainability and saving the girl child. Cultural performances by children also enthralled the audience during the evening. In Video: Riot of colours at the Noida Flower Show ",25 Feb 2019,2019-02-25 00:00:00

The court observed that the violence, which was an outcome of a mob protesting a murder, stemmed from an unlawful assembly that adopted non-peaceful means to protest. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Samar Vishal had no doubt that the assembly was unlawful as it caused traffic jam, besides indulging in violence, as part of a common intention. “Prosecution has proved all the three accused to be members of unlawful assembly and being involved in assaulting the police personnel,” the judge noted. The court held that Jarwal, Salim and Dharam Prakash were part of the assembly and assaulted police constables and an assistant sub-inspector. Besides, the violence also resulted in damage of a DTC bus and a few motorbikes. The three accused, therefore, were held guilty under the relevant provision of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The incident took place on August 30, 2013 when a mob of about 300 persons resorted to stone pelting. The protest was in retaliation to a murder and supposed inaction on the police’s part. A few members of the mob were allegedly provoking the rest to resort to violence. The mob, according to the case, did not pay heed to the police’s appeal to maintain peace, instead ripped off their uniform. Jarwal claimed innocence and took the plea of alibi saying he was not present at the crime scene, but attending to people’s queries at office. He also submitted that it was a political conspiracy against him to defame his image. Akin to Jarwal, the others, too, raised the plea of alibi. The court, however, found no reasons to discredit prosecution witnesses when the defense raised none. Besides, there was no delay in the registration of FIR and the names of accused had figured in the initial complaint itself. “They have been identified by the witnesses as being on the spot,” the court held. Arguments on the quantum of punishment will be heard on March 13. ",20 Feb 2019,2019-02-20 00:00:00

Justice Najmi Waziri issued notice to the AAP government on the petition in which the convict said he wanted parole for a month to file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the Delhi high court's December 17, 2018 verdict. The high court on December 17, 2018 had set aside the trial court's verdict which had acquitted Kumar in a case related to killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar Part-I area in Palam Colony in south west Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II during that period. The riots had broken out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards. The high court had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by the trial court to the other five -- Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and former MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. It had also convicted them for criminal conspiracy to burn down residences of Sikh families and a gurdwara in the area during the riots. The trial court in 2013 had awarded life term to Khokhar, Bhagmal and Lal, and a three-year jail term to Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. Following the high court verdict, life term of Khokhar, Bhagmal and Lal has been upheld and the sentence of Yadav and Kishan Khokar has been enhanced to 10 years in jail. The high court in its judgement had said that the riots were a ""crime against humanity"" perpetrated by those who enjoyed ""political patronage"" and aided by an ""indifferent"" law enforcement agency.

Talking to mediapersons at the circuit house here on Tuesday, the minister said there were reports that during anti-Sikh riots, some bureaucrats had not performed their duties in controlling the riots. ""It is quite surprising that after 1984 riots, no government did bother to touch the issue of mass killing of Sikhs in the city, and whatever they did, was just an eyewash, as later almost all the accused involved in the killings were given a clean chit"", Aulakh said. The SIT would probe the role of all accused in the riots who had been given clean chit by the previous state goverments, and if found guilty, would be punished, he added. The members of the Sikh community now hope to get justice after 34 years of the genocide, Aulakh claimed. ""The BJP-led state government is committed to provide justice to the 1984 riot victims who had lost their kin"", he said. Lauding the efforts of chief minister Yogi Adityanath for ordering an inquiry by the SIT in 1984 riots, Aulakh said, ""Please don't connect it with the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. We are just following instructions of the apex court which had sought information and the status of various cases related with the riots."" He said Kanpur was the second city after Delhi where large number of Sikhs were killed following assassination of former PM Indira Gandhi in 1984. When asked why the government is not considering to give a proper financial package to Sikhs as most of the riot accused are not alive, Aulakh said, ""the financial package is different, and giving justice to those who had lost their kin was something else. One cannot balance death of a person with weight of money"", he said. ",13 Feb 2019,2019-02-13 00:00:00

While 12 accused were acquitted in 2004, the five have remained absconding till date. In their absence, the court relied on the evidence from the previous trial and said there was discrepancy over the date on which the incident had occurred. Stating it was futile to keep the case pending, the court recalled the non-bailable warrants issued against the accused Harkisan Sarveya, Ashok Pardeshi, Dattaram More, Santosh Bendal and Raghunath Palkar. The case was registered by Dharavi police station in 1993. The prosecution told the court that in January 1993, communal riots were rife in the city. The prosecution said around 11.30pm on January 11, 1993, police noticed a mob of around 60 people near Kumbharwada kabrastan pelting stones and missiles towards a madrassa. The prosecution said the accused had the common object of destroying the madrassa and insulting religious sentiments. The prosecution further said police dispersed the mob by using lathi charge. During investigations, 22 accused were arrested and a chargesheet was filed. During the trial, the five accused, now discharged, absconded. The trial against them was separated and kept pending. One other accused died and the case against him was abated. On February 12, 2004, Sewri sessions court acquitted the other accused on trial. The court had then pointed out that most witnesses did not identify the accused. The court also held that except for the FIR and statement of one of the witnesses, there was absolutely no evidence to show that the incident took place on January 11, 1993, as claimed by the prosecution then.

TOI has accessed the recommendation note — prepared by special secretary J P Singh and under-secretary Arun Kumar Rai — that was sent to the Muzaffarnagar district magistrate a week ago. The riot cases deal with charges of dacoity, use of fire and explosive substances and defiling places of worship and outraging religious feelings. Another case pertaining to obstruction to work with criminal intent and injury by a man under Section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act will also be withdrawn. The UP government gave its sanction for withdrawal of the cases on January 10 and the note was sent on January 29. The government had sought an opinion on withdrawals of at least 119 riot FIRs filed at six police stations in 2013 including Fugana, Bhaurkala, Jansath and others. “Äfter evaluating the facts and available correspondence and documents, it has been decided after careful consideration, that the cases against accused must be withdrawn by presenting the approval before the district court,"" the recommendation note said. BJP MP Sanjiv Balyan had met CM Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow last year, urging him to withdraw cases lodged against Hindus. ""These men involved in alleged crime had been moving one Lok Adalat to another for the past six years. These cases were not of any big crime like murder, rape, or any grievous injury. SIT, set up by then government, had given clean chit to rich and affluent people and poor people were slapped with cases. If they are Hindus, it’s not my fault. I will fight for them always and I am thankful to UP CM Yogi Adityanath,"" Balyan told TOI. The MP said he has not asked for his own case to be withdrawn (he has been charged with rioting) or sought assistance for any other legislator or MP. ""I will be appearing for my own case on February 8. So what's wrong if I fight for these men and got their cases withdrawn?"" he asked. The recommendation note has also cited approval of UP governor Ram Naik in the cases. It has also cited CrPC Section 321, which allows withdrawal from prosecution, with consent of court at any time before the judgment is pronounced or withdraw from the prosecution of any person in any offence.

CBI informed Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Amit Arora that lie detector test of controversial businessman Abhishek Verma, who volunteered to support the case by deposing as a witness, was conducted last December but that report could not be finalised due to non-availability of scientists. The court asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to expedite the process of finalising the report and granted it two weeks time and listed the matter for hearing on March 8. Filing a regular status report, in a sealed cover, on further investigation in the case the CBI also informed the court that they had received some queries from the Canadian government to which they have replied and are not waiting for the response. The court had earlier asked the CBI to write to the Canadian high commission in New Delhi for information regarding the case as one of the key witnesses has been residing in Canada . Senior advocate H S Phoolka, who has been representing the riots victim, has claimed that witnesses were influenced and there was evidence of one of the key witnesses being sent to Canada, allegedly at the behest of Tytler and they would try to bring him back. He had told the court earlier that Tytler had sent Narinder Singh, son of witness Surinder Singh, to Canada and through him the Congress leader was putting pressure on his father to change the statement and depose in his favour. In June 2015, Verma had deposed before the CBI that Tytler had told him in 2008 he had met the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after which he got a clean chit by the CBI over his alleged role in the riots case. In his statement as a witness recorded by the CBI during a probe, Verma, an accused in the naval war room leak and other cases including cheating and forgery, had said Tytler had also told him that a deal was struck and a hefty amount was paid to a riots case witness, who had deposed against him. The CBI's move seeking permission to conduct polygraph test on Tytler and Verma had come in view of the court's December 4, 2015 order in which it was mentioned that the lie-detection test may be conducted, if required. Tytler had refused to undergo the polygraph test. The case pertained to the riots at Gurudwara Pulbangash in North Delhi where three people were killed on November 1, 1984, a day after the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. The victims had filed a protest petition challenging the CBI's closure reports in the case. The court had in December 2015 directed the CBI to further investigate the matter and said it would monitor the probe every two months to ensure that no aspect is left uninvestigated. The agency had reinvestigated the case of killing of Badal Singh, Thakur Singh and Gurcharan Singh near the Gurudwara after a court in December 2007 refused to accept its closure report. The CBI has filed three closure reports in the case. ",31 Jan 2019,2019-01-31 00:00:00

What happened to Haren Pandya? Victims of the 2002 riots have not got justice. He lacks humanity and compassion. I feel ashamed,” Banerjee said. “Just because he was questioned by CBI, everyone else has to be questioned too? His role in the riots was a known fact, hence he was questioned.” Saying that chit funds were created in the 1980s, the CM hit back: “Why was no action taken till 2011? They have destroyed the country in the last four years. We do not need their lectures.” Responding to the syndicate barb, Banerjee said: “He himself runs a syndicate of agencies. If it is about syndicate, he himself should be at the top of the top. People are tired of riot syndicate, lynch-ing syndicate, gau rakshak syndicate. He is the leader of syndicate of the agencies. The death knell of his government has been sounded. The expiry date of the Modi gove-rnment is here. He has ruled for five years with the help of CBI, IT and ED. They orchestrated riots and killed people.” “I respected Atalji. But many current leaders of BJP are not worthy of respect. BJP is destroying the country by promoting riots and violence. Democracy is under threat. Agencies are being misused. Political opponents are being targeted,” she said. The Bengal chief minister attacked the government for “destroying the economy with demonetisation and hurried implementation of GST”. “This is a fascist government. He has no courtesy. He does not know the way a PM must speak. His arrogance will soon end,” she said. “The opposition parties have one aim — ‘Modi hatao, desh bachao’. We organised the United India rally. Does he have any allies left? He is busy with his own fashion. He even reads his speeches from a teleprompter. He is good for nothing. He promised to bring back black money. We are in power. They are on their way out. They are bringing leade-rs from all over India to address rallies in Bengal. Had they given even a portion of this money to Bengal, people would have benefitted.” Taking a hard stance against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, Banerjee said: “They want us to pass the Citizenship bill. They are driving Bengalis out. Biharis and Nepalis are also being pe-rsecuted. Nearly 22 lakh Bengalis have been left out of NRC. We will not allow them to incite riots, we will not allow northeastern states to burn, we will not allow sectarian violence. They have to withdraw the bill.” She added: “Twelve thousand farmers have committed suicide during the Narendra Modi regime in India. Demonetisation is a big scam. Jan Dhan is a big scam. Rafale is a big scam. Bengal has withdrawn from Ayushmaan Bharat. Health is a state subject. So are education and agriculture. We have our Swasthya Sathi scheme. Healthcare is free in Bengal. They only speak about welfare of people during elections. They are copying our schemes, but faili-ng miserably while implementing them. For example, the budget of Beti Bachao per state is Rs 3-4 crore. The budget for Kanyashree scheme in Bengal is Rs 7,000 crore. The Centre promised that they will double farmers’ income by 2022. We have already tripled farmers’ income. We have waived khajna tax on agricultural land. We have started a new Krishak Bandhu scheme. What has he done for farmers and labourers?” “Bengal has been depriv-ed. No new trains have been allocated to the state. The new announcement on tax relief is also a hoax. The devil lies in the details. They know they will not remain in power. Hence, they are saying anything they want to. From the judiciary to the media, no one has been spared. What is the reason behind this arrogance? They are jealous of the progress of Bengal. Where were they when the state was suffering during Left rule? BJP and Left have become one. Don’t be surprised if participants at today’s rallies are seen at Brigade tomorrow.” ",03 Feb 2019,2019-02-03 00:00:00

In January 2008, a case under sections 148 (rioting with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawfull assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his dury), 353 (assault or criminial force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code , and under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, was registered at Narananda police station near here. In his statement, Jai Singh, resident of Petwar, alleged that a panchayat of all communities, except of his, was held in their village a day before the incident. On the fateful day, he claimed that a mob assembled outside their house and used casteist words against him and people of his community. The mob asked everyone from his community to leave their houses and threatened to burn their property down if they did not do so, he alleged. When women of the families protested, the mob entered the houses, broke their belongings, and set their homes on fire. During this time, some people informed the police. Though police teams, including officers, reached the spot, the crowd pelted stones at them and injured many cops and damaged their vehicles too. ",03 Feb 2019,2019-02-03 00:00:00

Kaur had told the court that she had seen Kumar allegedly addressing a crowd in Delhi’s Sultanpuri in 1984. “On November 1, 1984 when I stepped out to look for my goat, I saw Sajjan Kumar addressing the crowd saying ‘hamari ma maar di, Sardaro ko maar do’ (They killed our mother, kill the Sikhs),” Kaur told the court.

While 12 accused were acquitted in 2004, the five have remained absconding till date. In their absence, the court relied on the evidence from the previous trial and said there was discrepancy over the date on which the incident had occurred. Stating it was futile to keep the case pending, the court recalled the non-bailable warrants issued against the accused Harkisan Sarveya, Ashok Pardeshi, Dattaram More, Santosh Bendal and Raghunath Palkar. The case was registered by Dharavi police station in 1993. The prosecution told the court that in January 1993, communal riots were rife in the city. The prosecution said around 11.30pm on January 11, 1993, police noticed a mob of around 60 people near Kumbharwada kabrastan pelting stones and missiles towards a madrassa. The prosecution said the accused had the common object of destroying the madrassa and insulting religious sentiments. The prosecution further said police dispersed the mob by using lathi charge. During investigations, 22 accused were arrested and a chargesheet was filed. During the trial, the five accused, now discharged, absconded. The trial against them was separated and kept pending. One other accused died and the case against him was abated. On February 12, 2004, Sewri sessions court acquitted the other accused on trial. The court had then pointed out that most witnesses did not identify the accused. The court also held that except for the FIR and statement of one of the witnesses, there was absolutely no evidence to show that the incident took place on January 11, 1993, as claimed by the prosecution then.

""In this case a local leader of a political party was arrested for allegedly trying to instigate communal disturbance, though the Sabarimala issue has no minority connection.

Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa alleged that the Congress made Tytler sit in the front row at the event to ""intimidate"" witnesses in related cases. He claimed the Congress is ""afraid as it is aware that Tytler and Kamal Nath would also be jailed"" in cases related to the anti-Sikh riots. ""The Congress made Jagdish Tytler sit in the front row. It was a deliberate act to intimidate the witnesses in the anti-Sikh riots cases,"" he alleged. ""The Congress wants to send a message to the witnesses that the party high command supports Tytler and nobody should even try to testify against him,"" the MLA alleged. ""Since the conviction of Sajjan Kumar, the party is afraid... that the leaders whom it kept safe are now being jailed. By such acts, it is also sending a message to the judiciary and police that nobody should initiate action against them,"" Singh alleged. On the conviction of Sajjan Kumar, the Congress leader said that his name shouldn’t be clubbed with Kumar as there isn't an FIR in his name. ""What can a man say when the Court has given a verdict. You also mention my name. Why? Is there an FIR? Is there a case? No? Then why do you take my name? Someone said that and you believed it,"" he said. Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal too slammed the Congress party for inviting Tytler, saying that the party has no respect for the sentiments of Sikhs. ""What his family did earlier, Rahul ji is just continuing with that tradition. It clearly shows that they have no respect for sentiments of Sikhs,"" she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. On Wednesday, Rajiv Bhawan, the office of the state Congress, wore a festive look as Sheila Dikshit took charge as the party's Delhi chief in presence of a large gathering of workers and senior leaders. Three new working presidents — Devender Yadav , Haroon Yusuf and Rajesh Lilothia — also took charge along with Dikshit. The enthused workers greeted the former Delhi chief minister as she reached the office at DDU Marg with slogans and drum beats. Chants like ""Sheila Dikshit Ayi Hai, Badlaw Ki Andhi Layi Hai"" ""(Sheila Dikshit has come with a storm of change) were heard. With Dikshit at the helm of affairs, the party is looking to revive its fortunes in the national capital after a series of poll debacles starting with losing of power in 2013. Dikshit said she will take the party to new heights in Delhi where it will replace all and sought help of ground-level workers. She also said the Congress will make full efforts to win all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi. Dikshit, 80, was appointed to the post by the party's national president Rahul Gandhi after Ajay Maken stepped down citing health troubles. Senior Congress leaders Karan Singh , Janardan Dwivedi , Meira Kumar, PC Chacko, Sandip Dikshit and Ajay Maken were among those present as Dikshit took charge. ",16 Jan 2019,2019-01-16 00:00:00

A bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Ashok Bhushan and S K Kaul also issued notice on Kumar's bail plea. Kumar, 73, surrendered before a trial court here on December 31, 2018 to serve his sentence in accordance with the Delhi high court's December 17 judgement, which convicted and sent him to prison for the ""remainder of his natural life"". The case in which Kumar was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment 's Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984 and the burning down of a gurudwara. The riots broke out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984, by her two Sikh bodyguards. Kumar resigned from the Congress after his conviction in the case. The high court found Kumar guilty of criminal conspiracy and abetment in commission of crimes of murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony and defiling and destruction of a gurudwara. It also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by a trial court to five others -- former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and former MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar. In its judgment, the high court noted that over 2,700 Sikhs were killed in the national capital during the 1984 riots, which it described as a ""carnage of unbelievable proportions"". It said the riots were a ""crime against humanity"" perpetrated by those who enjoyed ""political patronage"" and aided by an ""indifferent"" law enforcement agency.

Refusing any relief, Justice V Parthiban dismissed the application moved by Reddy seeking to suspend the conviction and sentence till the final disposal of his appeal challenging the January 7 order of the special court. In view of the dismissal, Reddy has to surrender before the jurisdictional court, after which he would be lodged in a prison. When the appeal came up for hearing, Reddy contended that apart from the evidence provided by a prosecution witness, there is nothing else to prove the charges against him. A perusal of the witnesses and evidences would show that all the charges are attributed only against he first accused, Govinda Reddy, and not against the appellant. This apart, the public prosecutor also contended that the appellant alone could not be blamed for the violence as there were many onlookers when the incident happened. Moreover, mere participation in the protest could not make him guilty of the violence. Wondering why the prosecutor was supporting the accused while he was supposed to defend the prosecution, the judged asked whether the public prosecutor was of the opinion that the trial court had erred in its judgement. Answering in negative, the prosecutor said he was submitting only the facts stated in the FIR. On January 7, special court judge J Santhi found Reddy and 15 others guilty of offences under Sections 147 (rioting), 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC and Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Public Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act.

Of the nearly 22 Lok Sabha constituencies in the western region of the state, out of a total 80 in the state, SP is likely to contest around eight, giving BSP 11 and three to the RLD, though the final figures are yet to be declared . Sources said that SP may be making a retreat in the region to avoid any backlash on its candidates owing to the 2013 communal riots, which saw the death of over 50 people and thousands displaced. The riots took such serious proportion that then prime minister Manmohan Singh had visited the affected areas. Since then, top SP leadership has avoided visiting there. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had even stayed away from campaigning during the Kairana Lok Sabha byelections last year, when RLD fielded its candidate against the BJP. RLD, with the support of SP and BSP, had defeated the BJP candidate, which was the third consecutive defeat of the BJP following the BSP-SP alliance supported by RLD. Now, as Lok Sabha elections near, SP is likely to take the same line and field less candidates in the region and allow BSP to have a larger chunk. With the support of RLD, the alliance is banking upon the powerful combination of Jat-Jatav-Muslims to give a stiff challenge to the BJP. Like BSP, RLD had also drawn a blank in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections after the Jats’ exodus to BJP. However, RLD leadership has worked hard over the last year and is seen to have substantially regained ground by raising agrarian issues. Another reason for SP to maintain a low profile is the thin presence of its committed votebank of Yadavs, whose presence here in west UP is negligible. ",18 Jan 2019,2019-01-18 00:00:00

He said Modi had not only fast-tracked development and infrastructure in Punjab, but had also resolved long pending issues of the Sikh community. “Be it the investment of Rs 30,000 crore on creating a world class road network, to building new airports, sanctioning IIM at Amritsar and AIIMS at Bathinda, or releasing funds for the Shahpur Kandi dam, the NDA government has always kept Punjab first,” said Sukhbir, adding that previous Congress governments had always discriminated against Punjab and Punjabis. The former deputy CM alleged that the Congress government in the state Punjab backtracked from its pre-poll promises of agri loan waiver and betrayed the farmers. “Maize growers are suffering because the Punjab government has not come out with a compulsory procurement policy for this and other crops,” he said, while appealing for extending more support to farmers, farm labourers and small industry and trade. Praising Modi, Sukhbir said, “Steps taken by Modi government have already resulted in conviction of two persons in anti-Sikh riots case within one year. PM has had also fulfilled the ‘ardas’ of Nanak Naam Leva Sangat by deciding to establish a corridor from Indian territory in Gurdaspur district to Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan.

She said during their 20-minute long meeting with the PM, “we three” did most of the talking. “We demanded that there should be no further delay in the cases of massacre of Sikhs and all cases should be fast tracked so that other victims also get justice. Tytler and Kamal Nath should also be investigated thoroughly without any delay, and prosecuted,” she said. The three riot victims also raised the issue of security of their families. “Our security was scaled down over two years back. Now that Sajjan has gone to jail, the threat to our families and children has increased and we flagged this issue in our conversation with the PM,” she added. “He told us that he was proud of our courage for fighting for justice for 34 long years despite all the adversities,” Nirpreet said. It is learnt that Kaur told the PM that, “For 34 years, I had this feeling that India is not our country. But now I feel some justice is there for us too.” Others who accompanied the victims were SAD president Sukhbir Badal and Union minister Harsimrat Badal, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal.

He advised Harsimrat to refrain from questioning his loyalty and rise above her narrow interests instead. Reacting to Harsimrat saying that the Punjab government is not starting the process of land acquisition for Kartarpur corridor, Amarinder said as it was a Central project, his government could acquire land only once the Central government identified it. The Union government has failed to identify land so far, he said. “Your (Harsimrat’s) loyalty to the party has been questioned by your own party members, while that to Punjab has been rejected by none other than people of Punjab, whose lives you destroyed mercilessly in the 10 years of SAD-BJP misrule,” he said. Be it Kartarpur corridor or the Panth, he said the Badals have been playing with people’s religious sentiments for years together. According to the CM, such policies would continue to backfire on them, as it did in the assembly elections, subsequent by-elections and other elections in the state. On SAD president Sukhbir Badal’s statement alleging the involvement of the Gandhi family in the 1984 anti-Sikh violence, he said the Badals are using the riots to further their vested interests.

Sasikumar, spokesman of HM, was hacked to death at Subramaniyampalayam near Thudiyalur on September 22, 2016. Thousands of Hindu Munnani cadres conducted a rally the next day to take the body to Thudiyalur from the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). The petition said that HM functionaries used the funeral procession to create a riot-like situation. “They tried to get political gain by the riot. They damaged six vehicles of the police department, 34 buses, 39 shops belonging to Muslims, 15 shops belonging to Hindus and 10 private vehicles. They damaged properties worth about Rs 5crore. As many as 237 cases were registered against HM cadres at Race Course, Saibaba Colony, Kuniyamuthur, Thudiyalur and other police stations and 642 cadres were arrested,” the petition said. “The Madras high court had instructed the city police commissioner and superintendent of police to assess the damage caused to the properties and collect compensation. Last year, the Supreme Court had ordered that political parties that conduct protests and rallies are responsible for the damages caused and compensation should be collected from them. But the district administration and police have failed to implement the court orders. We request the district administration to form a committee to collect Rs 5crore from HM,” Ramakrishnan said. Meanwhile, Hindu Makkal Katchi founder president Arjun Sampath on Tuesday told reporters that compensation should be given to those, who were affected during the riot. “We agree to the demands of the forum,” he said.

The riot victim is from Bapunagar area. She wanted wanted to challenge the acquittal order before the HC on merits, but she was not granted permission to file an appeal. Another petitioner was a rape victim from Banaskantha district. Her stepfather was a complainant. a trial court acquitted the accused. The state government’s request to file appeal against acquittal was rejected. The victim felt that the prosecution was not proper and sought court’s permission to file an appeal against the acquittal. Since the HC had rejected state government’s request to file an appeal, it rejected the victim’s request too. Both the victims raise an important issue on what can a victim do when they are not aware of the outcome of criminal proceeding. This led a division bench to take a decision on provisions of law – Section 372 of the CrPC, particularly considering various judgments passed by the Supreme Court. The bench permitted both the victims of offences to file appeal directly without seeking HC’s permission. The HC ordered that “requisite sensitivity” should guide the cause of victims, for “victim has an absolute, independent, substantive right conferred upon it to prefer and appeal against the judgement and order of (i) acquittal (ii) conviction for lesser offence (iii) inadequate compensation.” The HC clarified that if the state government fails to convince the HC to permit it to file an appeal against lower court’s order, it “would not preclude the complainant of victim from preferring an appeal. Victims and the state government can independently file appeals without being dependent on the exercise of right by the other”. The HC cited the United Nation’s Declarations of basic principles of justice for victims of crimes and abusers of power, Malimath Committee and 154th Law Commission Report to say that such rights must be given their due primacy and recognition. “They also need not be merely on statute books without corresponding teeth to implement,” it said. The HC ordered for fine-tuning its docket system to implement this order. The trial courts have been ordered to mention all details of complainants/victims in their final orders. The trial court will also have to communicate the orders, even through electronic medium, to victims. In case of death or incapacity of victims, the courts will have to communicate their orders to victims’ relatives. The HC will have to issue notice to all complainants/victims of the crime when the state government or the accused file an appeal against the trial court order so that they can become party to the proceedings in the high court.

Kumar (73) reached the court at 2.18pm following the surrender of former MLAs Kishan Khokhar and Mahender Yadav, who were also convicted in the same case. The two MLAs will serve 10-year jail terms. All three surrendered before duty magistrate Aditi Garg, who directed that Kumar be lodged in Mandoli Jail in northeast Delhi. Turns here Kumar, a three-time MP, walked in and walked out of the courtroom amid tight security while some of the victim families remained outside the main gate of the court complex. After surrendering, he was accosted on the ground floor and put in a police van, along with a couple of police cars, which left for the jail. Though Kumar’s plea to be lodged in the high-security Tihar Jail was rejected, the court allowed his plea for security. Media persons were not allowed inside the courtroom when proceedings were on. A source, privy to the legal developments, said the court took into consideration the plea for security observing threat for his arraignment in another anti-Sikh riots case. Senior advocate H S Phoolka, who appeared for the victim families, told TOI, “This is a new year gift to the nation. We have shown that no one is above law in our country. This is a warning to the people who commit crimes when they are in power. The law will catch up with them one day and they will have to spend their final years in jail.” Earlier this month, Kumar sought time on Thursday till January 30 from Delhi high court to surrender. Claiming innocence, Kumar urged the court to grant him 30 more days to surrender so that he can settle certain property matters, meet his close relatives and friends, who have been associated with him for the past seven decades. In the application, Kumar said he has a big family, including a wife, three children and eight grandchildren and has to settle certain matters, including those related to property. HC had before the directed Kumar to surrender by December 31 after holding him guilty, but Kumar has urged the court to give him time till January 30 to surrender.

The jibe, apparently directed at Kamal Nath , the new Madhya Pradesh chief minister, came during a rally where he also charged the opposition party of “deceiving” farmers with loan waiver promises. Kamal Nath has in the past denied such allegations over the riots, saying he had nothing to do with them. The planned corridor between a gurdwara here and a Sikh shrine in Kartarpur, just a few kilometres across the border with Pakistan, also figured in the address. Modi said the entire country had waited for justice for the past 35 years and wanted Congress leaders to be punished for it. “Even today, this demand is there,” he said. He alleged that “files” on such culprits were kept under wraps on the suggestion of “one family”, an apparent reference to the Gandhis. In an indirect reference to the recent conviction of Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in one riot-related case, Modi added, “The NDA government pulled out such files, set up the SIT (special investigation team) and now the results are before you.” Modi also attacked the Congress for charging him with corruption in the Rafale deal with France for 36 military aircraft, saying the party was “spreading lies” to weaken the defence forces. He said the country needed to be wary of the Congress, claiming its history had been the glorification of “one family”. He said it was made up of people, “who even today oppose the raising of Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata ki Jai slogans, whose history is of the massacre of thousands of Sikhs in cold blood, and those who even today reward the riot accused with the chair of the chief minister”. Modi accused the national leaders at the time of Partition of failing to ensure that Kartarpur, where the founder of Sikhism spent his final years, did not go to Pakistan. For seven decades, devotees could get a glimpse of the historic gurdwara only through binoculars, he said. He said the NDA government took the “historic decision” to build the Kartarpur corridor , which will link Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur to Kartarpur Sahib. Without taking names, Modi took a dig at Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, who went against chief minister Amarinder Singh's advice and travelled to Pakistan for the groundbreaking ceremony of the planned corridor. He said the Congress leaders gave an “opportunity” to Pakistan through that trip. He hit out at the Congress for playing politics of “lies and deceit” on farm loan waivers. “The Congress fooled the people for decades with the slogan of ‘Garibi Hatao' (remove poverty) and now it is deceiving the country in the name of loan waivers,” he said. The Prime Minister claimed this happened in Punjab as well, saying the Congress government in the state had waived only a small portion of the loans. Modi made similar claims about the Congress promises before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and the recent assembly elections in Karnataka. Arrest warrants are being issued against farmers for not paying back loans in Karnataka, he claimed. He said while the Congress governments had delayed the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report, the BJP government at the Centre had implemented its recommendations on minimum support prices (MSP). “Those who failed to find a solution to the farmers' woes for decades and kept delaying the decision on MSP, are now again throwing dust in the eyes of farmers with their false promises,” he said. Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur attended the rally, held by the BJP and the SAD to thank the Prime Minister for the development of the region.

According to official figures, the number of rioting cases went from 137 cases in 2016 to 139 in 2017 and shot up to 181 till November 31, 2018, as cops are collating data for December 2018. However, the cops have another angle. “Communally, the city has been calm and quiet. But in the last year we have seen a lot of caste confrontations, attacks on migrants from UP and Bihar, protests against films and lots of incidents resulting from the Patidar agitation. These makes the figures look inflated,” said Ahmedabad police commissioner A K Singh. The number of cases registered under the head of dacoity has also shot up. The number was 12 in 2016 and 16 in 2017, but jumped to 43 from in the first 11 months of 2018. Of these 43 cases, 40 have already been detected. “Even some cases relating to attacks on migrants or the Patidar protests and film protests we have invoked the stringent dacoity section, and this may have bloated the figures,” Singh added. Singh said free and fair registration of cases is another factor behind the high numbers. “We registered each case of according to its legal definition and that is why the figures look inflated,” he added. Meanwhile, the crackdown on bootleggers and gambling den operators also reflect in the figures. From 1,027 cases of gambling in 2016, the number rose to 1,337 in 2017 and on to 1,610 for 11 months of 2018. Similarly, the number of prohibition cases also rose, going from 12,580 in 2016 to 14,954 in 2017 and on to 15,383 till November 2018. “This is the result of strict policing and the crackdown on the liquor mafia. We have and will continue the crackdown to stop the flow of liquor in Gujarat ,” said Singh, adding that the number of detentions under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act has also been unprecedented this year. While 924 persons were detained under PASA in 2016 and 935 in 2017, the number till November 2018 was 1,144. “These numbers could rise, as we have still have a number of PASA proposals pending,” said a senior police official.
