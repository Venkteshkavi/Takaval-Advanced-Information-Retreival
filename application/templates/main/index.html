                    <p class="text-description">
                        Riots & Violence happen all over the world and have a huge societal impact. 
                        There is an information need to capture these events in a single data source 
                        so that a user who wishes to analyse the extent of social unrest in a region donâ€™t 
                        have to go through the hassle of gathering data from myriad data sources. Takaval automates the process of ingesting data 
                        from multiple data sources and generating events from them. Takaval also attribute a 
                        cause to the events and specify the type of activity that led to it.
