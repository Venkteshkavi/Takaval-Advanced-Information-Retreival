How many can afford this fee for the course?,"" she said.JNU Vice-Chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar said, ""A discussion cannot happen when 500 people are standing and shouting at you. It happens in a peaceful atmosphere. Right from the beginning, they are against opening the management school in the campus.

How can a circular like this be passed to all departments, and remain unnoticed. The only thing I could do is resign from board.

Before assuming power, Modi ji promised fulfilling our demands and assured to double our income. Even today he is our Prime Minister and the BJP is the ruling party and that is why we are making this demand to them.""The leader wondered as to what stopped the party from giving an assurance.Already, he said, he has booked train tickets for 300 farmers to go to Varanasi.Farmers from districts, including Tiruvannamalai and Tiruchirappalli, will reach Varanasi, he said.The BJP-led government at the centre had promised to fulfill their demands including profitable prices for farm produce, loan waiver from all banks including nationalised, and cooperative and Rs 5,000 pension for farmers over 60, Ayyakannu said.""At the least, let the lone BJP MP from Tamil Nadu Pon Radhakrishnan commit that our promises will be honoured in the manifesto, we may think about reconsidering our decision,"" he said.In November 2018, farmers led by Ayyakannu had gone to Delhi with two ""skulls,"" to take part in a kisan rally, saying it belonged to their colleagues who had allegedly committed suicide over debt.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Why did I do it? To send a signal to Africa"".He reportedly told investigators that Italy's impounding Tuesday of migrant rescue ship ""Mare Jonio"" off the Italian island of Lampedusa with 48 people aboard had been a tipping point for him.Quoting three students on the bus, Messagero daily reported Sy had first attempted a hijack on Monday, two days earlier.""He tried to change the route but a teacher intervened and said 'what are you doing? Stick to the right route'.""That day, the trio said, Sy appeared very nervous, shouting insults at one child.The government, in the shape of deputy prime minister, Luigi di Maio, and far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, say Rome could now revoke Sy's passport.The debate has become increasingly heated in a country where Salvini's tough anti-immigration stance is popular with conservatives.In February last year, Italy was similarly rocked when far-right militant Luca Traini fired on a dozen African migrants in the central town of Macerata, injuring six. The attack was an apparent response to the killing of a young Italian woman, allegedly by a Nigerian drug dealer.Brenton Tarrant, accused of last week's Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, had scrawled Traini's name on one of his weapons.Anti-mafia state prosecutor Cafiero de Raho warned La Stampa daily the time had come to ""tone down"" the rhetoric, citing the danger of people further feeding on existing extremism and racial hatred.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

One of group managed to call the police, who rushed to the scene and broke the bus windows to get everyone to safety.Palmieri said some children were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure because they had bruises or were in a state of shock, but none suffered serious injuries.A teacher who was with the middle school children was quoted by Ansa news agency as saying that the driver had said he wanted to get to the runway at Milan's Linate airport.An unnamed girl was also quoted as saying that Sy blamed deputy prime ministers Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio for the deaths of African migrants at sea.The United Nations estimates that some 2,297 migrants drowned or went missing in the Mediterranean in 2018 as they tried to reach Europe.A Libyan security official said on Tuesday that at least 10 migrants died when their boat sank off the Libyan coast near the western town of Sabratha.The Italian government has closed its ports to charity rescue ships that pick up migrants off the Libyan coast.

another weekend of rioting in the capital during ""yellow vest"" protests which have put President Emmanuel Macron on the defensive.The police's failure to keep the Paris protests from spiralling out of control over the weekend again cast a harsh spotlight on their tactics.About 5,000 police were deployed in the capital on Saturday, far outnumbering the several hundred black-clad rioters who caused havoc in front of groups of often passive policemen for more than seven hours on the famed Champs-Elysees.Business owners were left fuming Monday, as Macron cut short his skiing holiday to meet top ministers to discuss the 18th consecutive Saturday of""yellow vest"" demonstrations.""The events of last Saturday, in particular on the Champs-Elysees, were unacceptable and the president asked the government to provide a response that was up to the needs of the situation,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a televised statement.After criticising ""inappropriate"" instructions on the use of rubber bullets given to security forces, he announced that the head of Paris police, 66-year-old Michel Delpuech, had been fired and would be replaced on Wednesday.He said French authorities would ban rallies on the Champs-Elysees and elsewhere if hooligans were detected there, adding that fines would be increased from 38 to 135 euros for people attending unauthorised protests.While the public's safety remains a priority, ""the outburst of violence justifies a firm (police) response,"" Philippe told France 2 television on Monday evening.Numbers downMore than 100 businesses were damaged at the weekend in Paris including dozens of luxury shops and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees.Since the end of December, the number of ""yellow vest"" protesters has fallen, but each Saturday thousands still take to the streets, including far-right and far-left groups as well as anarchists who are responsible for much of the violence.A hard core of protesters have already vowed to cause havoc again next Saturday.""Every Sunday large cities across France wake up to the same old story: smouldering barricades and a strident declaration from Christophe Castaner,"" leftwing daily Liberation wrote Monday.Some have called for French police to be far more active in tackling troublemakers.""You have to take responsibility and engage, with the possibility that people will get hurt,"" said Frederic Lagache of the Alliance police union on Monday.For decades, French authorities have usually preferred the opposite, controlling mass protests with tear gas and rubber bullets while avoiding physical confrontation between police and large groups, experts say.Although some protesters have been injured by the rubber bullets, so far nobody has been killed in clashes with police, but officials say the risk would increase if officers charged the hostile crowds.""They would rather see a building damaged, with insurance companies footing the bill, than risk direct contact between police and demonstrators that might cause serious injuries or death,"" said Olivier Cahn at France's Cesdip law enforcement research institute.'Less reactive'But critics say the government needs to drastically rethink its approach for stamping out the rioting.""There are techniques and strategies for separating violent demonstrators from the others,"" Cahn said.""Germany has strategies for de-escalating the tensions and separating protesters that are quite effective.""Junior Interior Minister Laurent Nunez admitted on RTL radio on Monday that police ""were less aggressive, less reactive than usual"" over the weekend, promising a review of the instructions given to officers and their deployment.Castaner, a long-time ally of Macron who had no law-and-order experience before becoming interior minister in October, is also facing renewed scrutiny of his record amid calls for his resignation from some in the opposition Republicans party.While seen as too lax on Saturday, French authorities have been accused on other weekends of being too heavy-handed, highlighting the government's difficulty of managing the crisis.The UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet called for a ""full investigation"" into the possible use of excessive force by French police during the protests in an address on March 6.Since the demonstrations began on November 17, some 1,900 people have been hurt, including dozens who have suffered serious injuries from stun grenades or rubber bullets fired by police.Rights groups have tried to have the heavy rubber bullets used by the French police banned, noting that France is one of only a handful of Western countries to use them.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

He died during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, the police added.The incident triggered massive protests and clashes in Awantipore as hundreds of students took to streets demanding action against those responsible for his death.The family of the victim said Rizwan Asad had no links with any terror group and they were being harassed just because they are supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami, an organisation banned by the government last month.Reacting to the incident, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah has demanded an exemplary punishment for the ""killers"" of the man.""I had hoped custodial deaths were a thing of our dark past. This is an unacceptable development and must be investigated in a transparent, time bound manner. Exemplary punishment must be handed out to the killers of this young man,"" he tweeted.Midnight raids, crackdowns, rampant arrests, custodial murders, denial of democratic right to choose a government.

Former IAS Officer Shah Faesal Launches New Party In Kashmir,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/shah-faesal-jammu-and-kashmir-peoples-movement-launched-by-former-ias-officer-2008903,Shah Faesal had also launched a crowdfunding campaign in January to support his initiative.,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-03/3rbbnsao_shah-faesal_625x300_17_March_19.jpg,"Former Kashmir bureaucrat Shah Faesal launched his political outfit -- the Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (JKPM) -- at an event in Srinagar on Sunday, two months afterhe quit government servicein protest against ""unabated killings in Kashmir"".The party launch event took place at Gindun Park in Rajbagh area, which was festooned with banners and white flags carrying Mr Faesal's picture. In his address to the gathering, mostly comprising youth, the civil services topper-turned-politician admitted that he had initially arrived at an incorrect diagnosis of the Kashmir situation. ""When I joined the civil services 10 years ago, I believed that we can change the lives of people by providing roads, electricity and safe drinking water. But I have understood that as long as the youth in Kashmir live in a state of constant fear, and as long as our mothers and sisters face the prospect of losing their dignity and dear ones, nothing will work here,"" news agency IANS quoted him as saying.Mr Faesal, a self-confessed admirer of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it is natural for people to ""discredit a new ideaor understate a revolution"" that's still in the making. ""Some say we are agents of the army. I'm ready to face all criticism, but our pursuit to usher in a new tomorrow will continue undeterred,"" he said.The objectives of JKPM were ""to work towards establishing an inclusive and pluralistic society with adequate political representation for under-privileged communities; promoting sustainable development strategies; building a progressive, gender-sensitive political institution with traditional values and modern sensibilities; uplifting marginalised communities; and establishing transparent, corruption-free politics in Jammu and Kashmir"", IANS quoted him as saying.In a Facebook post put up on the day of his resignation in January, Mr Faesal claimed that ""Muslims had been reduced to second-class citizens"" in the country. He also hit out against the centre, accusing it of subverting public institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the National Investigation Agency to fulfill its political needs.Since then, the former bureaucrat has been building up a support base among the Jammu and Kashmir youth andgathering public supportfor his initiative towards ensuring ""corruption-free, clean and transparent"" politics in the state. Although National Conference chief Omar Abdullahhad sent feelers to him back then, Mr Faesal clarified that he does not intend to join any of the mainstream political parties in the state.(With inputs from IANS)Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

I got to know through the media that he is a little upset. I will call to ask if this is so, and if he is actually upset, I will try and resolve the issue,"" he said at a press conference here.However, Mr Paswan claimed that it was too late in the day to make any changes in the seat-sharing agreement. ""I do not wish to cause Giriraj-ji any grief, but I think we have gone too far now to revisit the decision,"" he said.The BJP had given Bihar's Nawada to the LJP on Sunday, offering the Begusarai seat to Mr Singh instead. The Union Minister, however, seemed far from happy. ""Why should I contest from Begusarai and not Araria?"" news agency IANS quoted him as saying earlier today.Many saw this as an indication that Mr Singh may not contest from Begusarai. According to IANS, the Union Minister had even announced last week that he wouldn't mind sitting out the elections if Nawada was not allotted to him.The state BJP, however, downplayed his protests. ""Giriraj Singh will abide by the party's decision... The LJP is likely to field Veena Devi, the sitting Munger parliamentarian, from Nawada,"" IANS quoted a party leader as saying on the condition of anonymity.The LJP will announce candidates for the six seats it will contest from Bihar by Wednesday. ""We are saddened by the demise of former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. It is a big loss to politics. As the nation is mourning his death, we are not going to announce the names of our candidates today,"" the news agency quoted him as saying at the press conference.According to news agency PTI, he also said that while the ruling alliance has already divided seats among its partners amicably, the grand alliance of opposition parties is nowhere near doing so. ""The so-called grand alliance has turned out to be an illusion,"" he said, asserting that the NDA will win over 350 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha in the upcoming elections.Under the National Democratic Alliance'sseat-sharing arrangement in Bihar, the BJP and the Janata Dal-United will contest 17 seats each while the LJP fields candidates from six.

The project will cover almost 90km and is estimated to cost almost Rs 27,000 crore. But a petition against it has gathered more than one lakh signatures - as many citizens say it would not be worth the loss of thousands of trees, the expense and the disruption. They suggest more focus on public transport like buses and the suburban railway.Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Twitter requested the protesting citizens to meet him and ""raise their concerns"" against the project.One of the biggest hurdles in Bengaluru's progress is traffic congestion.The#elevatedcorridorproject is the solution to this.Some citizengroups r protesting agnst the project. My request to all is to come to me&raise their concerns.I will listen with an open mind to ur feedbackAt the protest in the city, Prakash Belawadi, actor and director said, ""For now we are saying Tender Raddu Madi"" which means cancel the tender.""We still don't know how to protest against the project because we have not seen the detailed project report. We don't know the logic for it. We don't know what studies they have done. We are saying we still don't know what the project is. You can't call a tender to build a house when you still don't have a proper plan. We found out that the tender has been ready for two years. What kind of arrogance is that?"" he said.Architect Naresh Narasimhan was unhappy about the lack of transparency. He said, ""They (politicians) are all custodians of public money. There is an Act called the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act. Any major project inside the city has to go through four stages of consultation. They have gone in a pole-vault from - somebody gave an idea to a tender. Even the DPR and feasibility report has not been released in public. It has not been approved by the cabinet.""Actor Arundhati Nag was also at the protest and she said, ""It is haphazard. We have to think ahead. We have to plan it. We can't just connect one side of the city to the other. Improve public transport - then people will stop using their private vehicles. Tax vehicles more.""The state government has been trying different methods to improve travel through the city - but mega-projects have often become controversial. A plan for a steel flyover on the route to the airport that would have involved cutting many trees was vigorously opposed and later scrapped. It is estimated that the Elevated Corridor project would involve the loss of at least 3000 trees.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Under Mr Ramnath, the smelter was ordered shut at least twice, including for an alleged gas leak in 2013.Local residents and environmental activists have staged protests against the plant over allegations of pollution as well as the earlier gas leak. Vedanta says the claims of pollution are false, without any factual basis. It also denied being the source of the gas leak.The chief executive replacement comes amid a drawn-out legal battle over the smelter that could be complicated further by the national elections that start on April 11. The two main political parties in Tamil Nadu are against reopening the smelter, increasing the likelihood that the shutdown will continue.Vedanta won a judgment in December from the National Green Tribunal that would have cleared the way to reopen the smelter, but the Supreme Court ruled in February that the environmental court did not have jurisdiction over the smelter.""My tenure as the CEO has been an eventful journey, and as is the case with any journey, there have been numerous ups and downs,"" Mr Ramnath, who will continue as an advisor to the company, said in a statement.Mr Kumar, who will also oversee operations at Vedanta's Malco Energy Limited and Fujairah Gold, has worked at Hindustan Zinc, Tata Steel and Adani Ports, in a career stretching over 29 years.Mr Kumar was also chief operating officer at Sterlite Copper in the past, the company said.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

We are hopeful that our all the demands will be accepted by the government,"" he said.SLAD president Manoj Patwari said they were told that Mr Fadnavis would hold a meeting with them on Thursday. ""If all the demands are not met during that meeting, we will not back off...we will boycott voting in the coming elections,"" he said.""We need to see whether the assurance given by the government is going to be implemented or not,"" Mr Patwari added.Mr Kamble said, ""Majority of their demands, such as getting a driving licence, appointment of sign language interpreters in various departments, setting up special education institutes from Class I to Class XII in Nashik and Latur and preferences to specially-abled people, including the deaf, in jobs, have been accepted.""Mr Kamble also said that an inquiry committee has been formed to probe the lathi-charge incident.""After receiving the inquiry report, a decision will be taken...There is a fear among the youth that cases will be registered against them, but I would like to assure that no such cases will be registered against them,"" he said.The agitators had alleged that police baton-charged them despite their peaceful protest, while the police claimed they used only mild force as protesters blocked roads and disrupted traffic for immediate resolution of their demands.Earlier today, the Maharashtra government expressed regret in the state Legislative Council over the police baton-charge on the hearing impaired students.Replying to a demand by Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council Dhananjay Munde to suspend the errant policemen, Revenue Minister Chandarakant Patil said an inquiry had been instituted into the incident.The Shiv Sena, a constituent of the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, demanded a judicial probe.Chandarakant Patil, who is the leader of the Upper House, said, ""The demands of the students are being discussed. We are positive about fulfilling them. Arrangements are being made to bring the students here. Action would be taken against those responsible (for the lathi-charge).""NCP leader Dhananjay Munde said if demands of the students were fulfilled at the district level itself, the protest need not have happened.He alleged that the government was busy issuing advertisements, while the youth were demanding jobs.Shiv Sena MLC Neelam Gorhe demanded a judicial probe into the incident, claiming that the police would suspend some of its personnel who would then approach the MAT (Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal) and resume office.This way, she alleged, the real culprits would go unpunished and the innocent would be targeted.She also demanded that the transfer of Balaji Manjule, State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, be cancelled.NCP legislator Vidya Chavan attacked the government saying that while it used terms like ""divyang"" for people with disabilities, the police was attacking them.""The chief minister, who also holds the Home portfolio, should come to the House and apologise,"" she said, adding that police should not be made scapegoats in the issue.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

We had doubts whether his speech was going to be in the interest of the state or the RSS. Hence, we decided to boycott it,"" he added.NCP's group leader in the Assembly Jayant Patil told reporters outside the House that the opposition had taken the decision to protest Mr Rao's support to the RSS, ""which sows the seeds of divisiveness"".""A governor's post is constitutional and his remarks were unwarranted. The governor supports the RSS. The promises made by the governor have remained unfulfilled, so we have decided to boycott his speech,"" Mr Patil said.Before the governor could begin his speech, opposition parties staged a protest against Mr Rao's remarks at the steps of the Vidhan Bhavan.Some opposition members also raised slogans against the BJP-led state government.On Sunday, opposition parties boycotted the customary tea party hosted by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on the eve of the interim budget session.They said the state government should not announce any ""populist"" or policy decisions during the six-day session.The vote-on-account, which will have budget provisions till July 31, will be tabled on February 27.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

"""For Life And Lung"": Gurugram Residents March To Save Aravalli Forests",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/for-life-and-lung-gurugram-residents-march-to-save-aravalli-greens-1998569,People of all ages gathered at Khushbu Chowk with placards and banners before taking out a two-kilometre march against the planned legislative move.,,"Nearly a hundred residents of Gurugram took out a protest march on Sunday to push for safeguarding the Aravalli range, a vital ecological zone and biodiversity hotspot that's home to nearly 400 species of plants and 200 species of native and migratory birds. As many as 60,000 acres of theprotected forested areais likely to become available for construction purposes soon, with the Haryana government all set to table an amendment to this effect in the ongoing assembly session.People of all ages, from teenagers to senior citizens, gathered at Khushbu Chowk with placards and banners before taking out a two-kilometre march against the planned legislative move. ""If they want real estate development, there are lots of other places for it. You have to know which areas to protect and which places to build structures. We are not saying no to development, but it should not come at the cost of destroying the Aravallis. It will lead to the destruction of both air and water quality in the area,"" Vineeta Singh, one of the protesters, said.A study of the Aravalli hills in southern Haryana by the Wildlife Institute of India a few years ago identified it asIndia's most ""degraded"" forest range. The study, conducted between January and April 2016, found that ""most of its indigenous plant species have disappeared... and the most serious threat to wildlife and forests is development activities, which are gradually destroying its remnants"".The protesters said that development should not come at the cost of the country's precious resources.However, the Haryana government is now likely to bring an amendment to the Punjab Land Preservation Act-1900, which protects large portions of the Aravalli foothills. Once passed, it will be possible for realtors to take up construction activities on 60,000 acres of the forest land - affecting large areas of Gurugram and Faridabad. The forest cover in Haryana comes up to just 3.59%, the lowest in the country.Participants of the march also highlighted the effect such an action would have on people's health. ""Pollution levels are already high, even with the Aravallis intact. Things will get much worse if it is destroyed. People tell me not to live in Gurugram, but that can't be the solution. What we need is a sustainable development approach,"" said Sameexa Sud, a Class 12 student.Fitness enthusiasts in Gurugram stand to lose anirreplaceable venuefor trail runs and bicycling events if the Manohar Lal Khattar government goes ahead with the amendment. ""I come here twice a week with my friends to cover a distance of 30-40 km on bicycle. This attempt to allot 60,000 acres for construction purposes poses a big threat to the very concept of healthy living. There will be no space to jog and cycle, and pollutants in the air will only multiply,"" said Ali Masudi, another resident, adding that 90% of the people cannot afford PM2.5 masks.The protesters claimed that they met Haryana Forest Minister Rao Narbir Singh, who assured them that their objections will be taken into account.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

"Clashes Break Out On Venezuela Border, Police Fire Tear Gas",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/clashes-break-out-on-venezuela-border-police-fire-tear-gas-1998296,A social media video showed the troops driving armored vehicles across a bridge linking the two countries.,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-02/gobb8gso_gas650_625x300_23_February_19.jpg,"Venezuelan troops fired tear gas at angry protesters unable to cross into Colombia on Saturday after President Nicolas Maduro closed the border to stop the opposition bringing U.S. humanitarian aid into the South American nation.Demonstrators set up barricades and burned tires in the Venezuelan border town of Urena, as attention turned to whether National Guard troops stationed at the border crossing would fulfill Maduro's orders to block humanitarian aid from reaching a sick and hungry population.Four National Guard troops at the frontier disavowed Maduro's socialist government on Saturday, following an appeal from Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to let aid through.A social media video showed the troops driving armored vehicles across a bridge linking the two countries, knocking over metal barricades in the process, and then jumping out of the vehicles and running to the Colombian side.""Among the troops, whether they are in the army, air force, navy or National Guard, many people disagree (with what is happening),"" one of the troops, an officer whose uniform carried the name Linarez, told reporters after entering Colombia, according to another video on social media. ""You can't say anything against the government. It's treason.""Colombia's migration authority confirmed the defection of the four Venezuelan soldiers.Leaders of Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party call the aid effort a veiled invasion backed by Washington, and insist that the United States should instead help Venezuela by lifting crippling financial and oil sector sanctions.Venezuela's opposition says that while the need for basic food and medicines is desperate, the aid operation is also meant to embarrass military officers who continue to support Maduro's increasingly isolated government.Demonstrators in Urena who blocked roads and burned tires also threw rocks at security forces who responded with volleys of tear gas.The troops had earlier blocked people from crossing the border into Cucuta, where many Venezuelans now work, shop or send their children to school amid Venezuela's continued economic collapse.""We were all going to work. We want to work: the people attempted to force their way through,"" said Viviana Meza, 29, who works in a Cucuta restaurant.Guaido, recognized by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate head of state, defied court orders not to leave the country when he traveled on Friday to Cucuta, where aid from the U.S. and Colombian governments is stockpiled in warehouses.Guaido was due to hold a news conference with the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay in Cucuta on Saturday morning before escorting the aid toward the border on foot.A line of heavy trucks packed with aid supplies waited to attempt the crossing, in front of rows of television cameras.CONCERNS ABOUT VIOLENCEU.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton canceled plans to travel to South Korea to prepare for a summit addressing North Korea's nuclear program in order to focus instead on events unfolding in Venezuela, his spokesman said on Friday.""To Maduro's military cronies attacking civilians at the Brazilian border - the world is watching and the perpetrators will face justice,"" Bolton wrote on Twitter. ""The Venezuelan military should protect civilians, not shoot them.Guaido, 35, head of the opposition-run Congress, has provided few details on the transport plan. Trucks are expected to be driven by Venezuelan volunteers and some opposition figures have suggested forming human chains.Maduro blames the country's dire situation on U.S. sanctions that have blocked the country from obtaining financing and have hobbled the OPEC nation's oil industry.Concerns about the potential for violence flared on Friday when the Venezuelan army opened fire in an village near the Brazilian border after indigenous leaders attempted to prevent them from advancing, killing a woman and her husband.The U.S. government condemned the killings.The U.S. envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, who traveled to Cucuta on Friday, called them ""a crime and a disgrace"", while the U.S. State Department said ""egregious violation of human rights by Maduro and those who are following his orders will not go unpunished.""Venezuelan troops on Saturday morning had blocked the Brazilian border despite protests by villagers in the nearby town of Santa Elena de Uairen who burned a bus, a truck and a National Guard office overnight.""The situation is critical and we should be all united to allow the aid to pass,"" said shopkeeper Jeremy Ortega, 21.Brazil sent two small trucks with food and medicine to the border on Saturday, after the border closure foiled its plan to have more Venezuelans drive vehicles to pick up the 200 tonnes of aid it has stockpiled in the northern city of Boa Vista.Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo urged Venezuela's military to let the trucks in.Nearly 200,000 people attended a benefit concert in Cucuta on Friday featuring Latin pop stars, including Luis Fonsi of ""Despacito"" fame, many of whom called on Maduro to step down.A rival concert held by the ruling Socialist Party on the Venezuelan side was sparsely attended.Guaido in January invoked articles of the constitution to assume interim presidency and denounced Maduro as a usurper, arguing his 2018 re-election was illegitimate.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

The resignations threaten a decades-old two-party system.""The final straw for us has been this government's disastrous handling of Brexit,"" the three lawmakers, Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston, said in a statement.""We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP,"" they said, referring to a group of Conservative pro-Brexit lawmakers and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which props up the government in parliament.Earlier this week, seven former Labour lawmakers announced a new movement, the Independent Group, after quitting their party over increasing frustration with their leader Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit strategy and a row over anti-Semitism.Another former Labour lawmaker joined their ranks late on Tuesday, and several politicians from both the main opposition party and Conservatives said they expected more to follow from both sides of parliament.For May's Brexit plan, the resignations are yet another blow to more than two years of talks to leave the EU, which have been punctuated by defeats in parliament, rows over policy and a confidence vote, which she ultimately won.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

But I have received immense support and the film fraternity has shown great solidarity,"" said the director of the 2012 block busterBhooter Bhobishyot.The sit-in was organised by fans and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) activists outside Star Theatre, one of the oldest commercial Bengali theatre.Mr Dutta read out the letter sent by the veteran actor during the protest. Expressing shock, Mr Chatterjee said it was a 'vindictive act' of the administration. He referred to the comment made by the director during the 24th Kolkata International Film Festival last November.Mr Dutta had then criticised the 'excessive' use of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's posters in and around the film fest venues and argued that the film personalities should get more limelight during such events.Mr Chatterjee wondered if there will be 'any platform in the country where people can express themselves freely' and whether film makers will be able to include any content with which the authorities do not agree.""I strongly condemn such fascist policy even if they stay undercover,"" he wrote.In his letter, Mr Chatterjee hoped that all those responsible for taking off the film from the cinemas 'will realise that it is an undemocratic act' and 'protest against it'.A release from the film's production company said prior to its release, the State Intelligence Unit wrote to the producer Kalyanmoy Chatterjee seeking a private screening 'on a priority basis'.They asked for the screening in the light of information received that it may 'hurt public sentiments which may lead to political law and order issues'. The producer had immediately replied that the film has been passed by the CBFC and asking for private screening was beyond the jurisdiction and legal competence of the police.The team of ""Bhobishyoter Bhoot"" got no further response till the film released.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Stare-run oil companies andSaudi Aramco have teamed up to build the $44 billion refinery, which is aimed at giving India steady fuel supplies while meeting Saudi Arabia's need to secure regular buyers for its oil.But thousands of farmers are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood.After their protests, land acquisition has been stopped for the refineryat the proposed site at Nanar, a village in Ratnagiri district, some 400 km south of Mumbai, Mr Fadnavis said on Monday.The refinery will be built at a place where local population won't oppose the project, he said in a press conference, without identifying a new location.Mr Fadnavis made the announcement after the BJP forged an alliance with Shiv Sena for the upcoming general election.The location of refinery was one of the contentious issues between the parties, with Shiv Sena opposing the refinery.The announcement comes as Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to arrive in India on Tuesday and is expected to announce investments in energy and infrastructure during the visit.The Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), which is running the project, says the 1.2 million barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing.RRPCL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, has said suggestions the refinery would damage the environment were baseless.""The company is hopeful that the state government will provide sufficient land for the project on the western coast,"" Anil Nagwekar, a spokesman for the RRPCL, told Reuters.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

The meeting, Mr Kejriwal underscored, was not a political one, it was rather to discuss the ""fight for complete statehood"" that Delhi and Puducherry must have.""It is extremely important to express solidarity Narayansamy. Kiran Bedi is not allowing an elected government to run. She is trampling on the Constitution and democracy,"" Mr Kejriwal told NDTV.Mr Narayansamy was on a sit-down protest outside the Raj Bhavan for the last six days, waiting for Kiran Bedi's approval for his government's proposals on welfare schemes and administrative matters.

The HCM, Council Of Ministers, CS and Secretaries,met.It helped clarify and consolidate issues. Am happy Puducherry Government will return to work tom morning. So will the road to RajNivas be open for visitors to come to RajNivas.Mr Narayansamy thanked Mr Kejriwal and DMK's MK Stalin for showing solidarity.""This is not democracy. Chief Ministers sitting on dharna has become the norm. Lieutenant Governors in Puducherry and Delhi have been appointed with a mandate to not let these governments run,"" said Mr Kejriwal, who was on a nine-day dharna last year at the waiting room at Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal in Delhi.Recently, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also held a three-day sit-in protest against the Central government in Kolkata.Mr Kejriwal said full statehood should be granted to Puducherry and Delhi, union territories where the powers of the elected Chief Ministers are curtailed by Lieutenant Governors appointed by the central government. Mr Kejriwal contends that through them, the centre tends to rule by proxy.Contending the system can defy the will of the people, he said, ""Narayansamy is accountable to the people, Kiran Bedi is accountable to none... Kiran Bedi, who was defeated by the people, is ruling the people and Narayansamy, who was elected, sits on dharna"".The reference was to the BJP's defeat in Delhi, when they fielded the former top cop as the party's candidate for Chief Minister's post.

The last warning letter she received from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation, which comes under the Catholic Church, was on February 2.""Of course I am being targeted because I supported the nuns protesting against Bishop Franco Mullackal, after their colleague - a nun - raised allegations of sexual abuse against him. I have been a nun with them for 33 years, and all their complaints are based for just one year,"" Sister Lucy told NDTV with a confident smile.""I am not judging them (church authorities) still.

Only when they started protesting in Kochi, I got to know about them from the media. I haven't heard or seen Bishop Franco before that.

It was the time when five nuns from Kottayam had taken to the streets in their official robes, protesting against rape-accused Franco Mullackal.""My mind says that it is impossible for them to get me out of the convent.

Most Favoured Nation status is given to a trade partner to ensure non-discriminatory trade between two nations.On Thursday afternoon, a suicide bomber detonated a car-load of explosives next to a large convoy of 78 CRPF buses with over 2,500 personnel travelling on the highway from Jammu to Srinagar. At Pulwama, the car with 60 kg of explosives blew up, killing over 40 personnel reporting to duty after leave. The attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed immediately.India had last evening appealed to all members of the international community to ""support the proposal to list terrorists, including JeM chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council and to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan"", a clear reference to China which has been blocking all efforts to listing Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN Security Council.Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the attack a matter of ""grave concern"". But in a brief statement, it added, ""We strongly reject any insinuation by elements in the Indian government and media circles that seek to link the attack to the State of Pakistan without investigations.""With inputs from PTIGet the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

"""We Win"": Northeast Rejoices As Citizenship Amendment Bill Goes Off Rails",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/northeast-rejoices-as-citizenship-amendment-bill-goes-off-rails-1993239,"The Citizenship Amendment Bill will lapse on June 3, when the term of the present Lok Sabha ends.",,"Celebrations broke out across the Northeast today as the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill-2016 lapsed before it could be ratified by the Rajya Sabha. The legislation had set off protests in the region, spurring violence and pitting communities against each other.But it's over, at least for now. Like a bad dream.The Citizenship Amendment Bill will lapse on June 3, when the term of the present Lok Sabha ends. The 17th Lok Sabha has to be constituted before that date, in the wake of the upcoming parliamentary poll in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying hard to score a re-election.While bills that remain pending in the Rajya Sabha after being introduced there are not affected by the dissolution of the lower house, those that get stuck in the upper house while coming through the Lok Sabha route do lapse. The opposition had been opposing the provisions of the two bills in the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP-led government lacks numbers.The Citizenship Amendment Bill-2019 was intended at providing Indian citizenship to all immigrants - except Muslims - from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after a mere seven years of residence even if they do not have any documents. The legislation, passed by the Lok Sabha during the winter session on January 8, had been awaiting the Rajya Sabha's approval.The development has given rise to celebrations across the Northeast, especially in the opposition camp. ""This is the victory of secular India versus communal India. We have defeated this bill, which the BJP was trying to push despite it being against the constitution,"" said Assam Leader of Opposition Debabrata Saikia.The protesters are singing a similarly joyous tune. ""It is the victory of the indigenous people of the Northeast, who came together in protest,"" said Y Dilip Kumar, who was leading protests in Manipur.But the people remain wary of the BJP, a sentiment that gives the Congress a chance to reinvent itself in the region. The ruling party, for its part, hopes to make the most of the short breather it has received from the anti-citizenship bill protests.The National People's Party, the BJP's key partner in the Northeast, feels a crisis has been averted. Party leaders said they would have had no option but to walk out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance if the bill was passed. ""Everybody from political parties to civil society groups stood together to oppose the bill. Today, the sentiments and the voice of the northeastern people have prevailed,"" said Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma, who led the regional parties' joint platform against the bill.""Here, the message for politicians is that they should not forget that they are for the people, of the people and by the people,"" said Zubeen Garg, noted Assamese singer.(With inputs from PTI)Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Today's assurance, however, seems to have finally convinced them. According to reports reaching here, agitators have already vacated the Sawai Madhopur railway track - allowing train services between Delhi and Mumbai to resume.Protesters led byGujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainslahad also blocked the Jaipur-Bharatpur national highway, which is crucial for tourists travelling the golden triangle of Delhi, Agra and the Rajasthan capital. Now that the strike has been called off, bus services on the Jaipur-Kota, Jaipur-Agra and Jaipur-Bharatpur routes are expected to be restored by evening.The state government hadunanimously passed the Rajasthan Backward Classes (Amendment) Bill-2019on Wednesday. The legislation provided Gujjars with 5% reservation in a special category because the government held that circumstances have changed ever since the centre gave 10% reservation to economically weaker sections recently and brought about a constitutional amendment for the same.The bill sought to increase the backward classes' reservation from 21% to 26% with 5% quota for the Gujjar, Banjara, Gadia Lohar, Raika and Gadaria communities. It said that the need for such a provision was justified because these five communities were the ""most backward"" in the state.Soon after the agitation was called off, the Railways issued a notification stating that seven cancelled train services between Rajasthan and southern cities will resume with immediate effect. The Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani, which has been facing delays of nearly 10 hours due to diversions, will also start running on its usual route shortly.(With inputs from Agencies)Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

The curfew was imposed as authorities feared a communal backlash, they added.Protesters, particularly in the old city, refused to disperse even after loudspeakers announced that curfew was imposed.""We have imposed curfew in Jammu city as a precautionary measure,"" Deputy Commissioner of Jammu Ramesh Kumar told news agency PTI.There was a complete shutdown in Jammu city, with no traffic on roads and all shops and markets closed.Several areas of Jammu were hit by massive anti-Pakistan protests with people taking to the streets, including Jewel Chowk, Purani Mundi, Rehari, Shaktinagar, Pacca Danga, Janipur, Gandhinagar and Bakshinagar.According to some reports, there were mob attacks in Gujjar Nagar area where several vehicles were damaged by stone-throwers. However, the police said they had managed to prevent a major clash.Kashmiri employees at Jammu's Tourist Reception Centre have sent SOS messages to police seeking protection after mobs burnt vehicles outside TRC and pelted stones.Raising slogans against Pakistan and terrorists, protesters burnt tyres on roads. Demonstrators put up barricades demanding that the attacks be avenged.Jammu and Kashmir leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah condemned the violence.Distressed to hear about miscreants in Jammu trying to take advantage of the situation by inciting tension. Guv adm should have preempted this by securing minority dominated areas. Have spoken to IG Jammu to deploy additional security.It will be a travesty & against the spirit of our secular ethno-cultural values to use this terror attack as an excuse to target minorities. Hour of the need is to show compassion & come together.Giving vent to anger by attacking innocent people because of their ethnicity or religion is no way to honour the sacrifices yesterday. Reports of violence & arson in#Jammuare deeply worrying. I hope political leaders & civil society are able to ensure cooler heads prevail.Kashmiris/Muslims in Jammu didn't attack our CRPF jawans yesterday, terrorists did.

Thousands marched through its streets in sub-zero temperatures to seek a review of the centre's decision to grant Ladakh a separate administrative divison with its headquarters at Leh.Protests have been raging across Kargil for the sixth consecutive day, and all government offices have been closed to condemn the government's decision.As district offices in Kargil and Leh function under autonomous councils, the mass movement called by LAHDC Kargil has created a serious challenge for the governor's administration. ""Establishing the headquarters of Ladakh division at Leh has hurt the sentiments of the people of Kargil,"" the civic body's resolution read.A controversial order passed by the government on February 8 sanctioned the creation of a separate administrative and revenue division comprising Leh and Kargil districts, with its headquarters at Leh. Ladakh was part of Kashmir division until now. Residents, however, have refused to be part of the newly created division unless there is six-month rotation of offices between Leh and Kargil.Terming the government order as ""absolute injustice"", LAHDC Chief Executive Councillor Feroz Ahmad Khan said the government was free to establish the headquarters at Leh as long as Kargil remains with Kashmir division. All the elected leaders from Kargil, including Mr Khan, have threatened to resign if the order is not withdrawn.Although the BJP had won the Ladakh parliamentary seat in 2014, it suffered huge reverses when several senior party leaders - including its local parliamentarian - resigned in November.The government's decision has also given rise to a butterfly effect, with demands for separate administrative divisions cropping up from Jammu's Pirpanjal and Chenab Valley. While the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party strongly back the creation of separate divisions for these regions, the BJP is vehemently opposed to it.The decision on separating Ladakh from the Kashmir division was taken less than a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Leh.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

The protesters blocked the entry of newly-appointed divisional commissioner of Ladkah into Kargil and forced him to go back to Leh.Jammu and Kashmir is under President's Rule. The decision on separating Ladkah region from Kashmir division was taken less than a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Leh. The BJP had won Ladakh parliament seat in 2014 elections but suffered huge reverses after its local lawmaker and several other senior leaders from Ladakh resigned from party in November last.The party is desperately trying to regain the lost ground before upcoming elections. While the decision was welcomed in Leh, the party is facing revolt in Kargil. It has also led to demands for separate administrative divisions in Pirpanjal and Chenab Valley regions. The National Conference and PDP are strongly supporting separate divisions for these regions but the BJP has vehemently opposed it.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

""We will go meet (BJP chief) Amit Shah when he comes to Jaipur, to ask him to have this passed"".Last month, the Centre had passed the bill that provided for 10 per cent reservation in jobs and education for the economically weaker sections in the general category. The bill was introduced as a constitutional amendment, which made the quota legally valid.The Gujjar agitation flared up soon after, with the community pointing out that the Congress had promised five per cent reservation to them in its election manifesto.The Gujjars, who comprise around 5 per cent of Rajasthan's population and are traditional supporters of the BJP, have been demanding quota since 2006. Although covered under the quota for Other Backward Classes, they demanded an extra 5 per cent quota for the community.Efforts have been made twice by BJP-led governments in the state to grant that quota under various heads. But it has been repeatedly struck down by the Rajasthan High Court.The last such effort was made in 2017, when the Vasundhara Raje government gave Gujjars 5 per cent reservation as a Most Backward Class and expanded the OBC quota to 26 per cent.""We know that five per cent reservation has been overturned in the past. But now the circumstances are different,"" said Mr Pilot. ""The Centre has just crossed the 50 per cent limit. The path has been cleared"".The Congress has added a line to the Rajasthan Backward Classes Bill that says since the Centre has given 10 per cent reservation to the EWS sections in the General Category, the Rajasthan government proposes 5 per cent quota for the Most Backward Castes, which would include Gujjars and four other nomadic tribes.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

As the top Congress leaders protested, paper jets were seen.TheCongress leaders raised slogansagainst Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government before the report of national auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), was submitted in parliament today. TheRafale deal signed by PM Modi's government is 2.8 per cent cheaperthan the one negotiated by previous Congress-led UPA government, says the report.Rahul Gandhi had slammed the CAG report, calling it ""Chowkidar(gatekeeper) Auditor General"" report. The CAG report does not include the controversial and key point of pricing, as the Defence Ministry maintained that these details could not be revealed. The parts in the report referring to cost are redacted, which may provoke fresh opposition attacks.Earlier today, the Congress president cited a report inThe Hinduto claim that theprime minister's argument of better pricingand faster delivery of the jets to defend the deal has been ""demolished"".The PM defended his personal RAFALE bypass deal on 2 counts :1.

A spokesperson says the industrialist visited France to discuss a deal for more than 100 Naval Utility Helicopters for which the government had sought information from international helicopter manufacturers in 2015.The Congress alleges that the government went for an overpriced deal for Rafale jets to benefit Anil Ambani, whose Reliance Defence is one of the offset partners for Rafale maker Dassault. Both Dassault and Anil Ambani have denied the Congress allegations.The Supreme Court in December refused to investigate the deal worth an alleged 8.7 billion dollars and rejected petitions that alleged corruption, including the choice of Anil Ambani's firm as domestic partner.

A Gujjar leader warned that nobody will leave till their demands are met.""We will leave only after getting 5 per cent reservation. I would request the government not to do anything which can provoke the people of Rajasthan. People are waiting for my instructions. Let's sort it out in a peaceful manner. The sooner the better,"" Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla said today.The Congress had promised the Gujjars 5 per cent reservation in its election manifesto and it is now bound to deliver, say protesters.Scores of people from the Gujjar community in Rajasthan, led by the Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (GASS), have beenprotesting at railway tracks at Sawai Madhopurdemanding implementation of the 5 per cent reservation that was promised to them by the state government. They have even set up tents around the tracks.The protest has severely affected traffic on the highways and train movement along the Delhi-Mumbai line. The agitation turned violent on Sunday as the protesters clashed with the police personnel near Dholpur, officials said. They have blocked the Agra National Highway near Sikandara today.Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehloton Sunday said that his government was ready to hold talks with Gujjars, but condemned the violence and disruption of road and train traffic.""The government is ready to open discussions but sitting on railway tracks as part of protest is unethical,"" Mr Gehlot said and urged them to submit a memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""We did our best for them during my last tenure as the chief minister. We spoke to them and introduced 1 per cent reservation for the Gujjar community. We also tried to give them 5 per cent reservation. However, the High Court cancelled the same. Now they can start discussions with the Centre for 5 per cent reservation as it requires constitutional amendments,"" Mr Gehlot said.A Rajasthan minister also urged the protesters not to resort to violence and protest peacefully. ""I would also like to appeal to Bainslajito send his team for dialogue, and we will discuss as to how their demands can be met within limits of the constitution,"" Bhanwar Lal, the minister, said according to news agency ANI.Like the chief minister, Mr Lal also tried to steer the protesters towards the centre. ""We're not saying no, but our government is only 45-day-old. I would urge the Gujjar community to pressurise the Prime Minister to give five per cent reservation, the way they gave 10 per cent reservation to the general category,"" he said.Ahead of the general elections, a bill to provide 10 per cent quota in jobs and education to candidates who belong to the economically weaker sections in the general category, was passed by both the Houses last month. The latest law on this triggered the Gujjar agitation.According to the police, unidentified men fired around 10 shots in the air during the blockade on Agra-Morena highway on Sunday. When protesters threw stones, the police had to fire tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. Five policemen were injured and three police vehicles, including a bus, were also set on fire. No arrests have been made so far, a senior police officer said.Section 144 has been imposed in Dholpur, Dausa, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur and Karauli after violence being reported on Sunday.According to the railway authorities, as many as 18 trains were cancelled in Kota division of Central-West Railway on Sunday. The Railways has already announced cancellation of 37 trains between February 11 and 13.The Rajasthan government led by Vasundhara Raje had assured the Gujjar community of 5 per cent reservation in a special category in 2017 after a bout of agitation. It had planned to expand the reservation for Other Backward Classes from 21 per cent to 26 per cent and to give 5 per cent reservation to Gujjars and other castes. After the expansion, however, the total reservation in the state would have crossed the 50 per cent ceiling set by the Supreme Court.The bill to this effect, which was introduced in the monsoon session of the state assembly in 2017, was put on hold by the Rajasthan High Court after an appeal against it.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Mr Naidu accused the Narendra Modi government of going back on a long-awaited promise of special state status for Andhra Pradesh which would grant it a greater share of funds.Chandrababu Naidu said the hunger strike was organised to ask PM Modi why he had not kept his word on Andhra Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, had claimed on Sunday that he had gone far beyond offering the special status to Andhra Pradesh.

Two days after the government issued the controversial order, thousands of Kargil residents marched in thebone-chilling coldto demand that the decision be reviewed immediately. They have refused to be part of the newly created division unless there is six-month rotation of offices between Leh and Kargil.According to the order, the administration has sanctioned the creation of a separate administrative and revenue division comprising Leh and Kargil districts with its headquarters at Leh. Ladakh was part of Kashmir division until now.""Give it to Leh district if you want to, but then let Kargil remain part of Kashmir division. This is absolute injustice, and we will not accept this. The decision must be reviewed, and the headquarters should be on six-month rotation,"" said Feroz Ahmad Khan, Chief Executive Councillor of the Ladakh Area Hill Development Council, Kargil.All elected leaders from Kargil, including Mr Khan, have threatened to resign if the order is not withdrawn. They claim that the demand for a separate Ladakh division had actually been made by the people of Kargil, and the government's decision to install the divisional headquarters at Leh was done with the aim of creating political strife in the region.Meanwhile, largescale agitations are being taken out in Kargil, and temperatures as low as minus 21 degrees Celsius are doing little to deter them. All political, social and religious organisations in the region have called for a shutdown tomorrow, and threatened to launch an agitation if the decision is not reviewed.The government's decision has led to other repercussions too, with demands for separate administrative divisions cropping up from Jammu's Pirpanjal and Chenab Valley too. While the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party strongly back the creation of separate divisions for these regions, the BJP is vehemently opposed to it.The decision on separating Ladakh from the Kashmir division was taken less than a weekafter Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Leh. Although the BJP had won the Ladakh parliamentary seat in 2014, it suffered huge reverses when several senior party leaders - including its local parliamentarian - resigned in November.The party is desperately trying to regain lost ground before the upcoming elections. While the decision has been welcomed in Leh, it faces huge opposition in Kargil.

But when we see the kind of letters (being issued by the diocese PRO and Missionaries of Jesus congregation head), we doubt whether Bishop Franco still wields power in the diocese,"" the representative of the protesting nuns told reporters at Kuravilangad near Kottayam.Their statement comes a day after Jalandhar diocese PRO Father Peter Kavumpuram, who is allegedly close to Bishop Mulakkal,issued a clarificationstatement countering an e-mail issued to nuns by its apostolic administrator Bishop Angelo Ruffino Gracias.In his e-mail,Bishop Angelo had assured the five nuns, who are staying with the rape survivor nun, that ""there will be no move from the diocese of Jalandhar to oust"" them from the Kuravilangad convent in Kottayam district as long as they are needed for the court case.The Bishop wrote to the nuns after they complained to him against the head of their congregation, Missionaries of Jesus under the Jalandhar diocese, for issuing transfer orders to the four of them who took part in the protest demanding the arrest of the bishop.Another nun, who is staying with the rape survivor, was asked to report to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation's Jalandhar convent and meet its Superior General Sister Regina Kandamthottu on January 26.Peter Kavumpuram issued a clarification statement countering Bishop Angelo hours after his e-mail communication was made public, saying even though the congregation of Missionaries of Jesus is of diocesan right, the internal running of the congregation is left to the Superior General and her council.""The Bishop of Jalandhar does not normally interfere unless the overall interests of the church demand such interference. By this clarification the Apostolic Administrator has not interfered in the internal affairs of this congregation, therefore the order to return to their rightful communities by the Mother General is not cancelled but stands,"" the statement quoting Father Kavumpuram had said.The protesting nuns stay with the survivor nun in the convent in Kuravilangad.Talking to reporters today, the nun representing the protesters rejected the clarification statement issued by Father Kavumpuram, saying they would not move out of the convent in Kuravilangad.""Clarification statement is not acceptable for us. We will continue to stay in this convent till the case is over,"" she said.The congregation of nuns -- Missionaries of Jesus -- had directed the nuns to join their previously-assigned convents, according to the transfer orders issued between March and May last year.The nuns were served notice by the superior general, urging them to take up their assigned responsibilities as befitting members of the congregation.The four nuns had earlier written to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking his intervention to ensure that their transfer orders were not effected till the trial of the case was over.The survivor nun had also written a separate letter to the chief minister, seeking his help in the matter.""Their aim is to single me out and to harass and torture me. My life will be in danger if such a situation arises,"" she said in her letter.The nuns on Saturday had joined ''Save our Sisters'' forum to stage a protest against the transfer orders issued by the congregation.A tense situation prevailed at the protest site when a group of people opposing the nuns'' protest reached there and raised slogans against them.The group was removed from the spot, police sources said.The protest led by the nuns and the Catholic reformist forums in Kochi in September last year had led to a public outrage and demands for action against the bishop.Bishop Mulakkal, a senior member of the Roman Catholic clergy in India, was arrested last year following allegations by a nun that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted her at the Kuravilangad convent between 2014 and 2016, a charge denied by him.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Interior Minister Christophe Castaner expressed his ""indignation and disgust"" in a tweet.A man was being held for questioning over the blaze, Paris prosecutors said.Volunteer medics at the National Assembly told AFP that a man had had his hand ripped off during the clashes between police and protesters.One witness who filmed the incident, 21-year-old Cyprien Royer, said the victim was a yellow jacket photographer taking pictures of people trying to break down the barriers protecting the entrance to the National Assembly.He said he was hit in the calf by a type of stun grenade as the cops attempted to disperse people.""He wanted to bat it away so it didn't explode by his leg -- and it went off when he touched it,"" he added.Paris police said the man had lost four fingers.Officers had arrested 39 people and 21 were being held in custody, they added on Saturday night.Disputed Turnout""We mustn't give up,"" said pensioner Serge Mairesse, from Aubervilliers, just outside Paris. This was the 11th time he had marched with the movement, he told AFP.""We have to win to have more social and fiscal justice in this country,"" said Mairesse, who was carrying a placard calling for the reimposition of a wealth tax on high earners repealed by Macron.At the march in the southeast city of Lyon, Benard, a 56-year-old computer technician, expressed scepticism about Macron's ""great debate"" initiative designed to address people's grievances.""It's all very good, the great debate, but we want something concrete: fewer taxes, more purchasing power. We'll be here every Saturday of the year if we have to.""Thousands of protesters turned out Saturday in the French Mediterranean ports of Marseille and Montpellier and also in Bordeaux and Toulouse in the southwest -- strongholds of the movements -- as well as several cities in the north and west of France.In the eastern city of Saint Etienne, eight police officers were slightly hurt during clashes with some protesters on the fringes of the march there, local police said.Interior ministry figures put the turnout across France at 51,400, of whom 4,000 marched in Paris, slightly down on the previous week's figures.But last week's official estimates were disputed both by march organisers and contradicted by an independent estimate carried out for news media, which gave a higher estimate.The first yellow vest day of protest in November brought 282,000 people out on to the streets across France, according to government figures.But a YouGov poll of 1,037 people issued on Thursday suggested that nearly two out of three people in France (64 percent) still support the movement.

Without naming any party, he said ""Those who sit in AC rooms in Delhi"" are spreading ""misinformation"" about the bill.The Citizenship Bill, one of the key projects of the government, envisages a smoother and quicker grant of citizenship to illegal migrants from the minority communities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after six years' stay in India.But it has had the northeast -- an area sensitive to the preservation of culture that entry of foreigners may endanger -- up in arms.The protests have spiked particularly in Assam, where inflow of illegal migrants from Bangladesh is a huge social and political issue.PM Modi earlier provided a broader context to the issue, saying those the bill would help are also ""children of Ma Bharati"".""Be it from Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Bangladesh... they were all a part of India once... but after partition, when the country was divided, they became minorities in their own country, be it Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis, Christians, and Hindus... We must understand the pain of these people... they must now get their recognition as Indian citizens,"" he said today.The Congress has taken on the BJP over the Citizenship Bill, pointing out that while considering candidates for citizenship, the Bill only looks at religious persecution, not social or political discrimination.But the Prime Minister today took on the Congress, reminding the people that in the last 35 years, the Clause 6 of the Assam Accord -- which promises comprehensive safeguards to the cultural, social and linguistic identity -- has not been implemented.Before the BJP won the 2016 assembly elections, the Congress had ruled the state for 15 straight years. For 10 of those years, the party ruled at the Centre too.The row over the Citizenship Bill is seen to be a growing hurdle for the BJP in the northeast, which has a crucial role in PM Modi's ""Look East policy"" - the expansion of strategic ties across southeast Asia. From practically no footprint in the area, the BJP has managed to bring all seven states under its control over the last four years.But in the few short months since the bill was introduced, unrest has been spreading among the BJP allies in the northeast.Regional ally Asom Gana Parishad has ended its partnership with the BJP over the bill, which has already been passed by the Lok Sabha and could be tabled soon in the Rajya Sabha. Ten of its allies have decided to oppose the bill, indicating that if the Centre does not bend, they would walk out of the 13-party Northeast Democratic Alliance -the anti-Congress platform through which the BJP made inroads in the northeast. Even some of the BJP's own leaders in the area have spoken against the bill.Today, PM Modi detailed the initiatives that show his government's emphasis on the northeast.""I am proud that under the BJP, two great personalities from Assam, Gopinath Bordoloi and Bhupen Hazarika were given Bharat Ratna. Our objective is 'infrapush northeast, digital push northeast'. In the interim budget, we have given a lot of emphasis on the development of the northeast. We have given 21 per cent hike in allocation for the northeast.

Indian Doctors In UK Protest Doubling Of Healthcare Surcharge On Migrants,https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indian-doctors-in-uk-protest-doubling-of-healthcare-surcharge-on-migrants-1991148,"The ""Immigration Health Surcharge"" was introduced in April 2015 and from December last year it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year.",https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-05/doctor-generic_650x400_51525683359.jpg,"UK-based Indian doctors and healthcare professionals are campaigning against what they describe as an ""unfair"" doubling of a health surcharge imposed on professionals from outside European Union (EU) living and working in Britain.The ""Immigration Health Surcharge"" was introduced in April 2015 and from December last year it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year.It is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the country's state-funded National Health Service (NHS).The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), the UK's largest representative body for Indian-origin doctors, is lobbying the UK Home Office for a rethink over the charge, arguing that it would have an adverse impact on their attempt to recruit more healthcare professionals from India to meet staff shortages in the NHS.""Clinicians wishing to work in the UK are already facing burdensome processes relating to regulation and immigration, and this surcharge is only going to see UK losing out on quality healthcare professionals from non-EU countries,"" notes a letter from BAPIO president Ramesh Mehta and secretary Parag Singhal, sent to UK home secretary Sajid Javid last week.""The current policy adversely affects the attraction of working in the NHS and will sabotage our own requirements of providing quality health services to our patients. Therefore, in the interest of patient safety and improved morale of the immigrant workforce, we request that this unfair and highly discriminatory health surcharge for NHS-employed professionals should be reversed with immediate effect,"" the letter states.According to the organisation, one in 11 NHS clinical posts are currently unfilled, rising to one in eight for nursing vacancies, and the severe shortage is likely to grow to around 250,000 by 2030.Doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals from countries like India are often referred to as the ""backbone"" of the UK's healthcare system as they take up critical posts across hospitals and clinics in the country, the BAPIO pointed out.BAPIO has been at the centre of organising fellowship programmes for doctors from India to fill NHS shortages while completing their training in Britain as a ""win-win"" arrangement.But it fears these efforts would be hit as a result of the additional financial burden imposed by the health surcharge.""These professionals are paying their taxes, including National Insurance (NI) contributions, in addition to providing quality health services in over-stretched hospitals. Such an additional burden will make them feel demoralised and discriminated,"" said Prof. Singhal.The health surcharge is payable by nationals from countries like India if they seek to live in the UK for six months or more, or to extend their stay.The payment is made at the time the immigration application is made and is payable annually until such time as the person is granted indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK, or returns to their home country at the end of their visa period.Short-term migrants, including tourists on visitor visas, are charged differently for secondary care treatment by the NHS at the point of visa access.Other groups have also questioned the extremely high surcharge on the grounds that it amounted to ""double taxation"" for long-term migrants, who are already expected to make tax contributions towards the care system.""Most people who do move here will work and they will pay tax. So doubling this charge is a form of double taxation. People are going to be ending up paying for the NHS twice,"" said Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Migrants.The UK government says since the surcharge was introduced in 2015, it has raised over 600 million pounds, which has been ploughed back into health budgets.It expects to raise an estimated 220 million pounds in extra funding with the doubling of the surcharge, with the funds aimed at ""sustaining and protecting"" the country''s healthcare system.""We welcome use of the NHS by long term residents who still need leave to remain, but we believe it is right that they make a fair and proportionate contribution to its long-term sustainability,"" a UK Home Office spokesperson said.""Parliament agrees and has approved the order we proposed to increase the immigration health surcharge so it better reflects the actual costs to the NHS,"" the spokesperson added.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Agitating Gujjars sat on railway tracks at Malarna Doongar near Sawai Madhopur, leading to the cancellation of 23 trains and the re-routing of 20 today.The PRO of the Western Central Railway told NDTV that some cancellations may be restored if the situation gets better.The blocked railway line in the West Central Railway connects Delhi to Mumbai. The Delhi-Jaipur-Agra line, however, remains clear.North Western Railway (NWR) Chief Public Relations Officer Abhay Sharma said three trains, including Hazrat Nizamuddin-Ahmedabad, Hazrat Nizamuddin-Udaipur and Udaipur-Hazrat Nizamuddin were cancelled whereas Firozpur Cantt-Mumbai train was was diverted.So far, no untoward incident has been reported due to the Gujjar agitation. ""Our teams are alert and the deadlock may soon be over after today's meeting with the committee constituted by the government,"" news agency PTI quoted DGP (Law and order) ML Lather.Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla started a dharna yesterday along with his supporters on the railway tracks in Rajasthan's Sawai Madhopur district, demanding reservation for five communities including Gujjars.He said the government had promised five per cent reservation to the community in its election manifesto so the state government was liable to give the same ""so that the people can return home gracefully"".Vijay Bainsla, another Gujjar leader, said they have been waiting for talks with the government since last 20 days on their demand. He said agitators blocked Jaipur-Delhi, Jodhpur-Bhilwara, Ajmer-Bhilwara highway on Saturday.The agitation comes nearly a month after 10 per cent quota for the economically weaker sections in the general category in jobs and education was cleared by parliament. The move was introduced as a constitutional amendment, passed in parliament and enacted in a matter of days.However, the validity of the 10 per cent quota will be examined by the Supreme Court. The government has argued that since the bill provides reservation on basis of income, not caste, it was not subject to the 50 per cent bar.The agitation comes nearly a month after 10 per cent quota for the economically weaker sections in the general category in jobs and education was cleared by parliament.""We have a good chief minister and a good prime minister. We want that they listen to the demands of Gujjar community. It isn't an uphill task for them to provide reservation,"" an agitating member of the Gujjar community told news agency ANI.The Gujjars say if 10 per cent reservation for the economically backward can be passed, then why not for them.""We want 5 per cent reservation. The government hasn't responded to my request. So, I am going to start an agitation,"" Mr Bainsla told news agency ANI.The Rajasthan government has formed a three-member committee comprising cabinet ministers Raghu Sharma, Vishvendra Singh and Master Bhanwar Lal to lead talks with the Gujjar community.The Rajasthan government had assured the Gujjar community of 5 per cent reservation in a special category in 2017 after a bout of agitation. It had planned to expand the reservation for Other Backward Classes from 21 per cent to 26 per cent and give 5 per cent reservation to Gujjars and other castes. After the expansion, the total reservation in the state would have crossed the 50 per cent ceiling set by the Supreme Court.The bill to this effect, which was introduced in the monsoon session of the state assembly in 2017, was put on hold by the Rajasthan High Court after an appeal against it.The community has held four agitations for reservations from 2007 up to 2015, where they blocked rail and road traffic. In 2007 and 2008, more than 70 people had died in the clashes during the agitation. In 2010 and 2015 though, only rail and road traffic was disrupted.(With inputs from PTI and ANI)Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

I like to assure the five of you that as far as lies within my power, there will be no move from the Diocese of Jalandhar to oust you from the convent as long as you are needed for the court case.""The nuns in Kerala had received their transfer orders in March 2018 by the Missionaries of Jesus Congregation, months after they had complained at several forums within the church against the bishop.

Our demand is simple - we should be left  in peace, to live in the convent together , till we are fighting the case in the court"", one of the nuns told NDTV.The nuns announced the development during a protest organised by Save Our Sisters on Saturday in Kottayam as they demanded justice for the ""survivor"" nun. The nuns had earlier protested near Kerala High Court in September last year.Save Our Sisters, an umbrella organisation of several 'reformation organisations' within churches, has demanded that Franco Mullakkal must be 'defrocked'.

There is someone who follows Christ,"" the joint Convenor of SOS Shaiju Antony told NDTV.""The catholic church is spending millions and holding an important meeting in Rome in February on the clerical sex abuse crisis and child protection, but why leave out abuse against women. We need strong laws within churches to deal with this too."" Dr Kochurani Abraham , a leading woman theologian told NDTV.Bishop Mulakkal is accused of raping a nun on 14 occasions from 2014 to 2016, at the St Francis Mission Home in Kuruvilangad.

The house will reconvene on Friday morning, when Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy is scheduled to present the state budget.The question over the government's majority arises largely because of the absence of several legislators belonging to the Congress - the JDS's coalition partner in the state.Despite being ordered by Congress Legislature Party chief Siddaramaiah to be present in the House, many legislators continue to stay away. These include four Congress MLAs - Ramesh Jarkiholi, Umesh Jadhav, B Nagendra and Mahesh Kumathihalli - who had also absented themselves from the Congress Legislature Party meet called in December. Another legislator, KN Ganesh, is on the run because he is wanted by police for allegedly assaulting fellow-Congressman Anand Singh.As no Congress MLA has resigned from the party so far, the coalition still officially has 118 MLAs in a House with a halfway mark of 113. The Congress leadership insists that all party MLAs will be present for the budget.The JDS also asserted that the budget will be presented on schedule. ""In the May 2018 election, the people of the state gave the BJP 104 seats. We formed a coalition with the Congress because 113 seats are needed. The BJP should play the role of a responsible opposition, but they are instead offering Rs 50 crore and Rs 100 crore to our legislators. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah support this,"" alleged Karnataka Minister GT Deve Gowda.The JDS leader criticised the BJP for disrupting assembly proceedings. ""They did not allow the Governor -- the very Governor appointed by the centre -- to make his address. Operation Kamala has failed, and the entire country is watching what the BJP is doing. The budget will be presented tomorrow and everything will be passed. Why don't they move a no-confidence motion instead of disrupting the proceedings?"" Mr Gowda asked.He was referring to an incident on Wednesday, when BJP legislators trooped into the well of the house and loudly called on Governor Vajubhai Vala to not deliver his address. ""You are made to read lies, so please don't read it,"" a few of them were heard shouting.BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa defended his legislators, and insisted that the government does not have a majority. ""Karnataka has seen little development in the last eight months, and that is why we boycotted the Governor's address yesterday. The question of moving a no-confidence motion does not arise at all,"" the former Chief Minister said.BJP member R Ashok has alleged that superstitious beliefs are behind the ruling coalition's decision to present the budget presentation just after 12.30 pm on Friday. ""The budget has always been presented at 11 or 12 o'clock, never like this. This particular time was fixed by HD Revanna, Mr Kumaraswamy's brother, who always has a lemon (to ward off the evil eye) in his possession,"" he said.Mr Ashok then went on to claim that everything done by the Congress-JDS government is based on superstitious beliefs. ""Where is the money for farm loans - the Rs 40,000 crore farm loan waiver they promised? There is no money. Tomorrow is an astrology budget that's not for the public. There is no government in Karnataka.""Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Gujjars Demanding Quota Block Tracks In Rajasthan; Delhi-Mumbai Route Hit,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gujjars-demanding-quota-block-tracks-in-rajasthan-delhi-mumbai-route-hit-1990621,"The Gujjars say if 10 per cent reservation for the economically backward can be passed, then why not for them.",,"Hundreds of people from the Gujjar community in Rajasthan are protesting at railway tracks at Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan, demanding implementation of the 5 per cent reservation that was promised to them by the state government. The protest has affected the train movement on the Delhi-Mumbai line.While four trains have been terminated earlier than their destination, seven have been diverted and one cancelled by Railways keeping in mind the agitation.The protesters marched to the tracks in Sawai Madhopur, about 150 km from state capital Jaipur, this evening.""We want 5 per cent reservation. The government hasn't responded to my request. So, I am going to start an agitation,"" Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla told news agency ANI.The state government has formed a three member committee, all cabinet ministers, to lead talks with the Gujjar community.Today's agitation comes nearly a month after 10 per cent quota for the economically weaker sections in the general category in jobs and education was cleared by parliament. The move was introduced as a constitutional amendment, passed in parliament and enacted in a matter of days.However, the validity of the 10 per cent quota will be examined by the Supreme Court. The government has argued that since the bill provides reservation on basis of income, not caste, it was not subject to the 50 per cent bar.The Gujjars say if 10 per cent reservation for the economically backward can be passed, then why not for them.The Rajasthan government had assured the Gujjar community of 5 per cent reservation in a special category in 2017 after a bout of agitation. It had planned to expand the reservation for Other Backward Classes from 21 per cent to 26 per cent and give 5 per cent reservation to Gujjars and other castes. After the expansion, the total reservation in the state would have crossed the 50 per cent ceiling set by the Supreme Court.The bill to this effect, which was introduced in the monsoon session of the state assembly in 2017, was put on hold by the Rajasthan High Court after an appeal against it.The community has held four agitations for reservations from 2007 up to 2015, where they blocked rail and road traffic. In 2007 and 2008, more than 70 people had died in the clashes during the agitation. In 2010 and 2015 though, only rail and road traffic was disrupted.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Mamata Banerjee Ends 3-Day,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-ends-3-day-protest-over-cbi-action-against-kolkata-top-cop-1988785,West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee ended her three-day protest on Tuesday over the CBI's action against Kolkata's top police officer Rajeev Kumar.,,
Mamata Banerjee Turns Street Fighter For Cop She Once Refused To Trust,https://www.ndtv.com/people/kolkata-police-commissioner-rajeev-kumar-profile-mamata-banerjee-turns-street-fighter-for-cop-she-on-1988791,"An IPS officer of the 1989 batch, 53-year-old Rajeev Kumar, who holds an engineering degree in computer science from IIT Roorkee, is a native of Uttar Pradesh.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-02/59s36ldg_mamata-rajeev_625x300_04_February_19.jpg,"During her days in the opposition, Mamata Banerjee had accused an IPS officer of tapping the phones of political rivals of the ruling Left Front. A decade down the line, she is staging a dharna to protest the CBI's bid to question him.Meet Rajeev Kumar, the Kolkata police commissioner, known for his impeccable investigating and electronic surveillance skills, who was once a blue eyed boy of former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya.Ms Banerjee had then accused Mr Kumar of snooping on telephonic conversations of opposition leaders, an allegation rejected by the then Left Front government.An IPS officer of the 1989 batch, 53-year-old Mr Kumar, who holds an engineering degree in computer science from IIT Roorkee, is a native of Uttar Pradesh.During his impressive career, Mr Kumar has held important positions including those of Joint Commissioner (Special Task Force) and Director General (CID).It was under him that the STF of Kolkata Police became a byword for terror for several top Maoists leaders and notorious criminals.He was instrumental in the arrest of Chattaradhar Mahato, the much-feared convenor of People's Committee Against Police Atrocities, a frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist), at the height of Lalgarh movement. Kumar''s officers disguised as journalist had arrested Mahato.The tribals of Lalgarh, backed by Maoists, had begun a movement in the region against alleged police atrocities over a decade-and-half ago. They had targeted the then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee''s convoy at Salboni in Paschim Medinipur, prompting the government to launch a massive crackdown to flush out the rebels.Former Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar, in his book ''Dial D for Don'', reminisced how Rajeev Kumar, then SSP (CID), did extensive work after the American Center attack in 2001 and the high-profile kidnapping case of Khadim shoe company's CEO Partha Pratim Roy Burman. The former Delhi police boss was full of praise for Mr Kumar.Former IPS officers say Mr Kumar always stood by his subordinates.""He always stood by his men and officers. He is a team leader in the true sense,"" a former IPS officer said, adding he enjoys ""immense respect"" among the rank and file of the Kolkata police force.In 2011, when Mamata Banerjee''s Trinamool Congress came to power ending the 34-year Left Front rule, she wanted Mr Kumar to be shunted to some insignificant position. She was, however, dissuaded by senior police officers from taking such a course.Over the next eight years a lot of water has flown down the Howrah bridge.In January 2012, when Bidhannagar Police Commissionarate was formed, Rajeev Kumar was appointed its first commissioner.When the Saradha chit fund scam was busted in 2013, thousands of collection agents for the company converged at the TMC headquarters and demanded action against its chairman Sudipta Sen. The first cases against the group were lodged under the jurisdiction of Bidhannagar police commissionerate.Mr Kumar and his team arrested Mr Sen and his partner in crime Debjani Mukherjee from Jammu and Kashmir on April 18, 2013. The state government formed a special investigation team (SIT) under him to probe the fraud which saw lakhs of depositors getting duped of their hard earned money with the promise of abnormally high returns.It was during his stint as SIT chief that he grew closer to the ruling dispensation.His proximity to the establishment also brought with it criticism, as opposition parties accused the SIT of trying to destroy evidences against ruling TMC leaders and stalling the probe.In November 2013, rebel TMC MP Kunal Ghosh was arrested by the SIT.A CBI probe into the chit fund scam was ordered by the Supreme Court in May 2014 on a petition by senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan.Meanwhile, the TMC dispensation elevated him as Additional Director General of CID.During his tenure as ADG (CID) he outsmarted the CBI and arrested the first accused in the case of rape of a 70-year-old nun. The nun was raped by a gang of seven dacoits inside a Convent in Nadia district on March 14, 2015.Amid growing outrage, the state government had decided to hand over the case to the CBI on March 18, 2015. But before the federal probe agency could lay its hands on the perpetrators, Mr Kumar arrested the first accused on March 26.He took over as 21st police commissioner of Kolkata on February 2016, the year the state had its last assembly polls.A month later, two officers of Kolkata police, disguised as cow smugglers, tried to bribe BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha to help them in their trade. The incident happened just a fortnight after Narada news released sting videos showing Trinamool Congress leaders purportedly accepting money from a fictitious company.In April that year, the Election Commission decided to replace Kumar with Somen Mitra. Once back in power, Mamata Banerjee reinstated Mr Kumar.Last September, a series of audio clips of purported telephone conversations between Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP general secretary in charge of West Bengal, and Mukul Roy, a former confidante of Ms Banerjee and now a frontline leader of the BJP, started doing the rounds in social media.The clips included a conversation where Mr Roy purportedly asked Mr Vijayvargiya to talk to BJP president Amit Shah and get the CBI to keep a ""watch"" on four IPS officers serving in the state so as to ""scare"" them.Mr Roy had then alleged that their phones were tapped by Kolkata police, which rejected the allegations.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

However, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavissaid he was ""certain"" of a pre-poll alliancewith the Shiv Sena.""We do have our differences with Mamata Banerjee and her party, but she is, indeed, hitting back at the Centre with equal force,"" the Sena remarked.The Sena said the centre could have acted against the Kolkata Police chief two months back and the CBI should have carried proper summons before visiting his house to question him.It also said Narendra Modi should look in to the crisis in Bengal as a prime minister of the country and not as a leader of the BJP.The Shiv Sena is a constituent of the BJP-led ruling coalitions in Maharashtra and also at the Centre, but it routinely criticises its alliance partner's leaders and government policies.Mamata Banerjee's sit-in protest entered its third day today amid the Supreme Court listing the matter for next hearing on February 20. The court also directed that Rajeev Kumar,the police chief cannot be arrestedand will be questioned in the Rose Valley and Saradha cases in Shillong.(with inputs from PTI)Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

""Circumstances indicate that this cop knows a lot and therefore has to be saved,"" Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.Mr Roy had been one of the leaders questioned in the Saradha Ponzi scheme that gypped lakhs of small investors of their savings, over which at least four lawmakers, including ministers, have been arrested.Four years ago, he was also questioned by the CBI for what is referred to as the ""Narada scam"" after the website that conducted the alleged expose on a group of Trinamool leaders. Twelve leaders were accused of accepting cash in a sting by a journalist posing as a businessman and seeking favours from Trinamool.""I am not guilty. I was interrogated when I was in the TMC. Investigation should go on and guilty should be punished,"" Mr Roy told NDTV.There were apprehensions when Mr Roy quit the party in September 2017, peeved over the ascendancy Ms Banerjee was giving to her nephew Abhishek Banerjee.In the months leading to his parting ways with the Trinamool, Mr Roy had been removed as the party's in-charge of Tripura. The party was seen as steadily making gains in the Left-dominated state till all its six legislators in the state switched to the BJP in August. He was last put in charge of Punjab.Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee had said, ""Under pressure from central agencies, for his own self-interest, Mukul Roy was trying to hurt the party from within"". There was suspicion that the leader was being provided immunity from investigation by the BJP in exchange for information that could compromise his party colleagues.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Why Mamata Banerjee's Protest Doesn't Scream Opposition Unity To BJP,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/why-mamata-banerjees-protest-doesnt-scream-opposition-unity-to-bjp-1987833,Lok Sabha Elections 2019: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's protest against the centre has added one more layer to the BJP vs opposition battle.,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-01/edfank2g_mamata-banerjee-kolkata-rally-reuters_625x300_19_January_19.jfif,"Eighteen and counting. Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of Bengal, has received the support of these many leaders, tweeted her top aide Derek O' Brien this morning along with a list that featured Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Arvind Kejriwal and Tejashwi Yadav. Ahead of the national election, Mamata Banerjee's ""satyagraha"" against the centre has added one more layer to the BJP vs opposition battle.""All of us together,"" posted the Trinamool Congress leader, thanking all the leaders.All of us together Thank u@H_D_Devegowda@RahulGandhiBehen MayawatiJi@mkstalin@yadavakhilesh@ncbn@ArvindKejriwal@Pawarspeaks@laluprasadrjd@OmarAbdullah@MehboobaMufti@YaswantSinha@yadavtejashwi@HemantSorenJMM@HardikPatel_@DrAMSinghvi@SharadYadavMP@jigneshmevani80pic.twitter.com/14mKjPqZEHLeaders likeArvind Kejriwal, the chief of the Aam Aadmi Party, may even travel to Kolkatato join her in the protest. However, many in the BJP pointed at the innate contradictions in the show of unity and scoffed at suggestions that this could be a rallying point for the opposition ahead of the general election.Hours after Congress presidentRahul Gandhi said he stood ""shoulder-to-shoulder""withMamata Banerjee in her fight against the central governmentfor sending CBI officers to question her police chief Rajeev Kumar, his party's top leader in Bengal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, voiced the opposite.""This is a scam in which many people were duped and the investigation is being done after the Supreme Court order. After Bengal government's order the police stopped CBI. I have not seen such thing. So there is a constitutional crisis in Bengal and the central government must come forward to stop this constitutional crisis,' said Mr Chowdhury, a Congress lawmaker and former state Congress chief.Not long ago, Mr Chowdhury's party president shared his views. In 2016, while campaigning for the Bengal elections, Rahul Gandhi had targeted Mamata Banerjee over the very cases at the heart of her clash with the centre. ""Mamatajihad promised to wipe out corruption in the state. But when corruption took place in front of her, she took no action,"" said Rahul Gandhi, then Congress number two, referring to the Saradha scam.Similarly, the Congress is not in the Akhilesh Yadav-Mayawati club in Uttar Pradesh, even though they all have pledged their support to Mamata Banerjee.Mamata Banerjee sat on protest after the showdown with CBI officials.The Left, caught between its role as an opposition bloc and its intrinsic conflict with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, attacked both the BJP and the West Bengal Chief Minister. ""This drama in Kolkata by the BJP and TMC (Trinamool) is not a fight for any principle but only to save their corrupt and hide their corruption. CPI(M) has fought both these undemocratic, corrupt, communal and dictatorial regimes in the centre and the state and will continue to do so,"" tweeted CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury.Most of the opposition parties who have come out in Mamata Banerjee's support were seen at her unity show in Kolkata a few weeks ago.Two prominent players who did not attend that mega opposition meet, Odisha Chief Minister Navin Patnaik and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, have remained silent in the current controversy.

Madhya Pradesh's former police chief will lead the country's top investigating agency, it was decided on Saturday despite protests by one of the members of the selection committee led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, the opposition member of the collegium, objected to 1983-batch officerRishi Kumar Shukla's appointment to the top post citing the officer's lack of experience in anti-corruption investigations.MrKharge even sent a two-page dissent noteto the Prime Minister to register his resistance.A day after Union minister Arun Jaitley, who is in the US on a medical trip, dissected what he described as ""the Kharge dissent"" in a blog post. The minister ripped through the Congress leader for dissenting too often.""Shri Kharge dissents regularly. He dissented when Shri Alok Verma was appointed, dissented when Shri Alok Verma was transferred and has now dissented when Shri RK Shukla has been appointed,"" Mr Jaitley wrote.In 2017, Mr Kharge, who was part of the three-member selection committee apart from the Prime Minister and Chief Justice, had written a three-page-long note to the government, marking his dissent to Alok Verma's appointment. The Congress leader had said that Mr Verma had no experience in anti-corruption operations and the government had overlooked the senior-most and a more competent officer Rupak Kumar Dutta.Dissents are a powerful instrument in democracy as the dissenter offers an alternative view point, Mr Jaitley pointed out and agreed to Mr Kharge's right to dissent. However, the right to dissent is sacrosanct and has to be sparingly used, he added.""A dissent should never be a political tool,"" Mr Jaitley warned.The union minister said that Mr Kharge has been dissenting on ""every conceivable opportunity"" and it has established a pattern of his frame of mind. ""He uses the weapon of dissent excessively and not objectively. Using the instrument of dissent recklessly neutralizes its value,"" Mr Jaitley emphasised.Mallikarjun Kharge was also accused of being prejudiced and making the whole selection process (of the CBI chief) look like a ""political battle"" in Arun Jaitley's 950-odd words Facebook post.The minister also questioned why the Congress leader continued to be part of the committee that transferred Alok Verma when he was in support of the CBI officer.""Mr Kharge's dissent in the matter of the transfer of Alok Verma was coloured by his political views. He was a petitioner in the Supreme Court himself in support of Alok Verma. He should have recused himself from the Committee since his views were known. He suffered from a bias and conflict of interest. Yet he did not recuse himself. The only task before the Committee was whether the CVC report contains the adequate material for transfer of the Director or not. He wanted the Committee to either ignore the CVC report or sit in appeal against the finding of the CVC - something which was beyond the jurisdiction of the Committee,"" the post explained.Former CBI chief Alok Verma, who was engaged in a bitter fight with his deputy Rakesh Asthana over corruption allegations, was in January removed as boss of the high-profile investigating agency by a panel led by PM Modi, just two days after the Supreme Court had reinstated him in the post. He was transferred to the Fire Services as Director General, after the panel said that as CBI chief, he had ""not acted with the integrity expected of him"".Mr Kharge had put up a dissent note saying that the Central Vigilance Commission inquiry had not found evidence that Mr Verma was guilty of bribery.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

The 82-year-old made the announcement in Imphal. The filmmaker has made 14 feature and 31 non-feature films.Protests have rocked the entire northeast against the proposal to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from neighbouring Muslim-majority countries.Critics have called the proposal blatantly anti-Muslim and an attempt by the BJP to boost its Hindu voter base ahead of a general election due by May.Last month, in a major embarrassment for the BJP-led government in Assam, family members of the people who lost their lives during the anti-illegal immigrant movement in the eighties - who were given an award by the Sarbananda Sonowal government in 2016 - decided to return the awards.125 such families took out a rally in Guwahati to return the awards as a mark of their protest against the bill, which the victim families see as an insult to the memories of the 855 people who lost their lives during the Assam agitation.The bill, which seeks to give citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, has been passed by the Lok Sabha.The bill will be tabled for approval in the Rajya Sabha in the next session, where it is expected to face resistance from the opposition Congress party. The BJP does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha.While people have hit the streets to protest against facilitating the entry of outsiders, social groups allege discrimination against immigrants on religious grounds.At least four chief ministers from the Northeast have raised their concerns on the bill until now. Recently, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma and Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga visited the national capital in a combined effort to make the centre scrap the controversial legislation in the face of raging protests across the region.Meanwhile, the joint platform protesting the Citizenship Bill in Manipur - the Manipur People Against Citizenship Amendment Bill (MPACAB) -- has called for a total boycott of use of Hindi language, ban on playing the National Anthem and visits of the Prime Minister and the Home minister until the Bill is withdrawn.

Over 1,500 farmers from Uttar Pradesh staged a protest near the Delhi-Noida flyway on Saturday, demanding an increased compensation for land acquired before 2013. The crucial route connecting UP and Delhi was briefly shut on Friday evening.The rally organised by Kisan Uday Abhiyan, included farmers from Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Aligarh and Meerut.""We are here to demand compensation in accordance with the law on land acquisition that was passed in Parliament in 2013. Our lands were acquired prior to that and we have been left out from the benefits given out under the new law,"" Kaale Singh, a farmer told news agency PTI. He said the farmers want local authorities and administration to take up the matter with UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.""Yesterday we tried to go to Delhi but were stopped midway, so we decided to stay put near the DND. We won't budge unless we get a satisfactory response from top officials,"" he said.Gautam Buddh Nagar District Magistrate BN Singh met the farmers on Saturday and assured them that he would discuss the matter with the state government.In 2011, two policemen and farmers were killed in clashes following protests over acquisition of land in Greater Noida's Bhatta Parsaul, a Jat-dominated village.Two years since that upheaval the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (also Land Acquisition Act, 2013) was passed.The new law was aimed at providing ""fair compensation"" to those whose land is taken away, brings transparency to the process of acquisition of land to set up factories or buildings, infrastructure projects and assures rehabilitation of those affected.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Former Madhya Pradesh Police Chief Rishi Kumar Shukla Is New CBI Boss,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ips-rishi-kumar-shukla-appointed-new-cbi-director-1987358,"Rishi Kumar Shukla, the new CBI chief, will head the CBI for a period of two years.The 58-year-old officer from Gwalior is at present the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation.",,"Former Madhya Pradesh Director General of Police Rishi Kumar Shukla, a 1983-batch officer, has been appointed the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, said a government notification. His name was chosen from a shortlist of over 30 contenders for the top post by a committee led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Mr Shukla will head the CBI for a period of two years, the notification added.The 58-year-old officer from Gwalior is at present the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation. Although Mr Shukla has never been part of the CBI, he had served in the Intelligence Bureau where he handled several sensitive cases. He is said to be close to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.His appointment was made a day after the second meeting of a high-powered committee comprising PM Modi, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and opposition leader Mallikarjun Kharge.But it took several calls and a lot of convincing from the Prime Minister along with the Chief Justice for protesting Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge to agree toRK Shukla's name, sources said.Mr Kharge in his two-page dissent note to PM Modihad expressed his objection citing the officer's lack of experience in anti-corruption investigations. He said all three aspects -- seniority, integrity and investigative experience in investigation of anti-corruption cases -- should be given equal weightage.""Seniority cannot be only criterion in appointment to such a critical post and experience in anti-corruption cases and prior experience of having served in the organisation should also be considered,"" the note said.His objection was, however, rejected because they felt he was the senior-most officer with highest grading, sources added.Sources also told NDTV that last year, RK Shukla's name was also shortlisted for the post of the Director of the Intelligence Bureau (DIB). But 1980-batch IPS officer Rajiv Jain, the present DIB, got an extention till June 2019.Mr Shukla had played a key role in the extradition of underworld don Abu Salem -- who was found guilty in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts which killed over 250 people -- and his then-girlfriend Monica Bedi in 2005, the source said.The post of the CBI chief had been vacant since theunceremonious exit of Alok Verma, who had been engaged in a bitter fight with his deputy and Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana over corruption allegations.Rishi Kumar Shukla is at present the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation.The tension between the two officers peaked after Mr Verma's team filed a police case against Mr Asthana, accusing him of accepting bribes from a businessman being investigated by the agency in a money laundering case. Both were sent on forced leave in October following the centre's intervention.Alok Verma was replaced by M Nageswara Rao, but a non-profit challenged his appointment as the acting CBI chief.On January 10, Alok Verma was removed as boss of the high-profile investigating agency by a panel led by PM Modi, just two days after the Supreme Court had reinstated him in the post. He was transferred to the Fire Services as Director General, after the panel said that as CBI chief, he had ""not acted with the integrity expected of him"". Congress's Mallikarjun Kharge, representing the opposition, put up a dissenting note saying that the vigilance inquiry had not found evidence that Mr Verma was guilty of bribery.The sacked officer refused to take charge as chief of fire services and quit. However, the Home Ministry has decided to conduct disciplinary proceedings against him for failing to take up the new job.On Friday,the Supreme Court had pulled up the centrefor the delay in appointing the CBI chief and said it was ""averse"" to the arrangement of an interim CBI director. However, three top court judges recused themselves from the case for various reasons.The post of CBI director is ""sensitive"" and ""important"", and it is not good to keep an interim director of the agency for longer period, the top court had observed.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

The CBI wanted to quiz him over two Ponzi schemes, over which several leaders of the Ms Banerjee's party have been arrested.Rajeev Kumar -- who headed a Special Investigation Team probing the Saradha and Rose Valley Ponzi scams that surfaced in 2013 -- was asked to help with the investigation after several key documents allegedly went missing.

""How dare you come to a police commissioner's home without a warrant,"" she said.""There is total constitutional breakdown.

However, after the talks with the Congress went south, the BJP had mocked the proposed alliance, saying it had no central figure as its leader.Mamata Banerjee last month organised a rally for the leaders of opposition parties.

The region has been witnessing wide scale protests ever since the controversial Bill was introduced in Parliament earlier this month and passed by the Lok Sabha.In BJP-ruled Assam, protests have been taking place for the fifth week with the opposition Congress also taking out rallies across the state vehemently opposing the Bill.The agitation on the issue in Assam - a region where it has done phenomenally well since 2014 - has put the party on the back foot. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal recently told the assembly that the provisions of the Assam Accord will not be violated by the Citizenship bill.""The Citizenship Bill is for entire nation, not only Assam... Then why unnecessary fear is being created among people? From where has this figure of 1.9 crore Hindu Bangladeshis coming to Assam emerged?,"" he told the Assembly.""We should not confuse people by saying that Assamese identity and culture will be finished. The opposition should behave responsibly,"" he added.On Friday, Mr Sonowal claimed ""unnecessary social disturbance"" was being created over the bill ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.In a grand show of strength, 10 political parties based in the northeastern region, including BJP allies and the JD(U) came together on Tuesday to oppose the citizenship amendment bill and ensure that it is not passed in the Rajya Sabha. Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga, who was also present at the meeting, said that the bill which was ""dangerous and harmful for the people of the northeast.""A BJP leader was recently beaten up by those protesting against the citizenship amendment bill in Assam's Tinsukia district.In his address to parliament, the President also spoke on the bill. ""Citizenship Amendment Bill will make it easier to provide Indian citizenship to those who had to take refuge in India after facing oppression somewhere else. They were not at fault; they were victims of situations like that"" President Ram Nath Kovind told the parliament.But the President's address has failed to calm nerves.The BJP's popularity has alsotaken a hit in Tripura, where it came to power with the support of its tribal ally nearly a year back, creating electoral history. Now, the tribals in the state are cutting across political lines to protest against the controversial bill.""We have all gathered non politically and send a message to (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi that first they should think of people of northeast, then migrant. It's not about politics but about our existence"" said Pradyot Manikya Debburman, Tripura 's Royal Scion and Working President of Congress in Tripura.Two BJP legislators in Meghalaya havethreatened to quit the partyif the bill is tabled in the Rajya Sabha. A delegation from the state headed by Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma is already in New Delhi meeting key NDA allies urging them not to vote in favour of the bill in Rajya Sabha.For the BJP, the 25 Lok Sabha seat in the northeast is very important. In 2014, it won eight seats on it own, while its allies won four. Rest of the 13 seats were won by non-NDA parties.Ever since the BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014, its average vote share in the northeast has grown 23.1 percentage points from 3.9% to 27%. Out of the 38.18 percent votes that the NDA got in Northeast in 2014, regional parties had got over 24 percent f those vote.In the 2014 general election BJP and its regional partners together got 38.18 percent of vote share, non NDA parties got 61.82 in the 25 seats in Northeast.Since 2014 BJP's vote share has increased to 27 percent in the region, while its allies vote share is 24.61 per cent.The Citizenship Amendment Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, but it has not been listed by the government in the Rajya Sabha where it is short on numbers.

And it is prepared to meet any eventuality arising out of the bill's introduction in the Rajya Sabha.""The government understands that people have the democratic right to protest in order to convey their ideas, but certain actions -- such as stripping -- should not be done in a mature society. They should not resort to violence either,"" said Assam Chief Secretary Alok Kumar.He was referring to a recent incident where three menstaged a nude protestagainst the controversial legislation outside the Assam Secretariat in Dispur. While one of them was completely naked, the others had stripped down to their undergarments. They were immediately taken into police custody.Mr Kumar held that it was important to keep the peace, especially with the general elections just a few months away.

Indian Girl Students Fight To Stay Out After Dark: Foreign Media,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-girl-students-fight-to-stay-out-after-dark-foreign-media-1987029,"Women's access to education in India has improved vastly in the past three decades, but social change has been slower.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-02/8nf3dq8g_du-hostel-protest-650_625x300_01_February_19.jpg,"Late one night in the fall, about 200 female students in Bhopal, a city in central India, held a rare demonstration on their college's basketball court. Their very presence there was an act of protest: Women were not allowed to be outside their dormitories after dark, just one of many restrictions on their movement.They spent the night outdoors - the first time many of them had seen the moon since they began college, one student recalled.For years, college campuses in India have regulated the movement of their female students in the name of safety. But in protests over the past several months, women on college campuses nationwide have voiced their demands: freedom from oppressive rules and equality with the male students. And slowly, colleges are responding.Protest by ""Pinjra Tod""or Break the Cage at Delhi University against hostel curfew.Women's access to education in India has improved vastly in the past three decades, but social change has been slower. Reported crime against women has doubled in the past 10 years, which experts say is a result of deeply embedded patriarchal attitudes that are also evidenced by the persistent preference for male children and the decline in the number of working women.The recent protests were inspired by a Delhi-based women's collective, Pinjra Tod, or ""Break the Cage,"" which campaigns against arbitrary curfews and rules imposed on female residents at colleges and universities - part of a broader battle by women's rights activists to take back public spaces and challenge the threat of sexual violence.They're fighting not just the curfew but also ""the idea of policing women and how they are kept in gendered spaces,"" said Joan Sony Cherian, a member of the collective.Women in India this month have entered a temple that once banned female visitors of menstruating age and prompted the dismissal of a professor for comparing virgins to ""a sealed bottle."" Last year, dozens of women shared stories of sexual harassment at workplaces as part of a burgeoning #MeToo movement.Women carried out months of protest against the hostel curfew in Delhi University.At Bhopal's Regional Institute of Education, which trains students to become teachers, the campus residences had strict rules for women. Female students had to be back in their dorm rooms by 5:30 p.m. in the winter, by 6:45 p.m. at other times. Leaving campus was allowed only between 1 to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. Food delivery was allowed only until 5:30 p.m.If a woman wanted to leave campus for a longer period, her parents were required to fax the request, after which two sets of administrative signatures were required. Female students did not have access to the rooftop terrace. For the men on campus, most of these rules did not apply.The women began their campaign with a sit-in, borrowing tactics and strategies developed by Break the Cage. Without their support, ""our protest would not have been at this scale,"" said Rai, a participating student, who spoke on the condition of partial anonymity to avoid possible retaliation by the college.On the third day of the protest, the administration relented. Now women don't have to return to campus until 8 p.m. and can remain outside their dorm rooms while on campus until 9 p.m. Later that week, a group of female students danced in a religious procession on campus in celebration. It was a new taste of freedom: Under the previous rules, they were locked in during festivals or could celebrate only in an enclosed space demarcated for them.The protests weren't limited to Bhopal. They spread. In some instances, they were inspired by previous protests; others happened spontaneously.Protest outside colleges after new hostel rules for Delhi University was announced.Female students at a branch of the Regional Institute of Education in Ajmer, a town in Rajasthan state, broke their curfew barely a week after the Bhopal protests. In October, students from Panjab University protested for 48 days. Protests led by Break the Cage at prestigious Delhi colleges such as Miranda House and Lady Shri Ram College soon followed.Administrators at the government-run Regional Institute of Education declined to comment on the protests. Lady Shri Ram College, a branch of Delhi University, said that the college had introduced changes such as ending the requirement for female students to have local guardians. The new rules were announced just before the planned protest.Pratibha Jolly, Miranda House principal, acknowledged that the old rules were ""archaic and major reform was overdue."" After last year's protest, the college made the curfew later and increased the number of nights a resident could stay out of the dorm.""Our biggest challenge is to provide a safe, secure environment while nurturing liberal and progressive education for an extremely diverse student population,"" Jolly said. ""This requires nuanced responses.""But members of Break the Cage reject the safety argument. Devika Shekhawat, a member of the group, said women are aware of the risks. ""We want to change the spaces"" rather than force women to change their behavior, she said.Protesters hold up posters that show a bird flying out of a cage in Delhi University.Break the Cage has been advocating for women on campuses since 2015. While curfews have been central to its demands, it has also drawn attention to issues such as higher fees charged by dormitories for women, the lack of sexual harassment committees mandated by law, and moral policing of female students.The solidarity offered by Break the Cage has made a difference, said Kanupriya, 23, the student union president of Panjab University, who goes by one name. She led a successful campaign to scrap the dorm curfew.These successes alone will not bring about gender equality, Kanupriya said, but they are a way to move the needle: ""This is about changing what is considered normal.""Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.

Two of the 11 people began their hunger strike on Wednesday, officials added.""The ICE Health Services Corps is medically monitoring the detainees'' health and regularly updating ICE of their medical status,"" the agency''s statement said.""Efforts are being taken to protect the detainees'' health and privacy"".Ruby Kaur, a lawyer for two of the detainees in Texas says her clients, like the majority of those taking part in the hunger strike there, are Indian immigrants who entered the US through southern border more than six months ago and turned themselves in to officials.""They have tubes that have been shoved through their noses and IV''s giving them fluids. It''s extremely painful and it''s against their will,"" Ms Kaur told NPR, adding that as recently as Thursday morning her clients told her in a phone conversation that they are experiencing nasal and rectal bleeding and vomiting.They began the hunger strike at the start of the new year to call attention to what they say are inhumane conditions, repeated verbal threats of deportation and debilitating angst created by a total absence of information about their impending asylum cases.Ms Kaur said that up until 10 days ago - about the time a federal judge ordered the nasogastric intubation - both of her clients and several others, were held in solitary confinement for two weeks ""to intimidate them"" into ending the protest.""They want to get out and be with their families. They want move forward with their legal cases,"" Ms Kaur said, adding that each of her clients have extended family living in the US.Christina Fialho, the co-executive director of the nonprofit Freedom for Immigrants, said as many as 30 people could be on hunger strike in El Paso, a higher figure than the one ICE provided.The use of force-feeding, she said, represented an escalation in the tactics used by immigration officials on detainees.""It''s barbaric,"" she added.An ICE spokeswoman did not comment directly on the allegations leveled by Ms Kaur and Fialho.But the agency said that it does not retaliate in any way against hunger strikers and that it tells detainees about the negative health effects of not eating, The New York Times reported.Th Indian-American community in the US has expressed concern over reports that that federal immigration officials are force-feeding Indian detainees.North American Punjabi Association (NAPA) in a statement said 11 Indian detainees at the El Paso Processing Center in Texas have been refusing food. ""Force-feeding to any immigrant is a violation of human rights,"" said NAPA executive director Satnam Singh Chahal.Some of the detainees have been on fast for more than 30 days, he said. ""They are now so weak that they cannot stand up or talk. This is learnt that they stopped eating to protest verbal abuse and threats of deportation from guards. They are also upset about lengthy lock ups while awaiting legal proceedings,"" he said.Instead of the authorities not addressing the detainees'' allegations of abuse, Chahal alleged that El Paso Processing Centre is not following the federal standards for care.""The men with nasal tubes are having persistent nose bleeds, and are vomiting several times a day. They are not well. Their bodies are really weak, they can''t talk and they have been hospitalized, back and forth, they want to know why they are still in the jail and want to get their rights and wake up the government immigration system,"" he said.In a separate statement, South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) said that it is deeply disturbed by reports of staff at the El Paso, Texas detention processing centre force-feeding mostly Indian and Cuban detainees in the midst of a hunger strike.Up to 30 detainees, the majority of whom have pending asylum claims, went on a hunger strike after verbal and psychological abuse at the hands of ICE and detention centre staff at the notorious El Paso facility, SAALT said.""Individuals should not have to put their bodies and lives on the line to draw attention to their indefinite detention. Our nation''s immigration system should provide protection from violence and persecution, yet current practices create an increasingly punitive asylum process, which only extends the violence and persecution asylum seekers are fleeing,"" Suman Raghunathan, SAALT executive director, said.Get the latestelection news, live updates andelection scheduleforLok Sabha Elections 2019on ndtv.com/elections.
