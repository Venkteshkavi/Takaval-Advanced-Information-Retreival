"Sitaram Yechury, Subramanian Swamy cross swords after Left leader says Hindu epics replete with violence","Sitaram Yechury, Subramanian Swamy cross swords after Left leader says Hindu epics replete with violence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sitaram-yechury-subramanian-swamy-cross-swords-after-left-leader-says-hindu-epics-replete-with-violence/articleshow/69169542.cms,en,"NEW DELHI: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury kicked up a storm on Friday with his editorial in party mouthpiece People’s Democracy where he said Ramayana and Mahabharata were “filled with instances of violence”, a reference he made in order to discredit PM Modi’s statement that “Hindus can never be violent.” “In his urge to retain his Prime Ministership, he erases Indian history replete with gruesome battles and wars. Strange for an RSS pracharak, who preaches that our epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata replete with conflicts and violent wars is the only source of our history,” Yechury said describing Modi’s remark as “amazing”. Yechury’s comments drew a sharp rebuttal from BJP leader Subramanian Swamy who said the CPM chief’s remarks were laughable because he represented a party that believed in “revolutionary violence” and was now espousing non-violence. Swamy also said Hindus don’t believe in violence, but cited instances from both Mahabharata and Ramayana to assert Hindus don’t step back from “retaliatory violence” when provoked. “We demand an apology from him by trying to defame the Hindu religion and spreading lies and hate against Hindu epics and scriptures that have promoted noble values like victory of good over the evil, universal brotherhood and non-violence,” BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao said in a statement. Calling Modi’s comments as “venomous communal polarisation”, Yechury said Ashoka, the king of the Mauryan empire embraced Buddhism after being remorseful for his bloody conquest of Kalinga. “It is only after denouncing Hinduism and adopting Buddhism that Ashoka found his reverence for life through tolerance, compassion and peaceful co-existence,” Yechury said. “In fact, his symbol Chakra today occupies a place of pride on our tri-colour National Flag. It was his four lion stupa that is India’s official symbol. The RSS/BJP behavior today is the complete opposite of what is inscribed on stupas,” he added. Swamy, however, dismissed Yechury’s allegations as ridiculous and said the opposition was floundering because BJP’s “Hindutva” was upsetting all their calculations and even took a dig at Sitaram Yechury’s first name. In the editorial, Yechury attacked RSS ideologue Vinayak Savarkar because he tried to “Hinduize the military and militarise the Hindus’ and targeted Pragya Thakur, BJP’s Bhopal nominee, for disrespecting martyred police officer Hemant Karkare and alleged that after the initial phases of elections, BJP has resorted to the “core Hindutva agenda” of abolition of Articles 35A and section 370, construction of Ram Mandir on the disputed site, Uniform Civil Code and National Register of Citizens.

"Supreme Court acquits 7 men convicted of arson, violence in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case","Supreme Court acquits 7 men convicted of arson, violence in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sc-acquits-7-men-convicted-of-arson-violence-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots-case/articleshow/69121353.cms,en,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 35 years after their alleged involvement in violence and arson during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the Supreme Court on Tuesday reversed concurrent judgments of the trial court and Delhi high court and acquitted seven persons who were sentenced to five years in jail. Appearing for the convicts, senior advocate R Basant and advocate V Raghunath told a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna that they were picked up randomly by police for violating curfew imposed after the rioting and that there was no evidence to link them to rioting or arson. The trial court in 1996 had convicted 88 people on these charges and the Delhi HC had in November last year upheld their conviction and sentence while asking them to surrender and undergo rigorous imprisonment. The SC on Tuesday took up appeals of seven of the 88 convicts. Referring to the prosecution evidence, the CJI-led bench said it unhesitatingly took the view that the prosecution witnesses have neither identified the accused nor placed any evidence against them before the court. “It is a classic case of no evidence against the accused,” the bench said and ordered their acquittal from the case. Appearing for the prosecution, additional solicitor general Pinky Anand suggested that in a case involving many accused, the prosecution should be permitted to apply ‘mechanical test’ to produce evidence against key persons to rope in others who were accompanying them. But, the SC said it did not see how the mechanical test would help the prosecution when it was a case of ‘no evidence at all’. “The offence alleged against the accused is rioting. But without any evidence and their identification by the witnesses, they cannot be convicted,” it said. ",01 May 2019,2019-05-01 00:06:14

An FIR was lodged against Babul Supriyo , Union minister and BJP candidate for Asansol, following a directive by the Election Commission over entering a polling station at Barabani. The state's Chief Electoral Officer Ariz Aftab, however, claimed that barring ""sporadic incidents"", the polling was, by an large, ""peaceful"". ""Other than some sporadic incidents, elections today were by and large peaceful. Immediate necessary action was initiated at places from where we got complaints,"" Aftab told reporters. He said the polling percentage would go up as many voters were still standing in queue to exercise their franchise. State's Additional Director General of police (Law and order) Siddhi Nath Gupta said, six FIRs were lodged during the day over incidents of violence and 145 people arrested. Gupta said five people were injured in clashes between workers of rival political parties. All of them were undergoing treatment. Trinamool Congress and BJP workers and supporters, including women, were seen clashing using bamboo sticks. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged central forces opened fire inside a polling booth in Birbhum. She claimed the BJP had ""misused"" the central forces to rig the elections. The EC show-caused the Birbhum BJP candidate Dudh Kumar Mondal after he was seen talking over a mobile phone inside a polling booth just before casting his vote. According to reports, Supriyo had an argument with polling officials inside a polling station in Asansol following which TMC workers attacked his vehicle parked outside. Though the rear windshield of his vehicle was smashed the singer-politician was unharmed. Supriyo said, ""I visited Barabani to witness the polling but found that voters were not being allowed to exercise their franchise. Our fight is to establish democracy ... It is shameful that I have to say this in a democratic country."" Asked to comment on the incident, TMC's Asansol candidate, actor-turned politician Moon Moon Sen, said she had no knowledge of the clashes as she woke up late. ""They provided me my bed tea very late so I woke up quite late. What can I say? I really don't know,"" Sen told a national TV news channel. She declined to comment when asked about the allegations made by Supriyo. ""I don't want to hear his name. Bas (that's it)"". An EC official said that voters fled a polling station at Jemua in Bardhhaman-Durgapur constituency, where BJP leader S S Ahluwalia is in the fray, after being threatened by miscreants. There were clashes between supporters of rival TMC and BJP at Nanoor, Rampurhat, Nalhati and Suri areas of Birbhum constituency in which several people were injured. In Dubrajpur area of the constituency, security personnel fired in the air to control a mob which allegedly scuffled with personnel of the central forces when they were barred from entering the booths with mobile phones. Following this, polling was stalled in these booths, the official said. A combative Banerjee, who is among the most strident critics of the BJP, accused it of using central forces for garnering votes. She said she had heard that CRPF personnel fired inside a polling booth at Dubrajpur. ""I am yet to the detailed report .... law and order is a state subject and it is not the job of the central forces to enter any polling booth as they are deployed to keep vigil outside it. They do not have the right to lathicharge or fire,"" the TMC supremo said. ""We know the law .... law and order is a state subject and not a central subject. I have heard that complaints were made (before the EC) that the central forces personnel have gone inside booths and asked people to vote for the BJP. This will not help the BJP,"" she told a rally at Bagda in North 24 Parganas district. Banerjee said that central forces, even if they have to conduct a route march, are required to do it along with the state police. ""But the BJP does not trust the Bengal police. The (West Bengal) police is on security duty during Durga Puja and Diwali. However, during elections you need policemen from Delhi"". The poll body had put TMC Birbhum president Anubrata Mondal, known for his controversial remarks, under scanner after poll workers complained that they feel ""threatened"" by his presence. At Hanskhali in Ranaghat constituency, a woman voter was critically injured in a bomb explosion outside a polling station during a clash between workers of rival parties, Nadia district election officer Sumit Gupta said. Accusing the TMC of rigging the polls in almost every booth, BJP's Krishnanagar candidate Kalyan Chaubey said voters in several areas were not allowed to cast their ballots. ""The TMC goons jammed booths at Chapra, Dompukur and Hatisala areas of Krishnagar constituency. The central forces guarded the booths but people beyond the mandatory 100-metre radius were warned against casting their votes. I was also threatened by some of them,"" he claimed. Rejecting the charges, TMC Krishnagar candidate Mahua Maitra said the accusations were baseless. ""They (the BJP) do not have a support base in the constituency so they could not appoint enough observers for the polling stations. Now, they are giving excuses. The allegations are baseless,"" she added. The constituencies that went to poll on Monday are- Baharampur, Krishnanagar, Ranaghat (SC), Burdwan East (SC), Burdwan-Durgapur, Asansol, Bolpur (SC) and Birbhum. ",29 Apr 2019,2019-04-29 16:34:12
Spreading the message of non-violence through toys,Spreading the message of non-violence through toys,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/spreading-the-message-of-non-violence-through-toys/articleshow/69110278.cms,en,"What do you do when your child asks for a toy? You buy it, right? Sudib Ahimsa does the opposite. He collects waste materials and creates a brand new toy. An advocate of sustainable living , 41-year-old Sudib has been teaching the concept of Ahimsa toys to children around the country for almost a decade. As part of his mission, he recently conducted his maiden workshop in Coimbatore. “It was great working with the children here and I got a good response. In fact, the mother of one of the participants, greeted me with a customary welcome gift of Tamil Nadu,” says the IIT alumnus. From being directionless in life at one point of time to a person who is making a huge difference in the lives of people, Subid has come a long way. “I did many odd jobs and worked at different places. But, it was my meeting with innovator and toy maker Arvind Gupta from Pune that changed my life forever. He creates toys out of waste material. I worked with him for a while and was quite inspired by him. My work is of a similar kind, albeit with my own touch. The concept of Ahimsa toys is to spread non-violence and love, and at the same time, sustainable living. Be it a straw, old calendar, books or even discarded object, all these are converted into a toy. Toys are a great medium to spread the message of waste management, self-reliance and sustainability.” Though Sudib conducts workshops in toy making, he says that children do not really need toys. “For children, even their parents are toys. They can play with anything and anyone. So, why bombard them with so many materials in the form of toys and create waste? Even if you make toys from trash, they will be happy. They also understand everything better. My workshops focus on children as I find them more knowledgeable than adults. For, instance, take their primary quality of innocence. They learn better because of their clear mind. Children do not know about caste, colour or other prejudices like us. We bring them down by teaching all that. There should be no boundaries or barriers for children to learn. At the same time, they are also great teachers. I have picked up many techniques from them.” Subid also employs a different method of teaching. “I allow children to learn themselves and in teams. Normal teaching kills the very ability to learn on your own, thus destroying self-confidence. We need to alter the education system for better learning and freedom.” Subid is a strong critic of industrialization and development. “Mainstream development teaches us to compete with others and kill, thus propagating violence. If you look at human history, there is a lot of violence. Right from a mosquito to a person in an enemy nation, we have killed them. Today, violence has become a normal thing. Is that the solution to a problem? Development also creates a lot of waste. For instance, when you buy a mosquito coil or a machine, you generate waste and add to the pollution. We have abused the environment and resources so much so that it’s high time we embraced a different kind of lifestyle. Mainstream development spreads hatred. On the other hand, I spread love and convert waste to wealth. I believe that the most wasted things on the planet are our brain and time. We need to put them to good use. Ahimsa toys is a step toward that.” ",30 Apr 2019,2019-04-30 07:52:30

The deceased were identified by police as Dani Batra, a protester, and Sujeet Kumar Minz, a jawan of Odisha Industrial Security Force (OISF). OISF is a state security force that is under police command. The incident comes less than a year after police opened fire on demonstrators protesting against the operation of another Vedanta plant, its copper smelter in Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu, killing 13 people. A group of around 70 local people, who are likely to be displaced due to the commissioning of a proposed project by the company, were on a dharna outside the firm’s main gate in Lanjigarh, demanding contractual jobs and education for their children in a public school free of cost. The agitators alleged that the district police along with the OISF personnel used force and resorted to lathicharge to stifle their voice and threaten them to withdraw the protest. “We were on a peaceful dharna. But police forcibly tried to evict us from the spot. When we resisted, they resorted to lathicharge. This left one Dani Batra dead and several injured,” a protester from a nearby village, who refused to be named fearing police backlash, said. Maheswar Pati, another villager, said the violence broke out after some police personnel misbehaved with the agitators.

The mob went on the rampage, vandalized the company premises and attacked our staff. The protesters even set several articles on the company campus on fire.

Hearing a suo motu writ petition on the violence, a division bench headed by Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan observed that unauthorised intrusion into court premises and the activities would stand to breach the Constitution and the laws. Lawyers at the Howrah district court and employees of the Howrah Municipal Corporation , which is located opposite to the court, clashed on April 24 over vehicle parking. The lawyers alleged police highhandedness in controlling the situation. Several persons, including lawyers, were injured in the incident. The bench said the executive agency of a state has the constitutional duty to provide infrastructure for courts and protect those institutions and premises dedicated for activities in connection with the courts. The bench, also comprising Justice Arijit Banerjee, said the courts are constitutional forts of power and authority from where judicial power is exercised on behalf of the sovereign.

No Domestic Violence Act relief to wife if divorce already granted: HC,No Domestic Violence Act relief to wife if divorce already granted: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/no-dv-act-relief-to-wife-if-divorce-already-granted-hc/articleshow/69120613.cms,en,"NAGPUR: In an important verdict, the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay high court ruled that divorcee can’t seek maintenance from her ex-husband under the ‘Protection of Women From Domestic Violence (DV) Act, 2005’. The city-based woman was earlier granted divorce by the Nagpur family court on June 30, 2008. A year later, she moved Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) by filing an application under Sections 12 and 18 of the DV Act, alleging violence by her former husband. After it was rejected on August 20, 2015, she moved to sessions’ court, which too, rejected her plea on August 8, 2017. Subsequently, she filed a revision in the HC for relief under DV Act. “In the present case, divorce was granted by the family Court in 2008 and application under DV Act was filed in 2009. At the time, the applicant was not the wife. There was no domestic relationship between them. Hence, orders passed by the JMFC and maintained by additional sessions’ judge, are perfectly legal and correct,” a single-judge bench comprising justice Murlidhar Giratkar held, adding that there is no perversity or illegality in both orders. The petitioner entered into a wedlock in July 1999 and had two children from the marriage. After differences cropped up between them, they separated for a while. Subsequently, the husband had filed for restitution of conjugal rights, but later on resolved their issues and started living together again on a trial basis. When they realize that they can’t live together, husband filed for separation which was granted by the family court. Petitioner’s counsel Amruta Ghonge contended that despite there is no subsisting domestic relation between husband and wife, the woman is still entitled to get relief under the DV Act. She relied on a few Supreme Court cases to press her arguments. Opposing her contentions, husband’s counsel RN Sen argued that since petitioner filed the case after the divorce was granted, there is no subsisting domestic relation between husband and wife. Hence, she can’t claim the same under the DV Act and her application is not maintainable. He supplemented his arguments with a couple of cases of the Supreme Court and other high courts which laid down that in the absence of a domestic relation at the time of filing petition, the proceedings under the DV Act will not be maintainable. While observing that there’s no merit in the petition, the judge held that if there is no persisting domestic relation and divorce is already granted before filing the petition under DV Act, then no relief can be availed by the ex-wife.

Sources said that the senior officials came to the conclusion that law and order situation turned grim in Gurazala constituency particularly due to the way it was handled by two circle inspectors. Senior officials have already gathered some evidence about the circle inspectors of Gurazala and Piduguralla towns accused of working like the activists of a political party on the polling day in spite of clear instructions not to take sides. The situation in Gurazala constituency remained tense even three days after the polling due to the over-enthusiasm of certain police officials, locals said. Local Muslim leaders alleged that police inspectors targeted the minority community in Piduguralla town following the instructions of TDP leaders. Local TDP activists had attacked some Muslim youths in Mayabazar area on Friday. Surprisingly, police canned the Muslims when they went to the police station to lodge a complaint. The TDP activists along with the police reached the Muslim residential colony and knocked every door late in the evening to threaten them. Police reported to have used abusive language against the locals for backing YSRCP . A local inspector believed to have dragged and thrashed a woman for trying to lodge a complaint against the police. This incident created panic in the area as the locals staged dharna demanding action against the police. Police had resorted to the lathicharge Muslims community members in Gurazala even on the polling day in bid to reduce the polling percentage as the TDP local leadership suspected that local Muslims were backing YSRCP. “Brazen support of police to the TDP is only creating troubles in the constituency. We have already requested the senior officials to probe the role of of inspectors Ramarao and Veerendra,” said YSRCP leader Kasu Mahesh Reddy. He warned that the police officials who have deliberately acted like TDP agents would surely face the music once YS Jagan took over the reins of the state after the declaration of poll results. Srinivasa Reddy, whose movie theatre was ransacked by TDP activists, said that CI Ramarao threatened him to kill in an encounter if he approached the senior officials with a complaint against him. Local DSP Srihari Rao said that they would look into all the issues related to the high-handedness of police officials and submit a report to the IG and SP of the district.

Bulandshahr SP City Atul Kumar Srivastava said: ""Agarwal was arrested by Bulandshahr police from Hapur in the early hours of Thursday."" He was last of the prime accused in violence in Syana area of Bulandshahr and was allegedly involved in instigating the crowd that went on the rampage, killing the inspector and the youth. The crowd also set on fire Chingrawati police post and a number of vehicles parked there, including a police vehicle carrying the injured police officer, who died in absence of immediate medical assistance. It took police more than a month to nab Agarwal even though the latter had been uploading his videos on social media, claiming innocence in addition to giving interviews to TV channels. ""In all, 36 accused have been arrested now, including the key ones like Bajrang Dal leader Yogesh Raj, Prashant Natt, who allegedly shot dead the cop and Kalua, who had attacked the police officer with an axe. This is besides seven arrested in the cow slaughter case that led to violence,” said a police officer. Police have also recovered the axe which Kalua used to attack the cops but the Subodh Singh’s pistol which was used to kill him is yet to be recovered. On Wednesday, police got remand of Natt for 12 hours after which Meerut Zone AGD Prashant Kumar had said: “With most of the accused in jail, now police’ priority is to find the weapon used to kill the cop.” On December 3, villagers found carcasses of cows in the agricultural fields of Mahav village in Syana. Soon after, members of some saffron groups joined villagers and carried the carcasses in tractor trolleys to stage protest in front of Chingrawati police post. This led to a clash between agitated crowds and inadequate police force in which the Syana inspector and a youth were killed. Incidentally, the incident took place on the last day of Tabligi Iztema that witnessed a religious convention comprising 1.5 million Muslim devotees. ",11 Jan 2019,2019-01-11 00:00:00

Banerjee clarified at a Siliguri gathering on Saturday that she is not opposed to celebrating Ram Navami, but is against the import of violence into religion. The CM wished the crowd on the occasion of Ashoke Sasthi, Ram Navami and Baisakhi. “Whose head are you going to break with that mace? Whose head are you going to chop off with that sword?” Banerjee said after coming to know that some BJP leaders were carrying arms in Ram Navami processions. The CM was taken aback by the development when the model code of conduct is in force. “I am wearing a Trinamool badge. I don’t go to a mandir or masjid with this badge lest I am accused of trying to influence voters,” she said. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, however, is unfazed. Asked about his waving the mace replica to a crowd in Midnapore, Ghosh said: “I did it to protect women and children of Bengal. Election panels come and go. They are not above Lord Ram.” Banerjee held that such a stance doesn’t go with Bharatiya/Bengali culture. “Religion doesn’t mean violence. But in recent times, a militant religion is being imported. Let BJP go to the people and talk politics. Let PM Modi tell us what his government did for the country in the last five years. Don’t try to put religion on sale for the sake of votes,” the CM said. Banerjee, instead, called upon first-time voters to exercise their franchise for development. “Your first vote should be for development and not for destruction,” she said, listing the projects that her government has undertaken and completed for the development of Siliguri. In the same breath, the CM reminded mothers how PM Modi had led siege to their piggy banks by announcing notebandi. “The Modi government didn’t spare what you call your lakshmir jhapi. Small traders and businessmen were devastated. And then he started dictating to people what to eat, what not and how to dress. Those who fly by Air India must be aware that it has discontinued non-vegetarian food in economy class. Everybody has to eat what Modi eats. Individuals have lost their freedom of choice. Dalits and minorities are the worst victims of the Modi regime,” she said. The CM urged people to vote for Trinamool in this battle against BJP. “I would ask Left supporters why they would vote for the Left. The Left candidate is not going to win anyway. Voting for the Left in such a situation is in a way making BJP strong. I would also ask Congress supporters to ensure BJP’s defeat by voting for Trinamool because we are going to form the government in Delhi along with others,” she said. The Trinamool chief congratulated Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav, who has said that Uttar Pradesh and Bengal will decide the fate of the country. ",14 Apr 2019,2019-04-14 00:00:00

After their marriage, she stayed in Satellite area of the city with her parents and her husband went to Mumbai where he was working at that time. “My father was a heart patient and my mother was visually impaired so I took the responsibility to take care of them.

The complainant’s husband used to taunt her parents for not giving enough dowry to her and even tortured her whenever she raised her voice against his taunts.

In Pune the march started from Shramik bhavan near Pune Municipal Corporation to Balgandharva chowk where women were shouting slogans of freedom so that parties contesting Lok Sabha elections understand the issues and take up the same in their manifestos. Organisers of the March told TOI that the Women March for Change was happening across 20 states in over a 100 places. The march is an open call to women voters to come out and counter the blatant attack on the Idea of India, the already shrinking space of dissent, to save our institutions and our democratic character. With the upcoming elections, the Women for Change campaign plans to reach out to women voters to come out and vote for whoever they feel will do justice to their issues best, stated the members of the campaign. The spirit unity was evident as women from across segments marched hand in hand -- from working class women ,including domestic workers, home-based workers, manual scavengers, to university students and civil society members -- singing in solidarity and sending out a powerful message to the existing government and other political parties contesting the polls. The women alleged that the present schemes announced for the women were a mere eyewash.

Even as Election Commission officials put the provisional voting percentage at 74, chief minister and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu demanded repolling in at least 30% of the booths. He alleged that EVMs had malfunctioned in a large number of constituencies and held YSRCP responsible for widespread violence on polling day. YSRCP chief Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on the other hand directly held Naidu responsible for the violence and even called him a monster. “Naidu is a demon who is responsible for all the violence that took place during the polls,” Jagan said. “He knew he was losing in the elections and tried every means to prevent people from voting.” He also said that the high turnout could mean only one thing: “YSRCP will get a landslide. I won’t say how many seats we will win, but the YSRCP will form the next government.” Setting the tone for opposition leaders for the remaining phases of the general election, Naidu said that the malfunctioning EVMs only strengthened his doubts that the devices could be tampered with. The commission, however, said only 381 EVMs out of 96,000 across the state malfunctioned and the problem was rectified at all places. AP chief electoral officer (CEO) Gopal Krishna Dwivedi denied reports of largescale malfunction of EVMs. Naidu, meanwhile, shot off four letters to the commission and director general of police (DGP) over malfunctioning EVMs and violent incidents at various places in the state. In the letter to Dwivedi, he alleged that nearly 30% EVMs malfunctioned and three hours were wasted at many booths. After casting his vote at Undavalli near Vijayawada, he told reporters that it was time to return to the ballot paper. “In some cases, voters were pressing cycle (TDP’s symbol) button, but the vote was going to fan (YSRCP symbol),” he alleged. In his complaint to the commission Naidu alleged that EVMs did not work till 9.30 am, leaving voters standing in queue for more than two hours at many places. He reiterated his demand for introduction of paper ballots to ensure that there was no “tampering” of the votes polled. Women even protested in Vijayawada after EVMs at polling stations in Moghalrajpuram did not work for a long time. They shouted slogans against the commission. Some voters also complained that they were not able to vote as booth managers did not allow them to take mobile phones into the booth and there was no facility to leave them outside.

Bar council chairman Ashok Deb and members Prasun Datta and Uttam Majumdar also said the council will meet at 4 pm on Monday to review the situation. Howrah Criminal Bar Association secretary Gautam Chatterjee said: “Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel entered the Howrah court premise and beat up lawyers present inside then. Some lawyers sustained head injuries. They also badly damaged eminent lawyer Prabhat Kumar Ray’s statue.” Ray is the father of state minister and Howrah Trinamool leader Arup Ray, himself a lawyer of the court. Wearing black badges, lawyers of Howrah court organised a procession and sat in dharna demanding immediate removal of the three IPS officers of Howrah City Police. Downtown Howrah — the area around M.G. Road of Kolkata’s sister city — had witnessed mayhem on Wednesday when lawyers of Howrah court and employees of Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) fought a pitched battle, triggered over the parking of a lawyer’s bike inside the HMC premise. Arup Ray, however, said, “I do not think police damaged my father’s statue. This is the handiwork of some outsiders, all miscreants. I want an impartial inquiry into the incident under the Howrah District Judge.” Howrah police commissioner Vishal Garg refused to comment on the issue on the ground that it was sub judice. A section of Howrah Municipal Corporation workers, meanwhile, observed a cease-work in protest against Wednesday’s violence. Gurupuda Chatterjee, Municipal Employees’ Union president said, “The way HMC employees were assaulted by lawyers over illegal parking by them, we will continue our protest.” HMC commissioner Bijin Krishna said: “We had issued a clear notification long ago that outsiders cannot park their cars or bikes within the premise of HMC headquarters. The accused lawyer refused to heed our security guard’s objection and tried to park his bike within the premise of HMC headquarters. When my guard protested, the accused physically assaulted him. A group lawyers later barged into HMC headquarters and assaulted employees of the license and health departments. The condition of two of our employees is serious. I have lodged an FIR against some unknown lawyers.” ",26 Apr 2019,2019-04-26 00:00:00

What is surprising is that the duo belonged to the aggrieved community itself. They admitted to the police that they created and spread the audio to provoke their members into “regaining our community pride”. The team led by additional deputy superintendents of police Elango and Anbalagan arrested G Selvakumar, 34, a resident of Manjavayal near Pattukottai in Thanjavur district, working in Singapore. He had returned to Chennai on Thursday night where the police arrested him at the international airport there. The police also arrested his accomplice C Vasanth, 30, from Pattukottai for inciting Selvakumar to create the hate audio about their community and their women. The police tracked them down by identifying an add-on WhatsApp account from which the audio originated. Selvakumar, at the behest of Vasanth, made two of his friends speak ill of the community and recorded it on phone at Westlite area in Singapore on April 14. The former spread the audio through Vasanth on April 17. The audio went viral and triggered violence at Ponnamaravathi and surrounding areas from the night of April 18. As the content of the audio created an impression that it was an attempt to malign the image of their community by those from another community, thousands of people from the community had launched a protest. They vandalized government and private vehicles besides blocking the road and throwing traffic out of gear on April 19 at Ponnmaravathi and nearby areas. . ",27 Apr 2019,2019-04-27 00:00:00

She was launching the election campaign of party candidate Kummanam Rajasekharan . The violence perpetrated against RSS and BJP workers in Kerala has increased significantly and CPM cadres have been functioning alongside police like they did in West Bengal, she alleged. Sitharaman, who later addressed a campaign rally, is the first among BJP’s national leaders to campaign in Kerala.“Is this democracy? Is there a kind of environment here for political parties to function fearlessly, or for people to go to polling booths or public meetings held by a party which they do not like,” she asked. Asserting that the elections were important ‘for keeping the momentum the economy gained since 2014, for a clean administration that took care of all sections of society and for continuing the comprehensive approach of reaching out to all’, Sitharaman said a vote to ‘lotus’ would be a direct vote to elect PM Narendra Modi back again. “We are reaching out to people to make them understand how important it is to bring back Modi government in the interest of the country. This is the spirit of our campaign,” Sitharaman also said the party made a detailed study with groups working at the grassroots-level and took pains to choose best candidate available for each constituency. “There’s no doubt that party has picked and chosen the best candidates available, and Kummanam Rajasekharan is one among them,” she added.

Turnout was high, with all five seats — Balurghat, Malda Uttar, Malda Dakshin, Murshidabad and Jangipur — recording at least 75% polling. But Abdul Kalam Tiarul Shiekh’s violent death stood out, prompting the Election Commission to seek a report from the district administration. In Malda, a presiding officer was removed from duty by the state chief electoral officer for casting bogus votes. “We are investigating the incident. We are not yet sure whether the clash was a result of a family feud or political rivalry. Three people, including main accused Lalu Shiekh, have been arrested,” additional director-general (law and order) Siddhinath Gupta said. Murshidabad Congress candidate Abu Hena claimed that Sheikh was from his party. Trinamool candidate Abu Taher said the death was unfortunate but his party supporters, too, came under attack. “How could this happen in the presence of central forces?” he asked. Alleged Trinamool goons tore open Tiarul’s belly with machetes, less than 400 metres from a sensitive booth manned by central forces, as he was walking back home with son Mahtab Sheikh after voting. “Trinamool goons Lalu Sheikh and Anroon started abusing us when we came out of the booth. My father didn’t respond. They hit us with bamboo poles. My dad fell down. They dragged my father away and tore open his belly with a machete,” Mahtab said. ",24 Apr 2019,2019-04-24 00:00:00
Lankan in city frets over brother’s fate,Lankan in city frets over brother’s fate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/lankan-in-city-frets-over-brothers-fate/articleshow/69015499.cms,en,"KOLKATA: The coordinated blasts in Colombo on Easter Sunday has left Maya Rawat perplexed. The Sri Lankan, married to an Indian entrepreneur — Dinesh Rawat — for nearly four decades, resides in Kolkata, but spends a few months with her family in Sri Lanka every year. Back in the city after a three-month trip to Colombo, Maya said she did not have any inkling of communal tension that could have led to the deadly blasts. “Sri Lanka saw a lot of violence and blasts during the Tamil uprising. But ever since the LTTE was crushed 10 years ago, the island nation has been an oasis of peace . This allowed tourism to flourish. The country has progressed on several fronts. Both Christians and Muslims in Colombo have lived peacefully,” said Maya, whose brother’s house is within half a kilometre of the three hotels that were targeted by suicide bombers. “Though there has been some friction between Buddhist monks and Muslims, it has been nothing like the trouble between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. I don’t believe the genesis of these blasts was in Sri Lanka,” she added. She has not been able to get in touch with family members as the Sri Lankan government suspended internet and phone services in the wake of the attacks. The government justified the suspension, citing it necessary to tackle the spread of false news and information that could fan ethnic tension. St Anthony’s Shrine in Kochchikade, Colombo, which was one of the three churches targeted in the coordinated attacks, is situated 1.5km from her brother’s residence. Maya recounted how people from various religions, including Islam, visit the 175-year-old Catholic church, popularly known as the ‘church of miracles’, to seek blessings. “This is why the attack reeks of outsiders’ involvement,” Maya reasoned. Last month’s mosque attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, saw at least 50 people murdered after a white supremacist went on a shooting rampage. The carnage began at lunchtime on a Friday, when mosques were full of worshippers. Many believe the attacks on Easter Sunday when churches in Sri Lanka were thronging with worshippers was a retaliation of the Christchurch carnage. In a special session of the Sri Lankan parliament on Tuesday, state minister of defence Ruwan Wijewardene said investigators were probing links between the local jihadist group National Thowheed Jamath and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen. Later, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the strikes that left 321 dead and more than 500 injured. Wijewardene also noted the Easter Sunday bombings could have been a retaliation for the terrorist attacks on two New Zealand mosques last month. Maya’s husband Dinesh, however, did not rule out underlying tensions between Buddhist monks and Muslims leading to the terror strike. “There have been sporadic incidents of right wing Buddhist monks targeting Muslims in Dehiwala and Kotahena localities. For years, Muslims have been at the receiving end. Tension has been simmering between the communities, but violence of this magnitude was not expected,” he said. But then why target Christians who make up barely 7% of the 22-million population? Dinesh reasoned that had Muslims targeted Sinhalese, they could have been wiped out just like the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the militant organisation that had waged war for a separate state for over three decades before it was decimated in a major assault by the Lankan army.

The charge-sheet has placed Yogesh Raj and other co-conspirators at scene of crime through technical and forensic evidences. As per the charge-sheet, accused Sachin Ahlawat made a call to Raj at 8.55am on December 3, informing him about an alleged cow-slaughter incident in Bulandshahr’s Mahav village. Based on the call detail record (CDR), police in its charge-sheet claimed that between 9am and 1:26pm, 11 phone calls were exchanged between Raj and other accused Ashish Chauhan, Satish Chandra, Sachin Jat, Pavan, Satyendra and Vishal Tyagi. In these telephonic exchanges, Raj directed the other accused to gather with their supporters at the scene of crime. All this while, the location of Raj shuffled between Nayabas and Siyana. To simplify things, police have also included a ray diagram explaining exchange of conversations among the accused. “It is clear that Sachin Ahlawat alerted Yogesh Raj about the cow slaughter incident in Mahav village on December 3. Upon intimation, the Bajrang Dal worker called others and directed them to reach the scene of crime. Later, the cow carcass was loaded in a tractor trolley and brought to Chingrawati police station,” the charge-sheet says. Meanwhile, Bruno Bhushan, the lawyer for Yogesh Raj and other four other accused, claimed that police have deliberately missed out on other details of the CDR. “Police have only included specific inputs of CDR to back their claim. Yogesh made calls to several senior police officers during the same time. But CDR was never made part of the case diary to ensure this thing never comes out.” He said that Yogesh was also in talks with the police and did not want violence. The Bulandshahr Police had filed the charge-sheet against 38 accused, including Raj and BJP youth wing leader Shikhar Agarwal in March. Out of the 38 accused, five were charge-sheeted for murder. A mob went on rampage on December 3 after a cow carcass was found in a sugarcane field near Mahav village of Siyana in Bulandshahr. Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh, who was posted at Siyana police station, was killed in the attack. A youth, Sumit Kumar, also lost his life during the violence. ",23 Apr 2019,2019-04-23 00:00:00

Patna, Bhojpur, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Begusarai and Khagaria are some of the districts in the state which will go to polls sans the ‘Maoist-hit’ tag this time. These districts were excluded from the left wing extremism list by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) in April last year. In 2018, the state had witnessed minimum Maoist violence when compared to the previous 13 years, thanks to a financial crackdown on top Maoist leaders by the Enforcement Directorate , which attached their movable and immovable properties worth several crores in the state. In August last year, the MHA had declared Aurangabad, Gaya, Jamui and Lakhisarai as 30 left wing extremism-affected districts in the country which record maximum Maoist violence. Aurangabad, Gaya, Jamui and Nawada will go to polls in the first phase on April 11. Chief electoral officer (CEO) H R Srinivasa told TOI over the phone that security forces would remain on full alert even in the districts which are no more considered as Maoist-infested. “We are on high alert. The areas in Jharkhand, which share border with four Maoist-hit constituencies in Bihar, are not going to polls in the first phase. This has to be kept in mind for making security arrangements,” he said. The last two general elections saw large scale Maoist violence in the state. In 2009 LS polls, seven people, including six security personnel, were killed in Maoist violence in the state. In 2014, five security personnel were killed and 16 injured in such attacks. According to data available with officials at the CEO office, a sub-inspector (SI), a magistrate and five constables were killed in Maoist attacks in 2009 general election. Of them, two constables were killed in Gaya, the SI, magistrate and three more constables lost their lives after Maoists triggered a landmine blast in Muzaffarpur. In Motihari too, a police vehicle was damaged in a landmine explosion. However, none died in the incident. In Gaya, five buildings were blown up by the Maoists in 2009. The rebels had also attacked police and polling parties. In Aurangabad, three buildings were blown up by the Maoists and two attacks reported on political leaders. In Rohtas, a police party was attacked. In Jamui also, one building was blown up. During 2014 general election, three security personnel were killed and eight injured in Aurangabad. In Munger, two security personnel were killed and eight injured. Central Reserve Police Force jawans had come under attack in Munger while they were on way to a polling station in Jamui parliamentary constituency. ",23 Mar 2019,2019-03-23 00:00:00

Journalist shot dead during riots in Northern Ireland,Journalist shot dead during riots in Northern Ireland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/journalist-shot-dead-in-norther-ireland-in-terrorist-incident/articleshow/68955101.cms,en,"DERRY: A journalist was shot dead during riots in Northern Ireland in what police on Friday were treating as a terrorist incident following the latest upsurge in violence to shake the troubled region. ""Lyra McKee was murdered during orchestrated violence in Creggan last night,"" assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton said in a statement. McKee, 29, had earlier posted an image that appeared to be from the riots in the Creggan housing estate in the city of Londonderry, also known as Derry, accompanied by the words ""Derry tonight. Absolute madness."" Images of the unrest posted on social media showed a car and van ablaze and hooded individuals throwing petrol bombs and fireworks at police vehicles. ""A single gunman fired shots in a residential area of the city and as a result wounded Ms McKee,"" said Hamilton, adding that police believed the gunman was a ""violent dissident republican"". ""We are treating this as a terrorist incident and we have launched a murder enquiry,"" he added. McKee had written for The Atlantic magazine and Buzzfeed News and was named by Forbes Magazine in 2016 as one of their ""30 under 30"" outstanding figures in media, according to her literary agent Janklow & Nesbit. Leona O'Neill, a reporter with the Belfast Telegraph , said she saw McKee get hurt. ""I was standing beside this young woman when she fell beside a police Land Rover tonight in Creggan #Derry. I called an ambulance for her but police put her in the back of their vehicle and rushed her to hospital where she died. Just 29 years old. Sick to my stomach tonight,"" she tweeted. Thursday's unrest raised memories of past decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned that ""we cannot allow those who want to propagate violence, fear and hate to drag us back to the past"". His British counterpart Theresa May said the killing was ""shocking and truly senseless"". In Brussels, a European Commission spokesman condemned the ""terrible incident"". ""We condemn such violence, and we are confident that the UK authorities will ascertain the exact circumstances of this tragic event,"" he said. Visiting US house of representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi joined in a minute's silence for McKee, saying it was ""especially poignant"", being held on Good Friday. The violence came in the run-up to the Easter weekend, when Republicans opposed to the British presence in Northern Ireland mark the anniversary of a 1916 uprising against British rule. A car-bombing and the hijacking of two vans in Londonderry earlier this year were also blamed on a dissident paramilitary group. Michelle O'Neill, the deputy leader of Irish republican party Sinn Fein, condemned the killing. ""My heart goes out to the family of the young woman shot dead by so-called dissidents,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""This was an attack on the community, an attack on the peace process and an attack on the Good Friday Agreement,"" the peace deal that largely brought an end to violence on the island exactly 21 years ago, she added, calling for calm. Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Union Party, which is in favour of Britain's presence in Northern Ireland, described the death as ""heartbreaking news"". ""A senseless act. A family has been torn apart. Those who brought guns onto our streets in the 70s, 80s & 90s were wrong. It is equally wrong in 2019. No one wants to go back,"" she wrote on Twitter. The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 largely brought an end to three decades of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland between republican and unionist paramilitaries, as well as British armed forces, in a period known as ""the Troubles"". Some 3,500 people were killed in the conflict — many at the hands of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Police have blamed a group called the New IRA for the flare-up in violence in recent months. Some have expressed fears that recent attacks could be a sign that paramilitaries are seeking to exploit the current political turbulence over Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland caused by Brexit. Londonderry was the scene of one of the darkest episodes in the Troubles in 1972, known as Bloody Sunday, when British troops opened fire on a civil rights demonstration and killed 13 people. A 14th victim later died of his wounds. A former British soldier was charged with murder last month over the killings. ",19 Apr 2019,2019-04-19 00:00:00
Ahmedabad: Man in void marriage ordered to maintain wife,Ahmedabad: Man in void marriage ordered to maintain wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/man-in-void-marriage-ordered-to-maintain-wife/articleshow/68972323.cms,en,"AHMEDABAD: A local court ordered a farmer to pay his wife maintenance under provisions of the Domestic Violence Act , after the court observed that the couple’s marriage was void. Laljibhai and Janakben Vaghela were married in December 15 and got their marriage registered in Nadiad. They got married while their earlier marriages were subsisting, without divorcing their previous spouses. The couple lived together for a year and had a daughter. After matrimonial discord, the woman was forced to leave her husband’s home with the infant girl. She filed a complaint under domestic violence laws and sought maintenance and compensation. Before the court, the husband disputed their marriage and accused the woman of threatening him with false cases to make the documents. The court had to decide whether the couple had co-habited and domestic violence really took place. The court answered these questions in the affirmative and ordered Vaghela to pay the woman and her daughter Rs 7,500 as monthly maintenance, besides Rs 10,000 compensation for domestic violence. Additional civil judge at the Mirzapur rural court Abhishek Sahu said, “As for the maintenance of the applicant, it may be seen that the marriage between the parties is a void marriage . And thus, the applicant is not eligible for proper maintenance from the opponent. However, the applicant will be required to be given maintenance for the part which she has been suffering due to domestic violence.” The court said that while Vaghela had his own house and agricultural land, the woman had nothing much to prove his income. However, the fact that they lived together as husband and wife entitled her to maintenance because domestic violence was proved. The woman has to bear the burden of the child and the expense of the rented house after being driven out of her matrimonial home. This led the court to pass a “reasonable order” keeping in mind the residential requirements and maintenance of the woman and her child. ",20 Apr 2019,2019-04-20 00:00:00

Polls in politically volatile Tripura have never been free of trouble. In 2018, the state registered 589 cases of political violence, the highest so far. The ruling BJP government, which came to power in March last year, claimed the spike was only because more cases were being booked by police. This time, however, the extent of disruptions and violence forced the Election Commission (EC) to defer polls to the Tripura East Lok Sabha constituency from April 18 to April 23. Since the announcement of the Lok Sabha election, at least 35 cases of political violence were reported in Tripura by Congress and CPM. As the elections drew near, the allegations grew more serious. Congress candidate from Tripura West Subal Bhowmik was attacked, allegedly by 50 BJP workers. CPM's re-contesting MP from Tripura West Sankar Prasad Datta also alleged that BJP workers had attacked his convoy at Sonamura. When the election to Tripura West was conducted on April 11, both Congress and CPM claimed 464 polling booths had been compromised because of large-scale rigging and voter intimidation by BJP workers. At least 10 cases of booth capturing have already been registered. Finally, just before the polls to tribal-majority Tripura East, voters in several areas of the constituency were greeted with a handwritten note, with a severed chicken's head hanging beside it, threatening people against voting on April 18 lest they should meet the same fate. On April 16, the EC announced the election had been deferred. The decision was taken after receiving the President's approval, based on a report from the returning officer of the constituency where he ""expressed serious apprehension that miscreant elements may thwart the polling process in the constituency, based on ground and intelligence reports and has requested for additional Central Armed Police Forces."" ""We came across media reports and videos on social media narrating how voting took place in the first phase (in Tripura West). There was no semblance of any order. You can't have the world's biggest democratic process function like this,"" said 60-year-old Jyotirmoy Deb, a businessman who will vote from Tripura East. ""Now, we are hopeful the Election Commission will do everything possible to make sure voters like me can exercise their franchise,"" he added. The EC, on its part, has employed two broad strategies to make polling possible in the constituency - additional deployment of central paramilitary forces and cracking down on disrupters. Additional DGP Rajiv Singh, under whose watch as a nodal officer Tripura West went to the polls, has been transferred. In addition, the poll panel has started filing FIRs against poll officials - presiding officers, poll officials, polling agents and political activists - whose activities led to the disorder. ""We have sent out a message to the people that if anything goes wrong on polling day, whoever is behind it will be held accountable. Anyone, irrespective of position or identity, who tries to create trouble will be booked. Police have already started booking trouble-makers,"" special chief electoral officer of Tripura, PR Bhattacharjee, told TOI. The poll panel has initiated confidence-building measures and stepped up patrolling. It now hopes more people will step out and vote. ""The situation is conducive to conducting the election. There is a visible change in the Tripura East constituency. The number of complaints have gone down and are not of serious nature. Additional forces will be reaching here in the next few hours,"" he added. As for Tripura West, alleged irregularities in polling to which spurred the decision to reschedule the Tripura East election, the EC is still working out how re-polling will be conducted. ""A review (of the first phase election process) is going on ... I think we might have to conduct repolling but it can be confirmed only after the EC finishes the review and sends a report. The commission is the final authority,"" Bhattacharjee added. BJP, which initially tried to deflect the debate by claiming this was a ""divisive"" plan by CPM and Congress and even saying that the opposition parties ""confused"" the EC with their complaints, sees the edge it has given to its opponents. ""Congress and the Left are upbeat. They complained against us and the polls got deferred, giving them more time to campaign,"" a BJP leader said. The BJP candidate from Tripura East, Rebati Mohan Tripura, on the other hand, was on Thursday served a notice for exceeding the spending limit. The saffron party is already on the back foot in the tribal-majority seat, where it is up against its own ally Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT), which holds five of the 13 tribal-reserved assembly segments, and refused to bow out of the contest in deference to its senior partner in the ruling coalition. Congress, meanwhile, has fielded a royal family member - Maharajkumari Pragya Debburman, daughter of late Kirit Bikram Kishore Debburman, the last king of Tripura - while CPM has fielded incumbent Jitendra Choudhury, president of the party's tribal wing.

The study says 13 incidents of communal violence were reported in rural Gujarat in 2018. “Communal riots in the past were restricted to urban areas. The spread of communal hatred and violence to rural areas has become evident in the last couple of years and continued in 2018. Social media platforms are a tool to spread hatred along religious lines,” the study says. In 2018, communal violence was reported in Kherda (Anand), Halvad (Morbi), Matar (Kheda), Chhatral (Gandhinagar), Sherpur (Idar), Vadali (Sabarkantha), Vaktapur (Sabarkantha), Sanjeli (Dahod) and Eral (Panchmahal) villages besides Fatehpura, Waghodiya and Nyay Mandir areas of Vadodara district, according to the study. “In six of these 13 incidents, social media had a key role in the spread of hate messages which eventually triggered communal tension and violence,” said Hozefa Ujjaini, who leads Buniyaad. “For instance, at Fatehpura in Vadodara, an alleged incident of stone-pelting at a Ram Navami procession, triggered a riot between two communities. According to locals, unidentified miscreants hurled stones at the procession, which brushed the statue of Lord Ram mounted atop an open truck. Provocative messages were then circulated on WhatsApp, which fuelled the riots,” he added. Analysis of communal incidents in Gujarat revealed that religious festivals, processions, rallies, inter-religious relationships, derogatory/controversial songs, eve-teasing and hate speech are trigger-points for communal riots. Gujarat had 1.06 crore internet subscribers in rural areas as on December 2018, according to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Explaining the impact of false messages on the rural populace, sociologist Gaurang Jani said, “Social media has given the rural population a platform to present their views. However, the mindset of rural people is usually quite conservative and therefore, fake news or messages on issues like inter-religious marriages go viral and can spark conflict very easily.” The study also analysed the financial losses incurred. Based on data from FIRs and investigation by the researchers, losses to the tune of Rs 2.62 crore were caused in these 13 incidents. ",20 Apr 2019,2019-04-20 00:00:00

There have been allegations of police inaction in controlling the stone pelters when some persons were damaging the property while shouting religious slogans. Senior police officers later rushed in additional forces and brought the situation under control by making some intervention. The rally was first allowed to be completed without any further trouble and district police claimed that action will be taken against those who were involved in stone pelting.

Leaders from both parties have been demanding that the police crack the whip against the opponents in connection with the attack on speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao on the day of polling at Inumetla village. Although the police lodged cases against both the groups, the pressure from the parties is making their job tough in probing the case. The police are feeling edgy particularly with the surveys on polling trends giving divided opinions. Although the ruling TDP is confident of returning to power, the celebratory mood in the YSRC camp has made the police wary of rushing into action mode. The police have already arrested some of the YSRC activists in connection with the attack on Sivaprasada Rao but they might wait for some more time before going tough with the other accused in the case, including YSRC candidate Ambati Rambabu and senior leader Basu Lingareddy. Similarly, the police booked cases against 22 TDP leaders and activists, including Sivaprasada Rao, following a complaint lodged by YSRC agent Shaik Imam in the Inumetla polling centre. He alleged that Sivaprasada Rao and others barged into the polling centre and threatened them with dire consequences. Sattenapalle DSP Kaleshavali said they have sought video clippings from the polling officials to probe the case. He said they would take further action in the case after getting the evidence. Interestingly, the police booked case against TDP leaders only after YSRC candidate and senior leader Ambati Rambabu issued ultimatum to stage hunger strike against police inaction. In fact, YSRC leaders have complained to chief electoral officer (CEO) on the alleged inaction by the police. “The police should have booked a case suo moto against Sivaprasada Rao and other TDP leaders for forcibly entering the polling booth and trying to rig votes. We have urged the CEO to probe as to what prompted the police to book the case almost three days after the polling,” Rambabu said. ",19 Apr 2019,2019-04-19 00:00:00

Dr Arun Gupta, head of Delhi Medical Council (DMC), said this was a much-needed directive. “It is the duty of the hospital to protect its employee and fight for him /her if the doctor or any other staff is attacked while on duty,” he said. DMC registrar Girish Tyagi also welcomed the government move. “I had raised this issue with chief secretary Vijay Dev recently, and it was reiterated with other senior members of Delhi Medical Association,” he said. In the last few years, incidence of violence against doctors have increased manifold. Patient perception of injustice within the medical sphere is a key factor, said an expert. “In public hospitals like ours, there’s no profit mongering. We work for 36 hours at a stretch with limited resources, and even after that get abused and assaulted,” said a senior resident at Safdarjung hospital. The hospital witnessed a day-long strike recently against the assault on a junior doctor by a patient and his attendants who allegedly broke the doctor’s nasal bones. The hospital doctor said the attack on them — physical, verbal and through social media — has become a trend. “We have become the favourite bashing boys. No one will go and ask the administration why there are such few ICU beds? They won’t go and ask the government why even after six decades since independence, the disparity in availability of super-specialty health services remains high across different regions,” said Dr Vivek Couksey, former president of the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association of India.

Union urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the Centre had no role in this as NGT had passed the order for Delhi Pollution Control Committee to take action against illegal entities and DPCC is under the city government. Puri accused Delhi government of “acting in panic” following the NGT order, and that in a keen jerk reaction, agencies took action against the scrap units, some of which already had permission to operate from the locality. “It (AAP) did not do anything for the past five years. Now, with the NGT saying that officials will be jailed, it went into panic mode and did something illegal...There was lack of responsibility from Delhi government. It did not even stop to see who was allowed and who wasn’t. The directions of NGT was for the Delhi government, not for the Centre,” he said. The minister said DPCC should have taken action in all these years. While some units have the consent to operate, others don’t. The owners of these should have gone to the DPCC and taken permission,” Puri said. He alleged that the Arvind Kejriwal government was busy spreading “fake and false narrative” to shy away from taking responsibility. Puri also claimed that DDA had not received any proposal for earmarking any area for carrying out the scrapping activities. He said though the Delhi master plan does not have any provision for scrap yard or market, the government would consider it once the proposal is forwarded by the city government.

In his address to the state BJP council meeting here Tuesday, chief minister Pema Khandu said justice would be delivered to the bereaved families and the people responsible for unleashing the violence would be brought to book. The probe would be carried out by a committee headed by a retired judge, a CMO communique said on Wednesday. Protests had erupted in Itanagar and adjoining Naharlagun in late February over the proposed grant of permanent resident certificates (PRC) to six non-Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe (APSTs) communities living in the Namsai and Changlang districts and to the Gorkhas living in Vijaynagar. Curfew clamped in Itanagar and Naharlagun town failed to deter protesters from venturing into the streets and pelting stones that left 35 people, including 24 police personnel, injured. The private residence of deputy chief minister Chowna Mein was set ablaze and the office of the Itanagar deputy commissioner ransacked. Clarifying that the state government had never intended to move a resolution or a bill in the Assembly over the PRC, Khandu said the matter was to be taken up for deliberations during a short-duration discussion in the House and to make the recommendations of the Joint High Power Committee (JHPC) on the PRC public. ""The state government had planned to make wider public consultation involving all stakeholders, community-based organisations, student organisations and other bodies,"" the chief minister said. The issue was ""misinterpreted"", causing unrest among the students, Khandu said. A statement was issued on social media platforms that the PRC issue would not be taken up further, he said.

Maliwal is on the seventh day of the Mahila Suraksha Padyatra to meet women from all spheres of life, many of whom complained about the increasing incidents of domestic violence and dowry to her. A common problem all women faced, they said, was that there was no support from the police in such cases. Maliwal joined hands with them by holding up a belan (rolling pin) as a reminder to women to be self-reliant when facing physical abuse at home. The Mahila Suraksha Yatra on Saturday covered areas like Peeragarhi , Paschim Vihar , Khayala, Tilak Nagar, Janakpuri and Dabri. Maliwal issued a notice to all DCPs regarding the pendency of domestic violence cases under their jurisdiction. As per the data available with DCW , FIRs have been registered in 15,698 cases of domestic violence but the chargesheet has been filed only in 5,573 cases, which is a dismal 35.5%. Several hundred of the cases are pending investigation since last five years. Officials said that the data showing severe pendency validates the complaints of women that cases of domestic violence do not figure in the priority list of the police. Seeking redressal for genuine victims of domestic violence, the Commission has directed the police to provide the details of cases (u/s 498A, 406 IPC) where investigation is pending since 2012 in each district, with reasons for non-filing of charge-sheet/final report, status report of the case and the expected date by which charge-sheet/final report shall be filed in the court. The DCW has also sought the steps undertaken to sensitise the police force regarding prosecuting women who file false cases and also refrain from creating the impression that majority of domestic violence cases are false when statistically it is not true.

"Congress may promise law to curb mob violence, lynchings","Congress may promise law to curb mob violence, lynchings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-may-promise-law-to-curb-mob-violence-lynchings/articleshow/68639099.cms,en,"NEW DELHI: In a significant initiative, Congress is likely to promise a new law against hate crimes, a likely omnibus measure to deter lynchings , in its 2019 election manifesto . The party, it is learnt, has veered towards a clear commitment to curb mob violence and lynchings. The Congress has accused BJP of encouraging attacks by mobs, particularly cow vigilantes which has seen several civil society groups criticise the Modi government. Sources said the carefully crafted manifesto promise would be limited to stating that if voted to power, a Congress government would institute a special law to deal with crimes of hate/mob violence. The party is likely to tread carefully, having itself adopted the ""gau raksha"" theme in recent state elections. Special laws, with provisions of stringent punishment and fast-track courts, have long been identified as sources of deterrent. The manifesto will steer clear of mentioning cow-lynchings, the single most controversial type of mob violence, and the inspiration behind the Congress poll promise appears to be multi-dimensional. Sources said hate crimes are of communal nature but are also triggered by anti-caste feelings, moral policing and rumours. The last category is important in view of lynchings provoked by fake news on WhatsApp and Facebook about child lifters being on the prowl in a village or town. Either way, the election promise for an anti-hate law would be the Congress way of making an ideological statement in its clash with BJP for the national sweepstakes. Ever since they hit the headlines post-Akhlaq killing in Dadri village in western Uttar Pradesh, lynchings have come to be identified with cows. Most of its victims have been Muslims though Dalits too have been targeted in many cases. As incidents continued, the BJP-led Centre and states came under severe criticism for not doing enough to check vigilantism. It led to widespread allegations that lynchings had become a political tool to effect religious polarisation. Even PM Modi too had in a public function asked CMs to crack down on cow vigilantes. While most of the mob killings like Akhlaq and Pehlu Khan were about beef and cows, Junaid Khan was thrown out of a train in Palwal in Haryana by a group of men in what was reported to be a communal incident. In this specific context, anti-Dalit crimes came to national notice with Una floggings in Gujarat when seven members of a Dalit family were targeted for skinning a dead cow. The perpetrators recorded the atrocities in a video which went viral and triggered national outrage. By general reckoning, ""hate crimes"" largely constitute crimes against religious minorities. In a way, it may be a repeat of the ""anti-communal violence bill"" which the UPA government had promised and attempted to craft but without success over its definition of a victim as being a member of a minority group only. The biggest hurdle in such cases is that ""law and order"" is a ""state subject"" and the states are loathe to allow any interference on their domain. ",29 Mar 2019,2019-03-29 00:00:00

The situation, however, looked peaceful in Guntur city and Krishna delta region comprising Tenali, Repalle, Bapatla and Ponnur assembly segments. In the volatile Palnadu region, TDP and YSRC workers clashed in Narasaraopet, Gurazala and Sattenapalle assembly constituencies. The situation took a turn for the worse at Inumetla village, where AP assembly speaker and TDP candidate for Sattenapalle assembly constituency Kodela Sivaprasada Rao was attacked by a group of people allegedly owing allegiance to YSRC. The incident happened when Kodela reached Inumetla village in Rajupalem mandal to oversee the polling process on Thursday morning and entered into an argument with YSRC activists present at the polling venue. When Kodela tried to enter the polling station, he was stopped and shoved by the opposition group. With TDP activists too joining the tussle, the situation slipped out of control. Sensing trouble, Kodela’s security staff immediately whisked him away from the spot. Kodela also suffered minor injuries in the tussle between TDP and YSRC activists. As the news spread, clashes between TDP and YSRC cadre were reported from other parts of the constituency too. YSRC activists reportedly chased and attacked TDP candidate Aravind Babu at Uppalapadu village in Narasaraopet assembly constituency. The mob also chased media personnel and destroyed their equipment. In Yallamanda, TDP workers attacked sitting MLA and YSRC candidate Gopireddy Srinivasa Reddy when he visited the village, a stronghold of the TDP, following reports of rigging by ruling party cadre. The TDP activists pelted stones on his vehicle and prevented him from entering the village. Though Reddy had police escorts, they were outnumbered by the big mob, who attacked him with sticks resulting in him suffering a fracture on his left hand. Reddy immediately filed a complaint with rural SP Rajasekhara Babu, alleging that TDP workers were resorting to attacks out of frustration as they have realised that their party will be wiped out in the elections. Tension prevailed at many polling stations in Gurazala constituency where TDP activists thrashed an YSRC polling agent at Srinivasapuram polling booth in Dachepalle mandal. They also threatened locals of dire consequences if they voted for YSRC. YSRC leaders said the police were aiding the TDP candidate by creating panic among voters in YSRC strongholds. YSRC candidate Kasu Mahesh Reddy lodged a complaint with district collector Kona Sasidhar and CEO Gopalakrishna Dwivedi to depute additional forces in Gurazala constituency. Although polling began on slow pace, it picked up in the afternoon. The district reported 8.4% voting till 9am largely due to EVMs playing truant in nearly 200 polling centres in the first two hours. Chief electoral officer Gopalakrishna Dwivedi was left red faced when he could not vote with the EVM not working in Christianpet polling centre in Tadepalle mandal. Dwivedi, however, returned in the afternoon and exercised his franchise. The polling rose to 21% till 11am and touched 36% by 1pm.

But people have been defying the curfew and coming out on to the streets to register their protest. On Monday, no fresh violence was reported. The Army, paramilitary forces, the Arunachal Scouts and other security forces marched through the streets of violence-hit Itanagar and Naharlagun. Arunachal chief minister Pema Khandu on Monday, once again, clarified that the government is not pursuing PRCs for non-indigenous communities. ""I appeal to the people of Arunachal Pradesh that the PRC issue is being ended, please end the protest and rallies and cooperate with the government to maintain peace,"" he said. Despite the CM's assurances, not much has changed in the state. He added, ""I clarified the government's stand on February 22 that we are not taking the PRC matter forward and want to reassure the people that we will not take up the issue of issuing PRCs to those from non-indigenous Scheduled Tribes in the future.

SSP Anand Kulkarni, too, has asked the Lanka police to lodge an FIR against all those who indulged in unlawful activities on the campus. “After identification of 18 students involved in unlawful activities, police teams have been sent to them with notices regarding completion of bail process in a day or two. Failing which, police will issue non-bailable warrants against them,” said Kulkarni. Earlier on Sunday, a group of students from Birla A hostel had thrashed junior students of Birla C hostel, prompting a clash where stones and petrol bombs were hurled on the Hostel road. They had also targeted chief proctor Royana Singh and proctorial board personnel. The situation was brought under control by SP city Dinesh Kumar Singh, who had reached the campus with heavy police force. However, despite deployment of police force and university security personnel, both the groups again clashed on Monday afternoon. Police used mild force to disperse the warring students. The SSP has deployed more police force and PAC on the campus. Inspector Lanka Bharat Bhushan said, “Following Sunday night violence an injured student Kumar Mangalam had lodged an FIR against the rival group. On Monday morning, the rival group lodged an FIR against him and his companions. About 18 students involved in unlawful activities have been identified with the help of video and CCTV footages.” SSP said, “Following identification of the troublemakers, police have been sent to their homes with notices to their parents. They will have to ensure that their wards appear before the police and complete the bail process.” ",26 Feb 2019,2019-02-26 00:00:00

Asha Devi (mother of Nirbhaya), Laxmi Agarwal (activist for acid attack survivors) and Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi (renowned LGBTQ activist) shared their experiences at an event in the city to empower survivors. Narrating their stories and what inspired them to fight out the circumstances and emerge as inspiration to thousands of people, the three women said that assault cases need to be handled in a better way. They stressed on the importance of standing up instead of brushing cases under the carpet. Speaking about the struggles her daughter faced, Asha Devi said that seeing her daughter going through the pain and eventually losing gave her the strength to fight for the rights of women across India. “I remember how she used to ask for water when she was in the hospital and I had to say no. Her body was mutilated to such an extent that we could not even give her water to drink. She survived for 10 days in so much pain and her pain became my strength to fight for justice,” said Asha Devi. For the past six years, Asha Devi has been fighting to get justice for her daughter and working to empower women in India. Similarly, Laxmi Agarwal, who was a victim of acid attack in 2005, spoke about how she restarted life. “He threw acid on my face, not on my dreams,” said Laxmi, who is now a campaigner with Stop Sale Acid. Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi, India’s first transgender to represent her community at the UN, spoke about the importance of self-love. “One should know how to stand up for themselves and come out of the dark times. I firmly believe that even if you have the best laws, nothing will change unless you change the mindset of people,” said Lakshmi. ",23 Apr 2019,2019-04-23 00:00:00
Prime time is no crime time,Prime time is no crime time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/prime-time-is-no-crime-time/articleshow/68514928.cms,en,"CHENNAI: The Madras high court recently asked the states and the Centre to find out if television serials and films with extramarital relationships or murder in their plot lines are responsible for the rising crime rates. In the absence of any data linking murders and adultery to movies and serials, experts feel singling out the entertainment sector and holding it responsible for such acts is unfair. Though films are a powerful medium of communication and filmmakers share the onus of portraying violence and social evils responsibly, making the entertainment sector a scapegoat, ignores the root cause for criminal activity, they feel. Former judge of the Madras high court K Chandru says linking crimes to celluloid is a naive approach. ""If a person is caught copying in exams, we say ‘Munna Bhai’ method and if it’s a runaway marriage, ‘Alaipayuthey’ style but these are verbal statements to make sense of a situation, it does not mean these movies are directly responsible. ""Ever since the IPC was created in 1860, various pieces of legislation have been passed to control crime, but it never could put an end to it. A person after watching a movie may get carried away and if he implements the same in real life, it goes to show his character. A bench with suo motu files can’t pass orders that are not relevant to today’s times."" Actor and politician Khushbu feels such observations are a simplistic way of looking at things. She argues that if violent serials and movies can motivate some people to commit immoral or criminal acts, then there’s also a huge section that is inspired by the good deeds shown on screen. For instance ‘Munna Bhai’s ‘jadu ki jhappi’ (magic of a hug) is more remembered than the fraud dealings of the character. ""Recently there was an incident of a man stabbing his wife inside the court premises, now which cinema or serial can be blamed for such a heinous act. If it can happen in a protected environment like within the court premises, imagine the scale of brazenness people adopt doing such acts elsewhere. It depends on the upbringing, environment and mindset of a person. Also, as an industry, we have hit out at such things through films and in reality,"" says Khushbu. After the 2014 Nirbhaya incident, the film industry faced a backlash over commodification of women, disregarding the complexities that led to such an act. Misogyny in films is undeniable, but filmmakers are becoming increasingly aware of the need for context and sensitivity while portraying characters. Kutty Padmini, actor and MD of Vaishnave Mediaa Works agrees with the court observation. The veteran actor, who had been producing television serials till a decade ago, stopped it because she did not want to be associated with stories that revolve around negativity. ""Stale plots that deal with the murder of daughters-in-law and husbands reek of low values. A few months ago, we witnessed a producer killing his wife, chopping her body into pieces and strewing them in a dump yard. He had confessed to having drawn inspiration from films. It shows that as a responsible medium, we should be cautious of the message we put out,"" says Padmini. Producer and founder-dean of BOFTA G Dhananjayan feels television serials should also keep values in mind. ""Why can’t we go for content that does not glorify adultery or vengeance. A good film does more than entertain or fill seats at the cinema, it has the power to change hearts and minds – and sometimes society at large,"" he says. Spiralling crime in society cannot be simplified and presumed to be because of serials and movies. Cinema may be a contributor, but singling it out is no solution. After all, how many culprits have confessed to emulating a scene from a crime thriller? ",22 Mar 2019,2019-03-22 00:00:00

The AAP government had tried to uproot the traders with the help of DPCC and later reversed its stand, the former chief minister said. In such a situation in 2006, her government had taken corrective steps and the Congress-led central government had issued an ordinance, Dikshit said. But the Modi government has turned a blind eye to the plight of small traders, she alleged. BJP and AAP seem to be hand-in-glove to disturb peace as they want to divert people’s attention from their governance failures and create an atmosphere of tension, she alleged. Dikshit urged the election commission to take action against the officials responsible for such “high-handed behaviour” when the Lok Sabha poll campaign is taking place. SDMC mayor Narendra Chawla has requested the Delhi chief secretary to transfer the work of a survey on polluting industries to DPCC or the industries department. ",16 Apr 2019,2019-04-16 00:00:00
Marital violence top cause why women turn homeless,Marital violence top cause why women turn homeless,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/marital-violence-top-cause-why-women-turn-homeless/articleshow/68505725.cms,en,"NEW DELHI: A study based on survivor accounts who have either lived or are currently residing in shelter homes in five states has highlighted that marriage related domestic violence is a primary cause for short and long-term homelessness of women. It also turned out that most survivors were unaware of their right to residence under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The study also took into account women who are at risk of landing in shelter homes due to their vulnerable circumstances. Analysis of the accounts of 147 women survivors of violence from Delhi, north and south Karnataka, Assam , Meghalaya and Tamil Nadu and visits to 78 shelter homes shows that other reasons for which women were either abandoned or felt compelled to leave their families include sexual assault, old age, trafficking, opposition to women’s choices, abuse related to sexual orientation and physical and mental health issues. Titled - “Survivor Speak - Call for Action from Five States” the report draws out common findings from the state specific reports to highlight the concerns of women who live or have lived in shelter homes being run by NGOs under the government schemes like the Swadhar Greh scheme. Aimed at making shelters empowering spaces that offer rights-based support system to women, civil society networks came together in 2016 to form a diverse national network Lam-Lynti Chittara Neralu (an amalgamation of three languages Khasi, Telugu and Kannada that means to lead the way under the vista of stars). “The ground research on shelter is seen as a step to highlight the concerns raised by the survivors,” lead researcher from the network, Dr Amrita Nandy, said. The women organisations who are part of the network feel independent audits of all shelter homes is the need of the hour. They also want survivors who have lived in shelters to be part of the audit exercise. The study sample from Assam, Delhi, Meghalya and Tamil Nadu shows that 31 women survivors were married or were in a live-in arrangement, 29 women survivors were married but separated, 12 were widowed, 10 were abandoned and 27 were unmarried. In Delhi, of the 28 respondents spoken to, nine women had experienced abuse of some form in their natal families, including child sexual abuse . Four survivors had come to Delhi to seek shelter away from their families. For most survivors of violence moving to a shelter home was only seen as a last resort. The reasons that kept women away from taking refuge in a shelter were separation from children, a sense of alienation they experience in shelters and curbs on communication and mobility. In Karnataka during a focus group discussion, devadasi women reported being denied admission by the shelter homes. The study also highlights that the shelters are not inclusive spaces in the context of “women” who figure in the spectrum defined as LGBTQI community. Besides low remuneration to staff, nearly all shelter homes flagged issues of inadequate and irregular disbursal of funds. ",21 Mar 2019,2019-03-21 00:00:00

Thousands of students were protesting near the deputy commissioner’s office seeking action against culprits involved in the alleged rape and murder of an engineering student reported recently. The girl’s body was found hanging on a hillock on the outskirts of Raichur. When police stopped the agitators from entering the DC’s office by closing its gate, the latter threw water packets, slippers and stones towards the office. One of the stones fell on the district president of Vishwakarma community , Guru Vishwakarma, injuring him. The protesters were reportedly trying to enter the office to submit a memorandum. The rally seeking justice for the 21-year-old student started at Manikprabhu Temple. The protesters comprised women from Jain and minority communities, students and members of AIDSO, SFI, AIDYO, ABVP and Youth Congress. Kannada actors Harshika and Bhuvan, who were also part of the rally, demanded a fair investigation. When a leader of the community — to which the girl belonged — tried to immolate himself, police stopped him from doing so and rushed him to hospital. The agitators later demanded the DC come to the protest venue and receive the memorandum. When the situation was about to go out of control, Raichur DC Sharath B heeded the demand. Police took one person into custody for stone-pelting. In Ballari, District Viswakarma Vikas Vedike held a peaceful protest, condemning the student’s death. 2 cops suspended for refusing to file case Police sub-inspector Mariyamma and constable (writer) Anjaneya, both attached to the Raichur women’s police station, have been suspended for allegedly not registering the girl’s death case initially.

CID is probing the alleged rape and murder of the girl, whose decomposed body was found hanging from a tree in a forest on the outskirts of Raichur on April 16. The girl’s mother had filed a complaint accusing Yadav of murdering her daughter after raping her. Raichur police arrested Yadav on April 18 after booking him under sections 376 (rape) and 302 (murder) of IPC. “The accused has been questioned about his relationship with the girl. Her mother had complained that Yadav was harassing and stalking her for a long time, forcing her to skip college. On April 13, the day she went missing, Yadav was seen near her house,” sources said.

Francis skipped his homily during Easter Mass but delivered his traditional ""Urbi et Orbi"" (To the city and the world) speech highlighting conflicts in the Mideast, Africa and the Americas and demanding that political leaders put aside their differences and work instead for peace. ""May the one who gives us his peace end the roar of arms, both in areas of conflict and in our cities, and inspire the leaders of nations to work for an end to the arms race and the troubling spread of weaponry, especially in the economically more advanced countries,"" Francis said from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica overlooking the flower-decked square below. In a special appeal at the end, Francis lamented the ""grave attacks"" on Sri Lankan hotels and churches, which occurred just as the Christian faithful were celebrating Easter Mass that marks the resurrection of Christ following his crucifixion. ""I want to express my loving closeness to the Christian community, targeted while they were gathered in prayer, and all the victims of such cruel violence,"" Francis said. ""I entrust to the Lord all those who were tragically killed and pray for the injured and all those who are suffering as a result of this dramatic event."" Scores were killed and hundreds wounded following near-simultaneous blasts at Sri Lankan churches and hotels frequented by foreigners. In his roundup of global conflicts, Francis warned that the world was increasingly becoming resigned to the ongoing conflict in Syria. He called for a ""renewed commitment for a political solution"" that would respond to Syrians' need for freedom, peace and justice and allow for millions of refugees to return home. In Yemen, he lamented how children in particular are ""exhausted by hunger and war,"" while in North Africa, Libyans are enduring a fresh round of fighting between rival forces battling for control of Tripoli, the capital ""I urge the parties involved to choose dialogue over force and to avoid reopening wounds left by a decade of conflicts and political instability,"" he said of Libyan leaders. Francis said he hoped the political and religious leaders of South Sudan would open a ""new page in the history of the country"" and work for reconciliation. Francis hosted South Sudan's president and opposition leader for a remarkable retreat at the Vatican earlier this month, during which the pope bowed down and kissed their feet, begging them to work for peace. And history's first Latin American pope also offered prayers for Venezuelans and Nicaraguans experiencing political and economic hardship and ""all those who lack the minimal conditions for leading a dignified and secure life due to a crisis that endures and worsens."" The Vatican said popes sometimes either deliver an off-the-cuff homily on Easter Sunday or skip it altogether, given the lengthy speech and blessing that follows. The 82-year-old Francis has just completed an exhausting few days of Holy Week commemorations, including travelling to a prison outside Rome to wash the feet of inmates on Holy Thursday, presiding over the Way of the Cross procession at Rome's Colosseum on Good Friday and celebrating the Easter Vigil late Saturday night in St. Peter's Basilica.

Arjun Singh was with Trinamool then. Three months later, on Thursday, BJP activists took control of the office. Flags atop the building changed, but not the framed pictures inside, because Singh is with BJP now. The Atpur Trinamool party office at Ward 20 of the Bhatpara Municipality got a fresh coat of saffron paint minutes after Singh joined BJP in New Delhi. Curious eyes watched the men at work fearing what is in store. Pro-Arjun councillors had got the message earlier. They gathered at the Bhatpara Municipality office and distributed sweets to celebrate the changeover. Bhatpara Municipality vice-chairman Somnath Talukdar was among the few, who went to the Trinamool district party office at Madhyamgram to chalk out the party’s strategy after the chairman left the party. “Trinamool has a majority in the Bhatpara Municipality still. We can prove our majority at the opportune moment,” Talukdar said after coming back from Madhyamgram. As many as seven Trinamool councillors have already complained to Trinamool leader Nirmal Ghosh that they are getting threat calls from Arjun Singh loyalists. Food minister Jyoti Priya Mullick have asked these councillors to lodge a police complaint and ask for security. The battle of words has fuelled apprehensions of largescale violence in the area used to extortions and gang wars. Fear was writ large on the faces of the residents at Jagaddal’s Meghna More near Singh’s residence. Two policemen guarded the office-cum-residence of the Bhatpara MLA and Municipality chairman where he meets locals. “People came here yesterday. There are no visitors for him today,” a policeman said. The streets looked deserted with the entire locality fearing a showdown ahead of the polls. “We are scared. Street fights and gun battles are a regular these days in this locality. I fear that Singh’s joining BJP will escalate the tension further. I would expect the police to take steps to maintain peace in the locality,” said milk trader Subhrangshu Banerjee. Kashinath Debnath, a former employee of the Hukumchand Jute Mill, also kept fingers crossed. “This area has a mixed population. Singh and his men have a command over the Hindispeaking jute mill workers who came from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They are innocent and insecure people and easily come under the clutches of politicians. There has been a surge in BJP support at Jagaddal, Halisahar, Garulia and Kankinara,” Debnath said. Singh loyalist and Trinamool councillor of Titagarh Municipality, Manish Shukla, though, ruled out any such possibility. “We told Arjunda a week ago that we are going to stay with Trinamool even if he joins BJP,” Shukla said. Singh’s brother-in-law and Noapara MLA Sunil Singh is also staying back. But that doesn’t seem reassuring to the Jagaddal residents. Knives are out against “gaddars” while the Arjun brigade is getting set for retaliation. BJP leader Mukul Roy’s son and Trinamool MLA from Bijpur Subhranshu Roy tried to pacify nerves. “I was with Trinamool and am still with the party. I was under tremendous pressure when my father changed party affiliations. I would wish that pressure doesn’t come on Arjun’s wife and son,” he said. ",15 Mar 2019,2019-03-15 00:00:00

Addressing the inaugural session, Ashoka University (Haryana) faculty member A K Shiva Kumar said, “Although there are sufficient number of laws for ensuring children’s welfare, they are not implemented properly.” CNLU vice-chancellor Justice (retired) Mridula Mishra threw light on hypersensitiveness of children and different forms of exploitation at home and outside. She pleaded for creating a friendly ambience where children can share experiences freely. Bihar Law Commission member Abhijeet Sinha, Bihar Legal Services Authority secretary Sunil Dutt Mishra and CNLU registrar Manoranjan Prasad Srivastava also expressed their views at the workshop. Students from Patna Women’s College, Magadh Mahila College, Patna Law College, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and Amity University as well as representatives of several organizations, including UNICEF, Human Liberty Network, Sakhi, Sarthi, and Prayas, attended the workshop. Patna varsity: Patna University (PU) students and faculty members will soon study the problems of people living in rural areas and turn some of them into smart villages by providing technological solutions. This was decided at a recent meeting of the heads of five postgraduate (PG) departments and the National Service Scheme programme coordinator under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor (VC) Rash Bihari Prasad Singh. To start with, 10 students from each department — history, geography, sociology, education and law — will visit the selected villages in a month and conduct a survey of the various facilities available as well as their requirements. PU has already selected the villages — Dhibra (Jamsaut panchayat of Danapur block), Chhitnawan (Khashipur panchayat of Maner block), Dhaulpura (Marchi panchayat of Patna Sadar), Saim Chak (Chilbilli panchayat of Phulwari block) and Bahuwara (Chipura panchayat of Sampatchak block) — under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA), a flagship programme launched by the Union HRD ministry for transfer of knowledge to enrich rural India. The district administration has helped the university in identifying these villages for the development plan. PU is expected to work closely with the district administration to provide customized technological solutions, undertake field studies, study government schemes and facilitate their implementation according to local needs. All the teachers, students, officials and non-teaching staff of the university and its colleges will be associated with this scheme for apprising them with the rural realities. “Students and faculty members will study the living conditions in the adopted villages and assess the local problems and needs. They will work out the possibilities of leveraging the technological interventions and the need to improve the processes in implementation of various government schemes and prepare workable action plans for the selected villages. Experts from IITs will provide technological solutions to the problems identified in these villages,” PU NSS programme and UBA coordinator Atul Aditya Pandey said and added students from other departments, including rural studies, PMIR and social work, would also come forward for the noble venture later.

Pune's assistant commissioner of police Shivaji Pawar said this in an affidavit filed before the court to oppose the bail plea filed by one of the accused, Arun Ferriera. Apart from Ferriera, the police earlier arrested eight other activists, including Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj , P Varavara Rao, Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde . Ferriera and Gonsalves later filed bail petitions which came up for hearing on Wednesday before Justice P N Deshmukh, who posted the matter for April 5. The police are yet to submit the affidavit over Gonsalves's petition. In their affidavit, Pune police claimed that Ferriera and the other accused were senior members of the banned terrorist organisation, Communist Party of India (Maoist). They were ""actively supporting and propagating the banned outfit's unlawful activities to overthrow the government established by law"", the police said. During investigation, it was revealed that the motive of the CPI (Maoist) was ""seizure of political power,"" the affidavit said further. ""With a view to attain this motive, the organisation is waging not the old type of conventional war but a people's war by mobilising public on a massive scale both military and politically,"" it said. ""The CPI (Maoist) is undertaking special efforts to build the party among Dalit masses. They try to rally Dalit masses extensively by taking up struggles for their self- respect and against discrimination, oppression, degradation and physical attacks by the upper caste feudal forces in order to achieve their motive,"" the police said in the affidavit. The Elgar Parishad meeting held on December 31, 2017, during which Ferreira and the other accused gave ""inflammatory, provocative and rebellious"" speeches, saw significant participation of Dalit organisations, they said. ""These Dalit organisations were systematically brought together by some active members of CPI (Maoist), which had also funded this meeting,"" the affidavit said. The police claimed Ferreira and another accused Vernon Gonsalves were senior cadres of CPI (Maoist) and engaged in recruiting cadres for the banned outfit. ""The intention of Ferreira and other accused persons along with the banned terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist) is to topple the democratically elected governments (Centre and state) by violent means, that is by creating mayhem, spreading terror and hatred,"" the affidavit said.

Ferriera and other accused distributed pamphlets and booklets with an intention to incite, abet and promote enmity between different groups on the ground of religion, caste and community, it said. ""They created disharmony and a feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious groups, castes and communities and therefore, disturbed public tranquillity,"" the affidavit said. ""Net result of the meeting and speeches was riots that erupted at Bhima-Koregaon on January 1, 2018,"" it said. It was found from certain documents and evidence collected from the accused persons' residences that they were part of a criminal conspiracy and their role was not merely peripheral, but they were found to be playing a vital role in the offences committed, the police said in the affidavit.

They are a threat to the university and need to be tackled properly, said vice-chancellor of Nagpur University SP Kane, on Friday. Kane said these words in his presidential address at the 17th edition of ‘Justa Causa’, a three-day national festival, at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar College of Law. Kane said, “A society cannot function without the existence of law. Therefore, laws are needed to be formulated and amended as time progresses. In a court, there are lawyers and judges. Nobody ever questions the decisions of the judge. However, in a university, the VC has to play both, the lawyer and the judge, if the decisions are challenged.” Former high court judge Vasanti Naik was the chief guest of the inaugural function. Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam and college principal Shrikant Komawar were also present. Delivering the keynote address, Nikam said, “Women have every right to lead a peaceful life and not resign their fate to the never-ending cycle of enduring domestic violence and discrimination.” To mark the International Women’s Day, the theme of the law festival is ‘Protection of women against domestic violence’. Nikam said, “Domestic violence is a torturous phenomenon which is not confined to any race, caste or creed. Every country is faced with this problem for which an effective solution should be evolved.” “We advocates, at present, lack depth of knowledge and are therefore losing credibility. Good lawyers should possess qualities like honesty and integrity, backed by deep study of law, to excel in the field,” he said. He said, “The tongue of an advocate is mightier than pen and sword as it can serve punishment to the guilty and set the innocent free. Advocacy is an individualistic art that requires practical and legal training.” In her address, Justice (retd) Naik provided an insight into Domestic Violence Act. There were many central and state laws, but they were inadequate. The Domestic Violence Act, in force since October 26, 2007, is path-breaking, she added. Komawar said, “The sapling of ‘Justa Causa’ was sown 17 years ago and we have tried our best to nurture it. This event has a noble cause of polishing skills of the aspiring lawyers from across the country.” He said 20 teams from premier law institutions are participating in the festival. Activities like moot court, seminar, legal drafting, debate competitions and general quiz will be organized during the period, he added. Chinmayee Nimkhedkar and Mrunmayee Kukdey conducted the inaugural function. Kalyani Kapse proposed a vote of thanks. Pravina Khobragade and Adhara Deshpande are the conveners of the event.

During a meeting held on JAP-I campus, the officials decided to continue with their policy of hot pursuit against the extremists so that they could not stay at one place for long to plan violent acts. In addition, action plan for joint operations against inter-state and inter-district gangs, absconders and anti-social elements, who could disrupt election process, was also prepared. Those who attended the meeting included DIG (Ranchi range) Amol V Homkar, DIG (Kolhan range) Kuldeep Dwivedi, DIG (Hazaribag range) Pankaj Kamboj, CRPF DIGs — Suresh Sharma and Manish Sachhar — and SPs of several districts including Ranchi, Hazaribag, Ramgarh, Chatra, Latehar, Bokaro and Chaibasa.

We are building upon the past achievements to ensure peaceful elections in Jharkhand,” he said. Kolhan range DIG, Dwivedi, said, “Our focus is on creating a safe environment for voting. We have drawn plans to trace and chase out the extremists who are active in inter-district borders.

The conviction rate has also plummeted. Cases pertaining to domestic violence against women and dowry harassment are registered under IPC Section 498A, titled ‘husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty’. In 2013, a total of 3,187 cases were registered against husbands; the number dipped to 2,102 in 2018. The convictions in the corresponding period fell from 43 to 0. Stakeholders point to different reasons for the trend. According to police, change in family size and lifestyle, including interfaith and intercaste marriages, have hugely contributed to the decline . “Also, a poor conviction rate discourages women from raising complaints against their husbands. Out-of-court settlements, lack of evidence and victims turning hostile are plaguing the system,” police officers said. TimesView The decline in dowry cases is a positive development, given the physical, mental and emotional trauma women have experienced for ages due to the misogynist practice. Though nuclear families, intercaste marriages and police intervention seem to have helped, the figures may not be an accurate representation of the ground reality as some cases still go unreported due to family pressure and social stigma. On the flip side, the anti-dowry law can be a double-edged sword, giving women the scope to misuse it for personal vendetta. While a thorough investigation can help police identify genuine cases, a change in mindset will go a long way in eradicating the menace. Additional director general of police (law and order) Kamal Pant said, “Most dowry harassment cases come from joint families. Women complain against in-laws, sisters-in-law and brothers-in law. Often, the husbands wouldn’t have demanded anything. But others would have tortured the women. Now, nuclear families are increasing and mostly, both husband and wife work.” “Intercaste and interfaith marriages also contribute to the dip. As the marriages would have happened as a matter of choice, the question of dowry doesn’t arise,” he explained. Activists working to help women, however, feel the downtrend in the number of cases doesn’t mean atrocities against married women have reduced. Activists: Registration process delayed “The cases have reduced because women who come with complaints are being tired out due to police delaying the registration of cases. The Supreme Court has relaxed the law without it being amended. The relaxation is being misused by police, who want to do away with registering many cases,” claimed KS Vimala of Janawadi Mahila Sanghatane. However, legal practitioners say unlike earlier, police try to mediate in domestic discord cases and succeed in sending back aggrieved women without registering their complaints. Ambika S, an advocate dealing with dowry harassment cases, said, “Following Supreme Court guidelines, police take stock of the situation before deciding whether to register a domestic violence or dowry harassment case. Complainants who don’t have enough evidence are being sent back. In other cases, police, in good faith, try to reconcile the fighting couple.” Ambika said the dowry menace is still rampant but has acquired different forms like demands for cars, land or even a government job. Activists fighting for men’s rights have welcomed the decline but said women may use other criminal sections like rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act to seek vengeance against their husbands and in-laws. Kumar Jagirdar, a city-based activist for men’s rights, said, “Many dowry cases are to do with vengeance. Realizing that the section is being misused, the Supreme Court laid down guidelines directing police not to act hastily on complaints. But there are instances of women wanting a police case against their husbands and falsely accusing them of sexually assaulting or raping their minor daughter.” ",06 Mar 2019,2019-03-06 00:00:00
Violence erupts after Shah rally in Bengal,Violence erupts after Shah rally in Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/violence-erupts-after-shah-rally-in-bengal/articleshow/67748257.cms,en,"CONTAI: BJP national president Amit Shah launched a scathing attack on “dynastic politics” in Delhi and Bengal from a rally in East Midnapore district’s Contai town on Tuesday that soon led to clashes between Trinamool and BJP supporters in which a TMC office was ransacked, vehicles ferrying BJP workers were set on fire and policemen were attacked. Three persons were injured in the violence that erupted just minutes after Shah left the stage. A bike that was parked in front of a petrol pump — barely 100 meters away from the rally ground — was set on fire. Union home minister Rajnath Singh has sought a report on the violence from the state government. “When the UPA ruled for 10 years, there were 2Gs — Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. During the 2G regime, there were scams worth Rs 12 lakh crore. Now, Priyanka Gandhi has joined to make it 3G. They have continued with the dynastic politics since Jawaharlal Nehru’s days. It is the same in West Bengal where Mamata-ji and her nephew are running dynastic politics,” said Shah. Terming both parties as two sides of the same coin, Shah said the time has come to “root out dynastic politics from the country”. Shah alleged that the Rs 4-lakh crore the Centre had sent to Bengal for different schemes did not reach the poor. Syndicates have siphoned off the money the Centre had sent to the states. Many villages are yet to receive uninterrupted power supply,” he said. Shah harped on poverty in Bengal in the same vein, claiming that one in every five persons in the state is still living below poverty line. Raking up corruption issues during the UPA regime, Shah said: “The country needs a government ruled by leaders and not by dealers.” Taking a dig at the sales of paintings by chief minister Mamata Banerjee , Shah alleged that her paintings were bought by the ponzi firm owners. “How much do you think a painting can fetch? Thousands or lakhs may be. But Mamataji's paintings were sold for crores. All such paintings were bought by chit fund walas,” he said. He alleged that the ponzi firm owners who bought the paintings enjoyed immunity in the state. Blaming the Bengal government for renaming centrally-sponsored schemes and trying to take credit, the BJP president said, “The Centre sends the money for the Rs 2/kg rice that the poor people receive. Now, they are even depriving people by denying them healthcare facilities under centrally-sponsored schemes.” “Before the elections (Assembly polls), TMC had promised to reopen 55,000 closed factories in the state. How many of them have been reopened? Instead, bomb-making units have mushroomed across the state,” he said. Pointing at the “growing infiltration” in Bengal, Shah said Trinamool must clarify its position on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. “If voted to power, we will make arrangements for refugees (Hindu refugees) in the state,” he added. Claiming that BJP will win at least 23 Lok Sabha seats from Bengal, Shah said people were waiting for change. “If voted to power, we will take Bengal back to its old glory and create a Sonar Bangla under Narendra Modi’s leadership.” Slamming the Ponzi muddle in the state, Shah said Ponzi firms have looted at least 25 lakh poor investors. “We will return the money to the poor investors,” Shah said. Reacting to the clashes, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “When our supporters were returning from the rally, they were attacked by TMC activists. This is a shame. We condemn it.” Trinammol’s retort came quick. “BJP workers attacked our party offices and this led to retaliation by our workers. If our party office is attacked, are we going to offer sweets?” Suvendu, also the state transport minister, said. He alleged that BJP was trying to disturb peace and stability in the district.

At 1 or 2am, our restaurant is often full of guests who are under the influence of alcohol. They threaten us by citing personal connections saying things like, ‘Tu janta nahi mai kaun hoon’, when we ask them for payments. However, our staff is equipped to deal with such situations,” he shares. Eateries at Sindhi Camp that stay open till late at night ‘WE DEPLOY BOUNCERS AND SECURITY GUARDS TO HANDLE SUCH SITUATIONS’ DND Bar and Lounge, situated on the rooftop of Hotel Maharani Prime, Sindhi Camp, is a well-known place where Jaipur’s youngsters, many of them having consumed alcohol, congregate to have food and an after-party of sorts. The place stays open till 6 in the morning. Owner Naveen Bacchani says, “Alcohol is often a key factor in the aggressive behaviour of guests. Not just with our staff, sometimes a violent brawl occurs among the guests themselves. Under the influence of alcohol, it takes no time for a usual verbal spat to escalate into a violent scuffle. On our part, we have installed CCTV cameras at our lounge and have deployed three bouncers and two security guards to tackle this growing problem. When the situation gets out of control, we call the police.” Naveen adds, “We also have some guests who refuse to pay the bill. Recently, we had a customer who came with one of his female friends late at night and both of them ordered drinks. While the female guest left early, the man stayed on for a while and placed an order for some more drinks and snacks. When we asked him for payment, he simply refused and became a bit aggressive with our staff. We had to take the help of the police in this case. We have a zero-tolerance approach towards people who don’t know how to behave.” He further informs that such problems happen mostly at roadside food outlets as compared to rooftops. ‘ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS POINTED A GUN AT ME’ Rajesh, owner of an eatery which is open till 6am at Sindhi Camp, shares, “There was an incident when one of the customers pointed a gun at me. Problems arise, especially during the weekend when there is a lot of rush. I have noticed that it is mostly the outstation people, settled in Jaipur either for studies or work, who often create troubles and misbehave with us. They live away from their parents. So, they think that they are free to do whatever they want.” He further adds, “I think police patrolling at regular intervals might help in curbing the situation. Even though my staff is trained in crowd management, they are not security.” ‘CUSTOMERS HAVE PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED DELIVERY BOYS’ Sabir Khan, help desk manager at Muhammadi Palace that stays open till 12-12.30am, says that it is mostly the young boys who misbehave. Also, incidents of violence are not just limited to the restaurant staff. It happens with the delivery boys as well. “We have had incidents where customers have literally snatched food from our delivery boys to avoid paying the money and physically assaulted them. According to our delivery boys, such customers are mostly drunk. At our restaurant, people under the influence of alcohol come and leave without paying the bill. When we try to stop them, they try to do dadagiri. We don’t go to the police because it is quite a hassle and might bring bad reputation to the restaurant. But violence at food outlets is definitely a matter of concern,” he says. ",02 Mar 2019,2019-03-02 00:00:00

After all, the village was the first in the district to witness a Maoist attack in 2009. Threats of rebels forced the villagers to refrain from voting and meeting candidates during campaigning. But it is no more so. A decade later, they are ready to vote as politicians make the last ditch efforts to meet the electorate with campaigning for the first phase ending on Tuesday. “After the election notification this year, we were fearful that we would upset the Maoists if we met the politicians because in 2014 they had asked us not to vote. As days passed, political leaders kept coming to our village and we met them,” said Khyamasagar Barik, 35, a villager, who had witnessed the Maoist violence. The village comes under Nuapada assembly segment, which has around two lakh voters. Supporters of BJD assembly nominee Rajendra Dholakia are moving door-to-door seeking votes. “Dholakia himself came here once and visited all villages located atop the Sunabeda forest. We don’t feel any threat like we faced in the 2014 elections when Maoists had dissuaded us from voting. We encouraged the aspirants to visit our village so that we can hear their promises,” said former sarpanch of Sunabeda Tulsi Majhi, 55. Politicians are mustering courage to visit the village that comes under Kalahandi Lok Sabha segment. “The only reason we were ready to vote and meet the contestants is that we would be able to place our complaints before them. We have only one tubewell in the village and we draw water from it by a solar-powered pump . We need another such facility,” said another villager Bidhan Barik. The change was gradual with villagers realising that Maoists are not their friends with the murders of suspected police informers. Residents of this village, 60 km from the district headquarters of Nuapada, also felt participating in the electoral process would ensure development of their village. Now the forest personnel also do their duties fearlessly even as the forest section office destroyed by rebels in 2009 is still in a dilapidated state. Cherechua forester Sibanarayan Majhi, who stays the night in his small rest house in the village on the forest office premises, said villagers have changed a lot. “The ambience of the village has changed. People are talking about their democratic rights. The villagers are also staying away from Maoist influence and no more providing them shelter. This has made our job easy,” he said.

The tally at the end of voting by way of secret ballot on Monday was 22-11 against Singh in a 35-member body, whose present strength is 34 following the death of a councillor. The sole Left councillor didn’t turn up for voting. Trinamool councillors had served the no-confidence notice on the chairman soon after Arjun Singh defected to BJP from Trinamool. Municipality vice-chairman Somenath Talukdar said councillors will elect the new chairman within a fortnight. “As many as 19 councillors were with Trinamool from the very beginning. They had openly affirmed their support for Mamata Banerjee on March 17 in presence of Trinamool candidate Dinesh Trivedi ,” Talukdar said. The result had an immediate impact. A Trinamool gang pulled down the BJP party office at Atpur and set it on fire. This came three weeks after a Trinamool office at Ward 9 was taken over and given a coat of saffron on March 14. Violence spread to Naihati after BJP unit president Falguni Patra was attacked. Bhatpara residents stayed indoors all through Monday, fearing violence. There was tight security arrangement in the area since morning with the police clamping Section 144 in the area. A large contingent of police including RAF and Combat force were deployed. Trinamool’s Naihati MLA Partha Bhowmick believes that Singh’s defeat is bound to affect the outcome of the Barrackpore Lok Sabha polls. Singh, however, looked unfazed. “Councillors had come under threat from the ruling party. The election of the new chairman will be held after the Lok Sabha polls. I will now go to the people’s court and win the polls. After that I believe that councillors will elect me as the new chairman of Bhatpara,” he said. Singh’s defeat has come as the shot in the arm for Trinamool North 24 Parganas president and food minister Jyotipriya Mullick. “Today the councillors have rejected him. People will also give him a rebuff,” Mullick said. ",09 Apr 2019,2019-04-09 00:00:00

Addressing his first Lok Sabha poll rally in Wardha, Modi said that Sharad Pawar had shied away from contesting the general elections this time after sensing which way the wind was blowing. He alleged that Pawar was also losing his grip over his own party. “The NCP is witnessing a family feud, and he is losing the party’s command to his bhatija (Ajit Pawar). There is a lot of infighting going on over distribution of tickets. Today he has been clean bowled by the people, and his nephew would soon get him out hit wicket from the NCP’s chair,” he said. Likening the erstwhile Congress-NCP alliance government to ‘Kumbhakarna’ from the Ramayana, Modi accused the two parties of involvement in scams. “They used to look out for sources of money and gobbled up crores in irrigation, stamps, roads, real estate and wherever possible. One of their leaders (Ajit Pawar) insulted farmers when questioned by a farmer on the lack of water in dams. His comments were so derogatory that I can’t utter them from the dais,” the PM said. Modi told the gathering that it was on the orders of Pawar that police had opened fire on farmers in Maval. “Pawar is himself an agriculturist and was agriculture minister for a decade. Yet farmer suicides hit an all-time high during his tenure,” he said, adding that it was because of the Cong-NCP’s misdeeds that a drought situation had been created in the Vidarbha region. He said the BJP-Shiv Sena government had taken up the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan in earnest to help resolve the water crises in the state. Modi alleged that the Congress-NCP government had also allowed rioters to run amok at Azad Maidan in Mumbai during its tenure and not brought to book those who had damaged the martyrs’ memorial there. The PM started his speech in Marathi in front of the nearly 60,000-strong crowd and paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave. While Gandhi stayed in Bapu Kuti in Sewagram for a long time, Bhave had made Paunar, near Wardha, his home. Wardha is one of seven LS seats in Maharashtra which go to the polls in the first phase of the elections on April 11. BJP’s Ramdas Tadas is seeking re-election from Wardha. He is up against the Congress’s Charulata Tokas, who is daughter of former state party chief Prabha Rao. Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Ramdas Athawale and CM Devendra Fadnavis were present at the rally. ",01 Apr 2019,2019-04-01 00:00:00

CPM never supports violence: Kerala CM,CPM never supports violence: Kerala CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cpm-never-supports-violence-kerala-cm/articleshow/68063495.cms,en,"THIRUVANTHAPURAM: Stating that the CPM never promoted violence, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday asserted that it had no role in the recent killings of two Youth Congress activists in Kasaragod , even as the Left party demanded a CBI probe into the incident. Talking to reporters at the secretariat here, he said the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had already directed the state police to take stringent action against the accused and bring them before law at the earliest. If any CPM activist was found to be involved in the crime, they would never get the party's backing, Vijayan said, adding that they would not only have to face legal action, but also stern party action. ""The CPM has never promoted violence. It is a party which had to face violence on several occasions and there was no need for it to conspire the murder of the Youth Congress workers,"" he said, replying to a reporter's question over the issue. ""At a time when the CPM is organising party yatras ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, will anyone with minimum political literacy indulge in such a crime?,"" Vijayan asked. The chief minister's remarks came at a time when the ruling party is facing the heat over the killings of Kripesh (24) and Sarath Lal (21), the Youth Congress activists who were waylaid and attacked while returning home after attending a function at Periya in Kasaragod on Sunday night. Opposition Congress and BJP have alleged that the killings were executed with the knowledge and support of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist). Meanwhile, state CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan reiterated on Tuesday that his party had no knowledge about the twin killings. ""Whoever be the accused, they should be brought before the law. We do not endorse the politics of killings,"" he said in Kollam. Rejecting the claims of Vijayan and Balakrishnan, state Youth Congress president Dean Kuriakose demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the gruesome incident. ""We do not trust the ongoing police investigation and demand a CBI probe into the killing of our activists,"" he said, adding that not only those who had executed the killings, but the conspirators should also be brought before law. Three Youth Congress workers had lost their lives in the last one year due to political rivalry, Kuriakose noted. Demanding a comprehensive and judicious probe, Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ramesh Chennithala visited Governor P Sathasivam at the Raj Bhavan here. The Congress leader later told reporters that the governor assured him that he would seek a report from the LDF government regarding the incident. Meanwhile, the police are continuing with the interrogation of those taken into custody in connection with the incident. Two persons were taken into custody on Monday. Two motorcycles, suspected to have been used by those responsible for the brutal attacks on the Youth Congress workers, were also seized. Normal life was affected and incidents of violence were reported from various places during a dawn-to-dusk hartal called by the Youth Congress in Kerala on Monday. ",19 Feb 2019,2019-02-19 00:00:00

Violence erupts after Shah rally in Contai,Violence erupts after Shah rally in Contai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/violence-erupts-after-shah-rally-in-contai/articleshow/67748111.cms,en,"Contai: Clashes broke out between Trinamool Congress and BJP supporters immediately after BJP national president Amit Shah addressed a packed rally in Contai on Tuesday in which he launched a scathing attack on dynastic politics in Delhi and Bengal. A local TMC office was ransacked, vehicles ferrying BJP workers were set on fire and cops attacked by workers of both parties. Home minister Rajnath Singh called CM Mamata Banerjee in the evening and sought a report on the violence. Banerjee, however, alleged that BJP supporters were resorting to violence and asked him to restrain them from indulging in hooliganism. Three persons were injured in the violence that erupted minutes after Shah left the stage. A bike parked in front of a petrol pump — barely 100m from the rally ground — was set on fire. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu claimed that over 200 party supporters were injured while the condition of at least 50 was serious. Trinamool claimed at least 12 of its workers were injured. “When UPA ruled for 10 years, there were 2Gs — Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. During the 2G regime, there were scams worth Rs 12 lakh crore. Now, Priyanka Gandhi has joined to make it 3G. They have continued with the dynastic politics since Jawaharlal Nehru’s days. It is the same in West Bengal, where Mamataji and her nephew are running dynastic politics,” said Shah. Terming both parties two sides of the same coin, Shah said the time had come to “root out dynastic politics from the country”. Shah’s jibe, incidentally, came in the Adhikari family backyard in Contai’s Padmapukuria, where BJP scripted a 23% rise in vote share in the 2017 Contai (South) assembly bypoll to emerge as the principal opposition, elbowing out Left Front and Congress, who together only managed an 11% vote share. The Contai Lok Sabha seat is held by Suvendu’s father Sishir, while the adjoining Tamluk Lok Sabha seat by his younger brother, Dibyendu. Shah claimed the Rs 4 lakh crore the Centre had sent to Bengal for different schemes did not reach the poor. “Syndicates have siphoned off the money the Centre had sent to the states. Many villages are yet to receive uninterrupted power su-pply,” he said. Shah also harped on poverty in Bengal, claiming that one in every five persons in the state was still living below poverty line. Raking up corruption issues during the UPA regime, Shah said: “The country needs a government ruled by leaders and not by dealers.” Blaming the Bengal government for renaming centrally-sponsored schemes and trying to take credit for them, he said: “The Centre sends the money for the Rs 2/kg rice that the poor receive. Now, they are even depriving people by denying them healthcare facilities under centrally-sponsored schemes.” “Before the elections (assembly polls), TMC had promised to reopen 55,000 closed factories in the state. How many have been reopened? Instead, bomb-making units have mushroomed across the state,” he said. Pointing at the “growing infiltration” in Bengal, Shah said Trinamool must clarify its position on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. “If voted to power, we will make arrangements for refugees (Hindu refugees) in the state,” he added. Claiming that BJP would win at least 23 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, Shah said people were waiting for change. “If voted to power, we will take Bengal back to its old glory and create a Sonar Bangla under Narendra Modi’s leadership.” Slamming the Ponzi muddle in the state, Shah said firms had looted at least 25 lakh poor investors. “We will return the money to the poor investors,” Shah said. Reacting to the clashes, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “When our supporters were returning from the rally, they were attacked by TMC activists. This is a shame. We condemn it.” Trinamool was quick to retort. “BJP workers attacked our party offices and this led to retaliation by our workers. If our party office is attacked, are we going to offer sweets?” Suvendu, also the state transport minister, said. He alleged that BJP was trying to disturb peace and stability in the district.

‘Shocking that women training to be nurses displayed such violence’,‘Shocking that women training to be nurses displayed such violence’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/shocking-that-women-training-to-be-nurses-displayed-such-violence/articleshow/67550116.cms,en,"KOLKATA: The two NRS Medical College nursing students accused of bludgeoning 16 puppies were likely to be suffering from a ‘severe personality disorder’ and needed immediate counselling, felt psychiatrists. Since such extreme behaviour indicated a high degree of disorder and was difficult to cure through treatment, the students should be kept under life-long monitoring, they advised. It was shocking that these youngsters were training to be nurses — a profession that requires compassion and kindness, said psychiatrist J Ram. “It was a case of planned, ruthless murder and their behaviour bordered on sadism. This shows that they have complete disregard for the well-being of animals around them. It raises questions about their feelings for fellow humans as well. They have no moral values either. It is ironical and indeed sad that they were going to become nurses,” said Ram. The condition that these nurses have is also known as ‘anti-social personality disorder’, added the psychiatrist. “Usually, these people have a long history of cruel behaviour. Often, there are enough indications but they are ignored. Such behaviour indicators start showing up in adolescence and remain dormant unless a situation arises that exposes the condition,” added Ram. Nurses’ organizations condemned the act and agreed that the accused needed treatment. “This is not normal behaviour and these youngsters should be put through counselling. But it must also be noted that these students were driven to despair by these stray dogs that had become a menace on campus. The students had lodged several complaints with the authorities but no step was taken,” said Parbati Pal of Nurses Unity. This violent behaviour was also a result of the endorsement of aggression and intolerance by the society at large, said psychiatrist Siladitya Ray. “While a section of the society has turned extremely conscious of animal rights and the need to protect endangered species, there is perhaps a growing section that remains intolerant towards animals. There is now a tendency to glorify aggression in entertainment and sports. The ruthlessness with which the puppies were killed is frightening. These offenders suffer from a serious personality disorder and should be put through counselling before being allowed to resume normal activities,” Ray said. “It is distressing but true that people who display such heartless behaviour towards animals would also be cruel towards humans. If these offenders were indeed nursing students, the authorities should consider if they are fit to join the profession,” he added. Sociologist Prashanta Roy said this macabre action showed that there was a deep-seated angst and pent-up frustration ready to overflow at the slightest trigger. “There are negative emotions in every human being and most of the time we try to control them with civil behaviour. It’s a kind of sophistication that we deliberately put on because we do not want to show our basic instincts to people. But there is a deep-seated angst building up inside each of us because of the turbulent times we are in,” said Roy. ",16 Jan 2019,2019-01-16 00:00:00

Keeping that in mind, the National Security Act has been invoked against them,"" District Magistrate Anuj Jha said. ""To maintain public order and amity, the three have been charged under the section 3 sub-section 3 of the NSA.

""Their acts have hurt the sentiments of Hindus in Mahav and Nayabans village after which the violence broke out in which people attacked the police with sticks and axe, among others, and Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was killed. This had disturbed public order and communal harmony,"" Jha said in a statement. The district magistrate further said that if the trio was released on bail, they might tamper with evidence or engage in cow slaughter again which will disrupt public order.

The government cited Patel’s “criminal antecedent” by listing 24 FIRs registered against him and submitted that he has led people to indulge in violence on several occasions in the past. It pointed out his statements that led to the filing of a sedition case against him. It also cited various statements made by him on political leaders and claimed that he has got scant regard for women. The government also placed photographs showing Patel’s presence in the mob in Visnagar on July 23, 2015, when BJP MLA Rishikesh Patel’s office was vandalized. Patel along with two others were convicted to two-year imprisonment in this case. To clear the legal hurdle to contest Lok Sabha elections, Patel has urged the HC to stay the conviction. His advocates submitted that the conviction is not likely to sustain as the prosecution failed to establish his presence when the mob turned violent and ransacked the MLA’s office. His presence was established in the mob, but he was not present during the violence. Patel’s advocates also argued that other accused persons were acquitted by the Visnagar sessions court on same set of evidence on which Patel was convicted. Only leaders were convicted in this case. The hearing lasted till the rising of the court on Wednesday evening and is likely to continue on Thursday. Patel approached the HC on March 8 for a stay on his conviction. Justice R P Dholaria recused himself from hearing this case. The government later sought adjournment on two occasions. This led Patel to complain that the government was resorting to delaying tactics so that the time for filing nominations gets over and he cannot contest in the election.

Jayaprakash, who inaugurated a one-day state level seminar on ‘Reservation Policies in Contemporary Times: Problems and Prospects’ organised by the political science department of the University of Mysore (UoM), said, “Reservation was a tool devised to bring about equality in society . People demanding Reservation must reflect on the moral and ethical dimensions of the problem.” Jayaprakash said that, while there was one section in the country that wanted to extend the benefits of Reservation, while there was another that wanted to put an end to the practice once and for all. “The claim that Reservation is restricted to people from a few castes is false, it is extended to vulnerable sections across the social spectrum including physically-challenged people, etc., based on the proportion of their population,” said Jayaprakash. Pointing to the Dalits continuing to be on the margins of society, Jayaprakash said, “This indicates the persistence of the caste system . Reservation must continue till there is caste.” Political scientist HM Rajashekar called caste a societal ‘malaise’. “Caste has been used by leaders for political mileage. Parties coming to power must focus on providing employment to youngsters,” he said. Special officer for Raichur University Muzaffar Asadi said that the caste system was more prevalent, and deeply entrenched in rural areas than it was in cities. “A Dalit is killed every hour in the country. There are many temples that Dalits are not allowed entry to, and they are banned from drawing water from wells. Reservation must continue till there is caste-related violence,” said Asadi.

Three others also fell victim to this online fraud. In another bizarre case, Preeti Singh, 38, employed with a bio-fertilizer firm, received an email on resignations of top executives, firm’s bankruptcy details and new products in the pipeline. Later, it was found that mail accounts of the honchos were hacked. These cases are a window to the sudden spurt in cybercrime in 2018 in the city even as violent crimes saw a drastic dip in comparison to 2017. In fact, cybercrime cases rose by 142% over the previous year, according to a police dossier. Also, number of cybercrime cases were less than violent incidents in 2017, but skyrocketed in 2018. In 2017, at least 864 cybercrime incidents, including phishing, card cloning, financial swindling via social networking sites and job-related frauds were reported in the city, but in 2018, cybercrime cases doubled to 2,085. On the other hand, violent crimes — dacoity, murder, rape, kidnapping and loot — accounted for 910 cases in 2017 and declined by 8% in 2018 to 842 incidents. Data shows the cybercrime case count was less than violent crimes in the city till 2017. But rise in digital transactions after demonetization in 2016 and the rapid spread in net connectivity triggered a surge in cybercrime last year. In 2016, cybercrime cases dipped by 40% against violent crimes Number of cybercrime cases rose from 728 in 2016 to 864 in 2017 and galloped to 2,085 in 2018. In contrast, violent crime cases declined from 1,222 in 2016 to 910 in 2017 and further dipped to 842 in 2018. An analysis shows cybercrime cases were 40% less than violent crimes, but the gap narrowed by 5% in 2017, but surged ahead by 142% in the last calendar year. SSP Lucknow Kalanidhi Naithani said after demonetisation, more people began using e-wallets and debit, credit cards and became targets. The addition of 30% new users in the digital medium in 2017 also led to increase in cybercrime, he said. Independent cyber expert Adarsh Dubey, however, says increase in connectivity is not the sole reason. “Police force is poorly equipped. They still depend on old techniques of tracing IP address, then sending it to social media firms for tracing miscreants through ‘dark web’. Policemen are still unaware of crypto currency, block chain frauds and more such cases will be reported, he said. ",09 Jan 2019,2019-01-09 00:00:00

However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has found that domestic and sexual violence against women (VAW) was rampant and it was causing several health issues,” said Shrinivas Gadappa, head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at GMCH. According to a data collected by the GMCH, an alarming 28% of women face domestic violence during pregnancy. The information was collected as part of the WHO programme on violence against women. The programme was launched at the hospital in 2016. GMCH Aurangabad was one of the two government hospitals in the state to implement the programme. The other hospital is GMCH Meraj. Subsequently, a programme was introduced under which specialist doctors and nurses were trained as master trainers in Mumbai. These master trainers in turn trained other health professionals in the departments of gynaecology, casualty and medicine on understanding warning signs. More than 300 nurses were trained in batches of 40. Associate professor, department of medicine, Anil Joshi, said that the programme helps the health professionals to be empathetic towards women patients so that they open up if they are undergoing physical abuse. “If patients come with complaints which do not match with organic findings, we find out if they are undergoing violence or are under stress and how can we tackle and make them aware of the provisions of the law,” Joshi said.

Bharadwaj, arrested in the case in August last year, has filed a bail application in the Bombay High Court. Her lawyer, senior advocate Yug Chaudhry, argued before the bench of Justice N W Sambre that these documents were not legally valid evidence. They were typed and not handwritten, did not bear signatures, and ""there is no way to verify their authenticity and source,"" he said. ""On the basis of such documents that were found on someone else's computer and that cannot pass the test of the Evidence Act, how can the police keep me (Bharadwaj) behind bars and label me a Maoist?,"" Chaudhry asked. Aruna Pai, representing the police, contended that they had ample evidence to prove Bharadwaj's links with Maoist organisations. She was ""part of a conspiracy"" and therefore, it did not matter that the documentary evidence was found not at her house but at a co-accused's house, Pai said. Bharadwaj was an office-bearer of organisations such as the Indian Association for People's Lawyers and the Persecuted Prisoners' Solidarity Society, which should be considered as incriminating evidence against her, the government lawyer said. The police had earlier contended that these were front organisations of Maoists. Chaudhry, however, pointed out that none of these organisations were declared as illegal or banned. Justice Sambre is likely to pass the order on Bharadwaj's bail plea on March 11. According to the police, speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017 led to violence near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial in Pune district the next day. The police have claimed that the conclave was funded by Maoists. ",28 Feb 2019,2019-02-28 00:00:00

Speaking after unveiling the plaque to mark the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Sree Narayana Guru Renaissance Cultural Complex here, he touched on the opening lines of guru’s ‘Anukamba Dashakam’ (10 Verses on Compassion), cautioning against inflicting slightest pain even to an ant. Pointing out that guru's ideals of equality and fraternity have reflected well in the Constitution, he said: “As we celebrate Renaissance values and the wisdom of our Constitution, we must look within to assess the strength of our own commitment. If we had imbibed the Constitution’s spirit, which requires us to abjure violence, we would never spill blood over political differences,” he said. “Let us not forget that in the past six decades, since our state was formed, we have been ruled by different governments. They had different political views but all of them dreamed about and worked hard for the state’s progress. The state is today enjoying the legacy handed down to us by many individuals, groups and ideologies, who worked for the society’s welfare,” he added. The progress that Kerala has achieved in terms of human development, especially in literacy, education and health, was the result of the Renaissance movement, which quickened the pace of social transformation, the governor added. “There were many social movements that brought the winds of change and all of them were led by leaders whose words and ideas encouraged people to think and to fight for human dignity. These social and religious leaders had willingly taken up the task of recreating a society, which Swamy Vivekananda had once criticized as a lunatic asylum,” Sathasivam said. Minister for culture, SC/ST and backward communities, A K Balan, minister for fisheries J Mercykutty Amma, mayor V Rajendra Babu, M Mukesh, MLA, district panchayat president C Radhamani, culture secretary Rani George, cultural director T R Sadasivan Nair and others attended the event.

Amid incidents of vandalism, Governor P Sathasivam briefed Union home minister Rajnath Singh about the law and order situation in the southern state. Raj Bhavan sources told PTI that the Governor, who is now in Chennai, briefed Singh about the situation over phone. Besides Kannur, Perambra in neighbouring Kozhikode , Malappuram and Adoor in Pathanamthitta, where the Ayyappa shrine is located, also witnessed a series of similar attacks and vandalism on Friday night and in the early hours Saturday. Bombs were hurled at several places, including at the houses of CPM MLA A N Shamseer in Madapeedikayil, BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member V Muraleedharan at Vadiyil Peedikia and former Kannur district secretary of CPM P Sasi at Thalassery in Kannur district past midnight, police said. No one was injured in the attacks. As police struggled to control the situation, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan lashed out at the RSS, saying the Sangh Parivar was trying to create fear in people's minds. The opposition Congress hit out, asking why the left government failed to stop the RSS from creating trouble. In another development, a peace meeting called by the Revenue Divisional Officer at Adoor in Pathanamthitta district was boycotted by the Bharatiya Janata Party. BJP claimed that they decided to stay away as the police failed to arrest the accused in connection with the death of Chandran Unnithan, a ' Sabarimala Karma Samiti' member who, they alleged, was killed in stone-pelting on January 3. Talking tough, Vijayan said ""State will deal with the RSS violence sternly. They are trying to destroy the peace and tranquility of the state. We will take stong action against it. It's the RSS agenda to create fear in the minds of the people,"" Vijayan told reporters here, adding that it will not be allowed. He said people of the state have shown restraint. ""The RSS workers were attacking houses of MLAs, and other leaders. Their only aim and route is violence. The law and order system of the state will take care of it,"" he said. Senior congress leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged the state police had failed to maintain law and order. ""DGP himself has accepted this. Why has government failed to stop the BJP from creating violence?"" Chennithala asked. State minister and CPM leader G Sudhakaran courted controversy calling Sabarimala temple's Tantri (chief priest), a ""Brahmin monster"" for conducting a 'purification' ceremony after two women in the menstrual age group entered the shrine. Two women, Kanakadurga (44) and Bindu (42), entered the shrine and offered prayers on Wednesday, breaking a centuries-old tradition. Following this, the tantri, Kandaru Rajeevaru, closed the sanctum sanctorum to perform the 'purification' ceremony. In Delhi, BJP national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao hit out at the CPM state leadership and said the violence around the hill shrine was unleashed by the LDF government, which, instead of dealing with it in a sensible way, wreaked havoc, resulting in devotees being hurt and even killed. Meanwhile, Pathanamthitta district collector has extended prohibitory orders at Sabarimla till 'Makaravilakku' festival on January 14. Prohibitory orders were already imposed at various places in the state including Nedumangadu, Adoor, Pandalam, and Kodumon. As violence erupted, V Muraleedharan's ancestral home was attacked hours after bombs were thrown at the homes of Shamseer and Sasi when leaders of the Marxist party and BJP-RSS were attending a peace meeting here. The attacks, which disrupted normal life, marked return of political violence on large-scale after a gap of over a year in the sensitive district. Kerala has been rocked by violent protests by BJP-RSS and right wing outfits after two women of menstruating age offered prayers at the Ayyappa temple on January 2. As violence continued to disrupt life in Kannur and other places, state police chief Loknath Behera sounded a state-wide alert and gave direction to take stern action against those responsible for attacks on houses of party leaders. According to Behara, 1,286 cases have been registered till tonight and 3,282 people arrested in connection with the violent incidents since the January 3 hartal called against the entry of two women into the hill temple. Of the arrested, 487 have been remanded and 2,795 granted bail. A police release said patrolling and raids had been intensified across Kannur. Police carried out a route march Saturday morning in Thalassery, where 19 people had been arrested and 33 taken into preventive custody. Police said stone pelting incidents were reported against a march taken out by DYFI and BJP office in Kannur district this evening, but none was injured. It has been decided that no marches would be allowed to be taken out tonight and tomorrow, according to police. In another incident, miscreants set an office of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) afire in Pariyaram area in the morning, police told PTI. A CPM worker was attacked at Perumbara in Iritty in the district last night while RSS leader K Chandrasekharan was assaulted in Thalassery and his house ransacked allegedly by around 25 Marxist workers. With the tension continuing, the CPM and BJP-RSS leaderships blamed each other for the violent attacks. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan told reporters in Thiruvananthapuram that the RSS was trying to trigger riot in the state and sabotage peace talks. The RSS-BJP combine was turning temples and educational institutions managed by them as ""armoury"", he alleged, adding the ruling party would take the initiative to restore peace in violence-hit areas. Countering the charges, V Muraleedharan said the incidents of violence were the tactics of the ruling CPM to divert attention from the controversies and protests over the violation of the traditional customs at the Sabarimala temple. The entry of two women into the hill shrine on Wednesday, the first time since the Supreme Court in September last year lifted the age-linked ban on the entry of women devotees, has triggered massive protests in Kerala. Located in north Kerala, Kannur has been the hotbed of political violence especially between the CPM and BJP and witnessed bloody clashes and killings over the years. In Kannur district, 169 cases have been registered and 230 people arrested, while in Palakkad 166 cases have been registered and 298 people held, police said.

Local RSS leaders indicated they are not keen to associate with a programme intended to give mileage to UDF candidate K Muraleedharan in his fight against CPM candidate P Jayarajan. The RMPI’s plan is to hold a conference of the families of the Congress worker Ariyil Shukkur and RSS leader Kathiroor Manoj along with other victims of the CPM violence. Jayarajan is an accused in the murder of Shukkur and Manoj. RMPI state secretary N Venu had told media persons that the party is thinking of a meeting of the victims of CPM violence. “We are against the kind of politics pursued by Jayarajan and would like to associate with any campaign against him. But this is not the time for such programmes. We do not wish to be part of a programme to promote Muraleedharan,” an RSS leader in Kannur said. “There are more crucial issues such as the return of the Modi government and the developments after the Sabarimala. Muraleedharan had taken a tough stand against Valsan Thillenkari and K Surendran who were in the forefront of the Sabarimala agitations,” he said. It is learnt that there is also a confusion in the RMPI also in joining hands with the BJP and the RSS. Many believe it will give credence to the CPM’s allegation that there is a secret understanding with the RMPI and the BJP in Vadakara. CPM district secretary P Mohanan said holding of the programme may not be entirely the idea of the RMPI. “The party could be organising the programme at the instance of the UDF,” he said. Mohanan said as many as 93 CPM workers have been murdered by the RSS, the Congress and the IUML in the areas coming under the Vadakara constituency. Jayarajan himself is the victim of the political violence but he is being branded as a murderer, he said. ",21 Mar 2019,2019-03-21 00:00:00

Her husband and children were not present there when she reached home. Kanakadurga told reporters that she was hopeful that the issues within the family would be resolved soon and she was happy with the verdict. She approached the court after she was denied entry to the house after she along with Kozhikode native Bindu Ammini, entered Sabarimala temple under police protection on January 2. Kanakadurga, 39, who hails from an orthodox Nair family in Areekode, had drawn the ire of her relatives for her act.

HC has sought this clarification after Dilawar Singh, one of the main accused in case of attack on Abhimanyu 's house, appeared before it seeking bail on the grounds that the trial court has failed to meet the deadline set by SC to complete the trial. “The CBI Court at Panchkula is directed to file latest status report of the trial explaining therein as to whether any application for extension of time was moved before apex court or not,” the HC has observed in its recent orders. The matter would now be heard on Tuesday. In his plea seeking bail, Dilawar has been arguing that as per the order dated May 1, 2018, passed by the SC, the CBI was directed to complete the investigation within a period of two months so as to commence the trial latest by July 10, 2018 and to conclude it by the end of 2018. He contended that investigation in the case has been completed and challan has also been presented but trial was not in progress. Seeking directions to release him on bail, Dilawar has also submitted that he was in custody for the past around three years. During February 2016 Jat violence , several persons had attacked and set on fire the ancestral house of Captain Abhimanyu and tried to burn all the family members living there.

"Year of violence, controversies and mine tragedy for Meghalaya","Year of violence, controversies and mine tragedy for Meghalaya",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shillong/year-of-violence-controversies-and-mine-tragedy-for-meghalaya/articleshow/67331543.cms,en,"SHILLONG: Meghalaya , which is also known as the 'Abode of Clouds', had a tumultous 2018 as the state kept hogging the limelight for a number of issues that made news nationally. From coal mafia attacking RTI activist Agnes Khasiingh, Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) passing a bill depriving Khasi women of ST status if they marry non-tribals, an HC judge saying that India should have been declared a Hindu partition during Parition, Punjabi Lane clashes to 15 miners getting trapped in a flooded coal mine, the state has seen it all. Though the year started on a promising note with the youthful Conrad Kongkal Sangma taking over the reins from Mukul Sangma, the state first witnessed violence and then got entangled in controversies one after another as the year passed by. Punjabi Lane clashes In June, clashes erupted when a bus driver and his friend were attacked in the Punjabi Lane area of Shillong following an altercation with some residents of the area. As rumours of the assaulted victims dying in hospital spread on the social media, locals grouped together and went to attack the residents following which the entire area was put under curfew for over a month. Inter-city transport between Guwahati and Shillong was hit and internet services were also suspended to prevent futher escalation of the situation. Because of the curfew prices of essential commodities had skyrocketed, causing inconvenience to people. Earlier this week, the Pubjab cabinet had approved a proposal for providing Rs 60 lakh as compensation to the Sikh community against damage caused to their properties during violence in Shillong. But the Meghalaya government was unhappy with the decision saying that it would 'add more fuel to the fire' as the state government is trying to solve the issues amicably. RTI Activist Attacked RTI activist Agnes Kharshiing and her aide, Amita Sangma, were critically injured after they were attacked by a group of 30-40 people, led by suspected coal mafia, at Shohshrieh village in East Jaintial Hills district on November 8. The incident took place after the duo stopped by to take pictures of coal-laden trucks on the roadside. She had suffered five wounds in her head, a broken arm and was kept in hospital for two weeks. The state government paid for the medical expenses of both the activists following a high court order. Recently, the prime accused in the case, Nidamon Chullet, surrendered before the police in East Jaintia Hills district. Chullet is a leader of the ruling National People's Party. Another accused, identified as Cheerful K Ryngkhlem, has also surrendered. Earlier, police had arrested six persons in connection with the attack. Khasi Marriage Bill The Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) in July approved a bill that will debar a Khasi woman from Scheduled Tribe (ST) status and other privileges if she marries a non-Khasi. Describing the legislation as 'insensitive', Meghalaya state women's commission chairperson Theilin Phanbuh had said the KHADC should have arranged for a public debate on the issue before tabling the bill. ""The bill portrays a gender bias as as it talks only about women and chooses to remain silent about men who choose to marry a non-tribal woman."" Meghalaya is divided into three autonomous councils - Khasi, Jaintia and Garo. The anti-mixed marriage legislation will be applicable in the three districts of West Khasi Hills district, East Khasi Hills district and Ri-Bhoi districts. Hindu nation row A judge of the Meghalaya high court recently sparked a controversy by saying that India should have declared itself a Hindu nation at the time of of the Partition. Justice SR Sen made this observation while disposing of a petition of one Amon Rana, who was denied domicile certificate by the state government. ""Pakistan declared themselves as an Islamic country and India, since (it) was divided on the basis of religion, should have also been declared as a Hindu country, but it remained as a country,"" Justice Sen said. Justice Sen, who is the lone judge at the Meghalaya HC, said ""I make it clear that nobody should try to make India as Islamic country, otherwise it will be a doom's day for India and the world. I am confident that only this government under PM Narendra Modi will understand the gravity, and will do the needful as requested above and our (West Bengal) chief minister Mamata Banerjee will suport the national interest in all respect."" Justice Sen has clarified that he never meant to challenge the country's secularism. ""Whatever is the truth, history and ground reality, on that basis I have written my judgment to save the citizens of India irrespective of caste, creed, religion or language and people should understand the history of India and live in peace and harmony."" He added, ""Secularism is one of the basic structures of our Constitution. It should not further be divided on the basis of religion, caste, creed, community or language... I would also like to clarify here that in my judgment, nowhere I have said anything against secularism and my judgment makes references to the history and one cannot change the history,"" he clarified. Justice Sen had also urged the Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers to introduce a law to grant unconditional citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhist, Parsis, Christians, Khasis, Jaintias and Garos from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan seeking refuge in India. ""I would like to make it clear that when I mentioned the government under Shri Narendra Modiji, it is inclusive of the Hon'ble ministers and Hon'ble members of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,"" Justice Sen stated. ""I also mention here that I do not belong to any political party nor have I got any dream to get any political berth after my retirement and neither is my judgment politically motivated or influenced by any part,"" he added. Clarifying his observation that Hindus and Sikhs were victims of Partition, he said, ""Their presence in India is primarily due to the religious persecution that they have been facing through generations and nobody can deny that... We should remember that whatever we call influx or foreigner, that is due to Partition without proper referendum and wrong boundary demarcation and mainly on religious persecution."" As for his suggestion on extension of unconditional citizenship to minorities from neighbouring countries, he said, ""It is not uncommon to find people living in India for generations and yet having no proper documentation. It would be inhumane to uproot them and displace them once again."" Mine Tragedy Fifteen miners are trapped inside a 370-foot-deep illegal coal mine in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills district since December 13 after water from a nearby river gushed in, puncturing the mine wall. Indian Navy divers on Monday entered the flooded mine and said the search would be feasible only after the water level inside the shaft is reduced to a safe diving limit of 30 metres. On the 18th day of the operation, the Navy divers stayed inside the shaft for three hours with a hi-tech gadget, Under Water Remotely Operated Vehicle, and found visibility to be very poor - only one foot. According to the Navy, all precautions are being taken to ensure that divers do not suffer from decompression sickness, which is usually experienced in a compressed environment as that of the mine in Lumthari village. National Disaster Response Force , Air Force, Coal India Limited, Odisha Fire Services and some other agencies are assisting in rescue work. ",02 Jan 2019,2019-01-02 00:00:00

He also urged the advocates to remain rooted in rationality and critical thinking. ""To fight the divisive ideas aggressively propagated nowadays, one needs to be rooted in rationality and critical thinking, of which the cardinal rule is to never accept any idea or proposition at face value, but to determine its validity by criticizing and questioning it,"" he said.

Addressing a massive rally at Kozhikode beach on Thursday, Rahul slammed demonetisation and GST, and targeted prime minister Narendra Modi for weakening major institutions in the country, including the Supreme Court and election commission. ""The man who imposes his Mann Ki Baat on India is attacking all our institutions one after the other,"" the Congress president said. Though Congress is trying to work out 'tactical adjustments' with CPM in Bengal, Rahul refused to spare the Left party in Kerala , saying that the only thing CPM is capable of is violence and that its ideology was ""deformed"".

Those who did it to them would face justice.” Emphasizing ‘justice’, he said, “The Congress party is not going to allow anybody to get away from justice. It doesn’t matter even if he is the Prime Minister of India”. Pointing out that he was happy to come to a state where people of different ideas and religions live together happily, he said an “ideological battle” was being played out in the country today. “Congress does not want to impose anything on India... The Congress party wants to listen to what people have to say and act accordingly”, the Congress president said. ",15 Mar 2019,2019-03-15 00:00:00

Nat was identified as the SHO’s ""killer"" after he was allegedly seen shooting Singh in one of the videos of the incident. He was arrested on December 27 last year. Police had then claimed that Nat has confessed to shooting the inspector. “SHO Singh’s CUG (closed user group) phone along with five other mobile phones were recovered from the residence of Prashant Nat. The recovery was made after a tip-off from a source following which warrant was secured from the local court and searches were conducted on Saturday night,” Atul Kumar Srivastava, Bulandshahr superintendent of police (city), said on Sunday. Officials claim that the recovery will help the investigating agencies tighten the noose on Nat and others who have been directly linked to the murder of the SHO. Police are yet to trace owners of other five mobile phones recovered from his house. “We had taken Nat on remand to recover his clothes which he wore at the time of the incident. The clothes he had abandoned at his home were sent to us at the police station by his family members.

The integrated centre proposed by the state government will offer services including medical aid, police assistance, legal aid and case management, psychosocial counselling and temporary support services to women affected by violence. The centre started functioning two weeks ago at Pandeshwar. The one-stop service centre was announced in the 2018-19 budget, which aimed at upgrading the existing women’s police station. T R Suresh, city police commissioner , Mangaluru, speaking to STOI, said that any women victim under the city commissionerate can come forward and lodge a complaint at this centre. All the facilities will be provided free of cost. It is now temporarily working at the women’s police station and there are plans to shift to an independent building. Suresh said they have identified two places for construction of the One Stop Service Centre . “One place identified is adjacent to the current Women’s police station and another near the RTO office. Once we finalise one of the places, the work will begin,” he added. Currently, all the staff at the new centre are functioning ‘on call’ basis. “Soon, the process of hiring new staff on contractual basis for the centre will be initiated,” said Suresh. Explaining facilities provided at the centre, Suresh said that women victims will get all sorts of help starting from police, legal, medical as well as counselling. The place will also have restrooms for the victims, and will be managed by women police staff. “When a woman survives a sexual assault, she has to go to various places like for conducting medical examination, counselling and other legal procedures. It is an added agony for victims, who is already devastated by the crime committed against her. The centre will give relief to the woman by not having to go to many places, by having all such facilities under one roof” said a senior police officer. Kalavathi, inspector at the women’s police station, said major complaints at the station include issues related to family, fights between couples, dowry harassment and others. Most of these issues are settled amicably after counselling. ",09 Feb 2019,2019-02-09 00:00:00

The accused, Mohammad Shaqeel, have been booked for voluntarily causing hurt. Shaqeel is unemployed and lives in Nai Abadi village of Dadri area along with his wife Pappi (40) and three children after being married for the past 25 years. Police said he was alcoholic and used up most of the money his wife earned as a domestic help in the village on liquor. On Tuesday evening, Shaqeel allegedly attacked his wife with a knife and cut her earlobes after she refused to give him money to buy liquor. The woman was taken to a hospital, where the wounds were bandaged. Pappi was then taken to the police station to lodge a written complaint against her husband. “He has been physically assaulting me for years every time he is drunk. For years, he has been snatching money from me to buy drinks. On Tuesday, however, I refused to give any more money because he was already drunk. He became angry and attacked me with a knife. He cut my earlobes as punishment for rejecting his demand for more money,” the woman wrote in her complaint. Ram Sen Singh, the SHO of Dadri police station, said it was not clear if the woman’s earlobes had been cut with a knife. “The man is jobless and addicted to liquor. It appears he had pulled the ears with his nails, causing a blood injury. The use of knife is not confirmed yet,” said Singh. Shaqeel has been booked under Section 323 of the Indian Penal code for voluntarily causing hurt. “A raid of the house was conducted after the complaint was received but the accused was not found anywhere. He will be arrested soon,” Singh said. ",22 Jan 2019,2019-01-22 00:00:00

The movement then spread across the world against war and violence. Now, Karnataka Rajya Mahila Dourjanya Virodhi Okkuta (KRMDVO), a women’s organization has launched a similar campaign against violence on women, in Dharwad district . Speaking to TOI, Sharada Dabade, convener, KRMDO, said Vimochana had started the movement in Bengaluru a few years ago. “Now we have initiated the movement in Dharwad district where we are holding state level International Women’s Day programme on March 8 and 9. Okkuta, which was floated after Nirbhaya case in 2013, has conducted similar conventions in Mangaluru, Mysuru, Bengaluru, Vijayapura, Koppal and Shivamogga since the past six years, where we hold state level conventions on the eve of Women’s Day,”she said. “Now we are taking the movement to small towns like Navalgund, Alnavar , Kalghtagi and Kundagol. We have roped in anganwadi workers, mid-day meals workers, Asha workers, pourakarmikas, garment factory workers, college students and women of various walks of life,” she added. Vani Periodi, another organizer said, “Black is the colour to express resistance. Silence is the language to voice our anguish. During the rally we stand at the main circles in the towns from 6pm to 7pm holding traditional lamps in our hands. It is a peaceful way to create awareness among both men and women to eradicate violence on women,” she added. Rajani Garud, a volunteer, said another Women in Black rally will be held on International Women’s Day on March 8 at the Jubilee Circle in Dharwad at 6pm. Convention in Dharwad from tomorrow Shankaragouda Satmar, one of organizers of the convention, said on Wednesday that many resource persons like activists Manimala and Amarjit Kaur from Delhi, thinker Lata Pratibha Madhukar from Hyderabd and others will participate in the meet.

Women in black will take out a silent rally at Jubilee Circle at 7pm to register their resistance against violence on women,” he added. Veteran poet Hema Pattanshetti said a rally and convention will be held at Kadapa Maidan at 9.30am on Saturday. Theatre personality Rajani Garud said, ""From its inception till date around 160 organisations have gathered under the Okkuta’s umbrella. People who subscribe to democratic social values like equality, social justice and those who are pro-life can be part of the Okkuta. This network has been organising International Women's Day events since 2013,” she said. Basavaraj Sulibhavi , another organizer, said the Okkuta was raising the Rs10 lakh needed for the convention by not seeking funds from the government, corporate companies but by selling hand kerchiefs and other campaign material of the event.

Video of mob violence against cow ‘thief’ viral,Video of mob violence against cow ‘thief’ viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/video-of-mob-violence-against-cow-thief-viral/articleshow/67373100.cms,en,"Jaipur/Alwar: A video clip of the recent mob violence in Alwar that went viral on Thursday shows an injured and visibly terrified Sagir Khan (23), sitting half-naked in biting cold on Sunday early morning, being forced to admit he was a “cow smuggler”. Khan is seen in the video with bruises on his face and blood gushing out of his lips and nostrils. In a Kangaroo court-like situation, he is made to answer questions about his home and identity. As the 2.16 minute video progresses, a cacophony of voices is heard in the background with the alleged perpetrators calling Khan a terrorist “deserving of a befitting treatment”. As the mobile camera shifts to Khan’s pick-up van, six cows are seen tied in it. “Aap sabhi se niveden hai ki Gau mata ko jyada se jyada bachao, yeh bhaisab (Khan) se baat karwata hun,” the accused shooting the video is heard while Khan, trembling in fear and cold struggled to speak. The video came to fore recently following the arrest of five accused, three of whom were later released on bail. The incident occurred on Sunday when Khan and his friend Mushtaq were ferrying cows from Jaipur’s Shahpura to in Haryana. Khan in his statement to police “claimed” he was ferrying cows for slaughter. A criminal case was also registered against him under multiple sections of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995. A resident of Mirzapur in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district, Khan sustained injures but survived the frenzied mob’s wrath. While police are investigating the matter, the mob-justice menace continues without any immediate solution. The menace’s epicenter remains Alwar where such videos are shot and shared widely, encouraging others to take “resolute action” against cow smugglers. Since April 1, 2017, at least 15 such cases have been recorded, including the lynching of Pehlu Khan. On December 6, 2017, Rajsamand police had to block internet services after an accused identified as Shambhu Lal Raiger hacked a migrant laborer to death and recorded a video, which was watched by many who hailed him as a hero.

Teltumbe, who was in Thrissur to deliver a lecture in memory of the former chief minister and veteran CPI leader C Achutha Menon, said he was informed by his counsel that the Pune sessions court has dismissed his anticipatory bail plea on Friday. ""The sessions court order was along the expected lines. But we had to go through that process as we cannot directly approach the high court,"" he said. Earlier, when the Supreme Court dismissed his plea to quash the FIR against, the apex court had said that he can approach a competent court for bail. Several activist-intellectuals including Telugu poet Varavara Rao, civil rights lawyers Sudha Bhardwaj, Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves, and Delhi-based journalist Gautam Navlakha were arrested in connection with the violence at Bhima Koregaon. The violence began with the annual event organised by the Dalits to commemorate the victory of the lower-caste Mahar group, over upper-caste led Maratha empire in 1818. The police allege that the Maoist groups were behind the violence, while the activists allege the groups associated with the Sangh Parivar had engineered the attacks. ""The case against me was completely fabricated and I have documentary proof to establish this. The letters which were allegedly written by me and seized by the police were all forged. The police could not recover any documents from my house,"" Teltumbde argued. He said the case against the activists were typical example of the rulers trying to silence the dissenters by describing them as ""Maoists."" Teltumde said if the BJP returns to power in the next Parliament elections, through their known strategy of dividing the opposition, it will be the end of India. Teltumde said the forces which are opposed to the BJP including the Left should unite to avert such a possibility. He said all the institutions like the police, CBI, CAG, national crime records bureau, judiciary and even the army are being undermined and are being used to push the interests of the ruling regime. Now, the latest report is that even the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) which had built up some credibility over the years, is being subjugated.

The order was passed by the court after examining the record of other persons who have been permitted to avail the facility inside the jail by the jail administration. The HC, however, has imposed certain conditions for Honeypreet to avail the facility. The socially adopted daughter of Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim had approached the HC against the decision of jail department Haryana in this regard. Honeypreet is lodged in Ambala jail since October 3, 2017 in connection with her role in the Panchkula violence and related cases. According to Honeypreet, in view of various jail reforms, prison inmate calling system (PICS) facility was introduced throughout the country and the same was also introduced in Haryana. As per the system, every prisoner lodged in the prison is allowed to hold telephonic conversation with his family members, friends, and relatives for five minutes every day. Appearing for Honeypreet, advocate Vinod Ghai had argued that the director general of prisons had issued directions for providing the PICS facility after verification of phone numbers provided by the prisoners. ""The phone numbers provided by the prisoners are verified and thereafter this facility is provided for making calls only on the verified numbers. The records of the said calls are also stored by the authorities,"" Ghai had argued seeking directions to allow the same facility to Honeypreet. The Haryana government, however, had strongly objected to her petition. The jail authorities had claimed that they received recommendations from the superintendent of police (SP) Sirsa that PICS facility should not be granted to Honeypreet as 20 criminal cases are registered in relation to the dera violence and a number of accused are yet to be arrested. It was also submitted that report from the police had revealed that there are chances of violence if Honeypreet is allowed to avail PICS. The jail superintendent had also submitted that the PICS facility to family of jail inmates is a facility and not a rule to right, thus the use of this facility to Honeypreet has rightly been rejected.

Police on Monday informed the Punjab and Haryana high court of the decision in reply to a notice the court served to Haryana government in November last year. The notice came after Honeypreet filed a plea against the October 29 decision of the jail department declining her application seeking the PICS facility. Honeypreet has been in Ambala jail since October 3, 2017, after she was arrested in connection with the Panchkula violence in August 2017 - which claimed at least 32 lives - and other related cases. Ambala Central Jail superintendent Lakhbir Singh told HC that they had sent some phone numbers to Sirsa Police after Honeypreet filed her PICS request. The Sirsa SP recommended rejecting her request. Lakhbir Singh added that PICS is a facility and not a rule, which has been rightly rejected in Honeypreet's case. ",14 Jan 2019,2019-01-14 00:00:00

Veeru, his wife Sunita and son Akash had been stabbed a day earlier. While Sunita succumbed to her wounds on Wednesday evening, Veeru lost the battle for life early Thursday morning. Their son Akash is still holding on to life but barely. Deputy Commissioner of Police (west) Monika Bhardwaj said the assailant Mohammad Azad was tracked down to Karampura Industrial Area on Thursday morning and arrested. This happened after Sunita and Veeru’s eight-year-old daughter, Lado, and 12-year-old son, Aman, told the police all that transpired on Wednesday between their family and Azad. “My mother was to come home with some sweets but uncle (Azad) attacked her with a knife,” recalled Lado while still wondering where her parents were. She is an eyewitness. Lado said Azad was standing at the corner of their street where he elbowed her mother Sunita. That led to an altercation. She said Azad would often threaten them from his balcony. “He abused my mother following which Akash went outside. My mother asked me to get her cellphone so that she could call up the police. Hearing this, he went inside his house and returned with a knife and attacked my mother and brother,” Lado said. Sonia, a neighbour of the family, said four other neighbours who tried to intervene were threatened by Azad. “He first stabbed Akash in the stomach. He tried to evade him by running out of the lane but fell on a cart. When Sunita tried to confront him, Azad slashed her throat. My sister-in-law tried to intervene but he was seething with rage and tried to attack her as well. Later, Veeru came out and Azad stabbed him multiple times before walking away,” said Sonia. She added that she closed the door to save herself, but came out again when she heard Veeru’s cries. He had been stabbed in the stomach and abdomen several times, and he was asking for water as he lay in a pool of blood. Lado’s elder brother, Aman, said his elder sister Khushboo (18) is six months’ pregnant and shut herself in the house to stay alive. The boy recalled that Azad had been threatening his whole family for the past few months after a soft drink bottle had accidentally fallen near his house. “Lado dropped the bottle accidentally, but it fell near Azad. There was an argument after that. Since then, he would openly threaten us and even stare at us through his balcony,” Aman said. Neighbours also echoed the family’s views, stating that Azad was short-tempered and would frequently get into arguments. On Wednesday night, there were two wedding celebrations in the lane and the loud music suppressed the noise of the argument. After the attack, Azad walked to the industrial area where he worked as a mechanic with the knife still in his hand and tried to hide at a few workshops. He also contacted a few co-workers to help him. Then he decided to flee Delhi. He threw away the murder weapon and also changed his clothes, but before he could go, he was arrested. Police said his using his cellphone at night gave his location and CCTV footage from around the crime scene helped police get a visual ID of him. Azad confessed to having attacked the family over a petty tiff. Police also found that a relative had slapped a case of sexual harassment against him. His wife had filed for divorce because of domestic violence , and they lived separately: he alone on the ground floor of their house, she with her two children on the first floor. For over 18 years, Azad worked as a mechanic in Saudi Arabia. A year ago, Khyala was witness to a similar incident barely a kilometre away at Raghubir Nagar in which a budding photographer was murdered in full public view by the family of his girlfriend. Locals said the police weren’t doing enough to stop illegal activities. ",17 Jan 2019,2019-01-17 00:00:00

Stating that the situation was limping back to normal and efforts were on to expedite it, Khandu said he sought additional forces from the Centre, which had already sent 1,000 paramilitary personnel to assist the state government in restoring peace. ""I believe that there are forces behind these incidents as Arunachal is a peaceful state, particularly Itanagar ,"" Khandu said in a statement earlier in the day. Addressing a press conference here after attending a cabinet meeting in the evening, the chief minister dismissed the Congress' demand for his resignation. ""The violent protests could be politically-backed. Why should I resign?"" Khandu asked. Protests broke out in Itanagar and Naharlagun town on Saturday after the ruling BJP government announced that it was considering issuing permanent residence certificate (PRC) to six communities who are not natives of Arunachal Pradesh, but are living in the state for decades. The six communities are Deoris, Sonowal Kacharis, Morans, Gorkhas, Adivasis and Mishings. The chief minister appealed to the people to end the protests and cooperate with the government in maintaining peace, saying the administration had already cleared its stand on the PRC. Stating that the issue ""is closed"", the chief minister hinted at a communication gap for which the latest government stand on the PRC had not reached the people and led to violence. He also talked over phone to leaders of various communities who were protesting the PRC issue. Khandu announced Rs 20 lakh as ex gratia for the next of kin of the three persons killed during the protests and Rs 10 lakh each for the seriously-injured. He said a loss-assessment committee had been set up to compensate those people whose properties were damaged during the protests since Saturday. Meanwhile, bodies of the two youths killed in police firing on Sunday were taken to North Lakhimpur in neighbouring Assam for post-mortem. The mortal remains would be sent to their homes from there, a senior police official told PTI. The police had opened fire when a mob was proceeding towards the chief minister's residence after setting fire to the private residence of deputy chief minister Chowna Mein . The Northeast frontier railway announced that the New Delhi-Naharlagun Arunachal Express would be short-terminated at Harmuti in Assam, about 35 km from here, till the situation normalises.

People in both Narkeldanga, where Ashiq lives, and Phoolbagan areas think there is an urgent need for rational and logical sense to prevail. The locals in both areas admitted that rumours were snowballing and such incidents were a reaction to that. Ashiq, who is critical and is admitted to a nursing home off EM Bypass, was apprehended by the locals in the Harijan settlements in the Dompara area on Friday. Residents said that when asked about his identity, he could not say anything. Some of the men who had gathered at the spot mistook him for a child trafficker and started beating him up. On Saturday, 17 people were arrested. “We have never faced such trouble in the past, nor have we heard of such an incident in the locality,” said Mamata, wife of Kailash Das who was picked up by cops on Saturday. The wife of another person who was taken in by the police, Guriya Das, said, “My husband Sanjay works as a daily wage labourer. Now that he is in custody, there is nobody to support the family. I wish there was no trouble that day,” she said. In Narkeldanga, Ashiq’s family was distraught, trying to get updates on his health on a regular basis.

Later, the police came to inform us about the incident,” said his brother. The video, in which Ashiq was seen being beaten up mercilessly, had gone viral in the thickly populated neighbourhood. “They hit his head with a stone. We have never seen such madness in people. The rumours of child traffickers has gained traction in our locality too. But one must apply logic before resorting to violence,” said Md Raju, Ashiq’s friend. “The police asked us to stay calm and assured us of all help,” he added. ",25 Feb 2019,2019-02-25 00:00:00

The seized weapons include a sword , two daggers , several wooden batons, granite pieces and around 500 mililitres of hydrogen peroxide solution. The raid was conducted by a team led by Nedumangad station house officer inspector Sajimon. He said that arms and chemical solution were seized from the room in the RSS office in which Praveen, who hailed from Nooranad near Kayamkulam, lived. Meanwhile, Praveen still remained at large, the inspector said. Praveen was caught on camera hurling explosives at Nedumangad police station repeatedly during the hartal last week. His actions were caught by the surveillance cameras installed at the police station. Deputy superintendent of police (Crime Branch, Rural) D Ashokan, who is in charge of Nedumangad police sub-division, said that the solution of hydrogen peroxide, when mixed with acetone, would turn into explosive substance with deadly power. The sale of the chemical substance was restricted. The police would probe how Praveen got hold of the substance. “All substances seized would be produced before the court on Thursday,” the DSP said.

The National Family Health Surveys have shown that domestic violence affects every third woman living in rural India. Data from FPAI’s clinics across Mumbai bear out the seriousness of the problem. Till September 2018, almost 28% of the 5,312 women who came to FPAI’s health clinics for medical help needed to be counselled about gender-based violence. “On talking to these women, we find that domestic violence could be at the root of their health problems and counsel them accordingly,” said a senior FPAI official. The corresponding numbers of 2016 and 2017 were 26% and 23% respectively. FPAI found that 29% of the 1.34 lakh women who sought medical help at its clinics running in 18 states in 2018 needed counselling for violence that they had faced. “Gender-based violence has a serious health implication on all women and more so on those in reproductive health age,” said Sangeeta Rege of CEHAT (Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes). Domestic violence is so widespread in the country, in fact, that a study carried out by Cehat in 2015-2017 found 16% prevalence of domestic violence faced by pregnant women. “This dispels the notion that pregnancy is a safe period for women,” said Rege. “The study highlighted that this prevalence is comparable to that two other big health problems for Indian women, that is gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, but it has not been given much attention.” The Cehat study also showed that advice offered to these women enabled them to stop violence in various ways, such as disclosing abuse to their parents. “These women also recognized the health impact of the violence and got doctors and nurses to speak to husbands/abusers about the impact of violence on their health,” said Rege. Numbers provided by the United Nations Population Fund Report reveal that 66% of married Indian women have suffered from domestic violence, and as many as 70% of married women in India between the ages of 15 and 49 are subjected to beating, rape or forced sex, said Apte. FPA India recently launched a nationwide campaign #StreeHinsaMuktBharatAbhiyaan with the aim of “breaking the silence around gender-based violence” on the lines of an international campaign to challenge violence against girls and women. The marathon will be an effort to spread awareness about the need to talk and address the critical issue afflicting women. ",12 Jan 2019,2019-01-12 00:00:00

Ruing that a situation has come when events and functions should be organised to spread awareness about rape and violence against women and children, Justice Kirubakaran said domestic unrest was the root cause of many a social ill. He was speaking at a book release function here. The judge said joint family system offered a mix of all human feeling and experiences and prepared youngsters for challenges in open society. A family busy with machines and social media platforms deprived children of fundamental values, said Justice Kirubakaran. Touching upon issues ranging from domestic violence to sexual harassment, as found in the book authored by lawyer A P Suryaprakasam, Justice Kirubakaran pointed out that involvement of women in crimes against women, particularly on issues involving dowry, was rampant. ""I'm pained when women battling domestic issues tell me that the parents of their husband were the problem. Violence against women and children have gone up mainly because we lack love, affection and supervision of elders in families,"" he said. Instances of domestic and sexual harassment reflected personality disorder and psychological disorder, he said, adding that though India had the dubious distinction of having maximum number of persons with psychological disorders, the nation did not have enough counsellors and psychiatrists. “Only by making offenders suffer the pain by due process of law, we could deter such people from targeting children and women,” said Justice Kirubakaran. Criticising the state liquor policy, he said many families had been ruined by fresh availability of alcohol, which has damaged individual families as well as the society. Earlier, Justice (retd) K N Basha said he would get outraged at news of sexual harassment of children by people trusted by them, like teachers and relatives. Senior Congress leader and seasoned lawmaker Peter Alphonse said the functioning of the democracy was revolving around judiciary. “Judicial activism is an accepted reality now, and its role in moderating democratic institutions can't be undermined,” he said.

They want to create an impression that there are law and order troubles in Kerala. This is the agenda behind raising the issue in the Lok Sabha. Despite the violence wreaked by Sangh Parivar, the state is standing strong. People have realized the intentions of the Sangh Parivar, to create a communal divide and destabilize the harmony prevailing in state. It is an irony that the party which is ruling the country is behind all the violence in Kerala,” said Vijayan. Everywhere RSS and BJP started the attacks against CPM leaders and their houses. In Thalassery alone, the houses of six CPM men were vandalized. It is quite natural that then there would be protest against it, he added. Meanwhile, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan alleged that those who are making hue and cry over the worsening law and order situation in state are keeping mum on the affairs in Uttar Pradesh. “Government sponsored riots are happening in UP. In 2017, 195 communal riots happened in UP while the figure was only 113 in the previous year,” Balakrishnan said, while responding to the demand made by BJP in Parliament to impose President’s rule in Kerala. Meanwhile, the law and order situation in the state attained normalcy on Monday. Police sources said the last reported violent incidents were from Koyilandi in Kozhikode where the house of a BJP worker was attacked late night on Sunday and from Nedumkandam in Idukki where a BMS office was attacked in the wee hours.

Jeweller family spat: Judicial custody for sons,Jeweller family spat: Judicial custody for sons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/jeweller-family-spat-judicial-custody-for-sons/articleshow/67427348.cms,en,"KOLKATA: Two sons of a family that has a prominent jewellery business in southeast Kolkata were sent to judicial custody by a local court on Monday, days after the estranged wife of one of them slapped serious charges of domestic violence and sexual abuse against them. The couple was in the midst of a separation case. Detective department officers indicated that they will now monitor the developments in the case that essentially will be handled by the southeast division police. Police sources said they were looking into a number of aspects — including the charges levelled against the woman and the actual contents of the divorce petition. “So far, prima facie, we are yet to establish anything that goes against the main ingredients of her core complaints,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. The police said they have recorded several statements in this regard. “We are going through them. Two statements are important here — the woman’s and her sister-in-law’s. The woman’s statement will be recorded at the earliest to ascertain the claims made by her in this case. We have made some progress on both fronts as the court has allowed our plea to get her statement recorded before a magistrate,” said an investigating officer. “Since there are certain aspects of rape and allegations of wife swapping, the statement of the sister-in-law is crucial,” said a source, adding that they were talking to the woman’s parents as well to ascertain if she had tried complaining earlier, especially after her daughter’s birth six years ago. The woman has moved police 13 years after her wedding. The jeweller’s family, though, has claimed it was a “pressure tactic” to ensure that the divorce case filed by the woman got stronger. The family also claimed that she had left her in-laws’ residence several months ago. “These are a set of lies to try and defame the family in an attempt to settle the divorce case in her favour,”said a family friend.

The court on February 22 directed chief secretaries and DGPs of 11 states to take ""prompt"" and ""necessary"" action to prevent incidents of alleged threat, social boycott and violence against Kashmiris following the Pulwama terror attack . A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi considered the submission of Attorney General K K Venugopal that no fresh incident of violence against Kashmiris had been reported after the apex court issued directions to protect the natives of Kashmir Valley who are living outside the state. The bench said no further orders were required at this stage in view of the Centre's submissions and posted the PIL filed by lawyer Tariq Adeeb for further hearing after two weeks. The court asked the states, which have not filed their responses, to do so within a week. The SC had sought a response from the Centre as well as the states where incidents of threat and violence against Kashmiris took place after the February 14 terror attack in which over 40 CRPF personnel were killed. ""The chief secretaries, the DGPs and the Delhi Police Commissioner are directed to take prompt and necessary action to prevent all the incidents of threat, assault, social boycott and other coercive acts against Kashmiris and other minorities in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of February 14,"" the court had said. The bench had perused the advisories issued by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to the chief secretaries and DGPs of the states from time to time and had said that they ""shall be reiterated from time to time"". The court had also directed that the police officers, who were earlier appointed as nodal officers to deal with cow vigilantism and lynching incidents, would now be responsible for dealing with the cases of assaults on Kashmiris as well. The SC had asked the home ministry to publicize the details of the nodal officers so that Kashmiri people can approach them in case of ""assault, intimidation, social boycott and threat"". Besides the Centre, top officials of Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir , Haryana, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Delhi were directed to prevent incidents of ""threat, assault and social boycott"" of Kashmiris, including students. The plea had alleged that students from Kashmir Valley were being attacked at different educational institutions across the country after the Pulwama attack and authorities concerned should be directed to take action. Venugopal had said that the ministry had issued the requisite advisory to states and Union Territories (UTs) on this issue on February 17. Such advisories were issued earlier as well, he said. The PIL sought a direction to the Centre and other authorities for prosecuting people engaging in hate speech, and to appoint a nodal officer in every state and UT, including politically-sensitive districts, to prevent acts of violence, discrimination and vigilantism. It had also sought immediate setting up of a nationwide helpline number and a website with the contact details of the nodal officers appointed in politically-sensitive districts. ""There is a sudden rise in the incidents of crimes against Muslims and Kashmiris after the Pulwama terrorist attack on February 14 in which over 40 soldiers were killed,"" the petition said. ""Immediately after the attack, mobs and vigilante groups engaged in vitriolic hate speech and began attacking, and threatening Muslims and Kashmiris throughout the country,"" it added. ""These incidents are a part of organised hate campaign against Muslims and Kashmiris, most cases which are fabricated and the hysteria that now surrounds India has been engineered to gain political mileage,"" it said further. ""The extremist groups have led vigilante mob attacks across the country to enforce nationalism by leaders of various groups who claim to promote and instigated hate crimes,"" it added.

Burglary incidents also witnessed an increase in comparison to 2016. The late response of police after crime incidents also led to increase in cases of protesters going berserk than previous years. The National Human Rights Commission has time and again pulled up the state police over recent rape incidents in the state. On December 1, a 22-year-old woman was raped and set ablaze while she was on way to file complaint against the crime perpetrators in Sitapur. Likewise, a minor was set on fire for resisting rape in Farrukhabad. A video of three men raping a woman in Unnao going viral also left police red faced. Police also came under attack over the rape of a teenage girl in Kanpur after which an irate crowd assaulted policemen. A new challenge arose before UP police as cybercrime incidents like card cloning rose sharply. Threats to ministers and MLAs on WhatsApp and lynching incidents in Hapur, Allahabad showed that state police reacted late and lead to mob fury. The recent killing of an inspector and civilian in mob violence at Bulandshahr after cattle carcasses were found outside a village proved a hard case to crack for police. Instances of burglaries in Kanpur and Allahabad involving big thefts led to police drawing lot of ridicule over its working and patrolling. Even the state capital witnessed several burglaries in posh areas. The Bawariya gangs from Rajasthan and Madhaya Pradesh continued their attacks in the state, posing tough challenge for police in Lucknow as well as in districts like Kannauj and Farrukhabad. UP police was also left red faced in killing of cops during mob fury, the recent one being the death of constable Suresh Vats in Ghazipur. The police dossier shows an increase of 15% in burglary, 14% in rape, and 14% in protest incidents. However, in comparison to 2017, the state witnessed minor depreciation in cases of dacoity, loot and murder. ",01 Jan 2019,2019-01-01 00:00:00

Ghani’s sharp criticism against Pakistan comes at a time when he has been pushed to the sidelines in the Pakistan led peace talks with the Afghan Taliban. In an apparent reference to the death of Arman Loni, a leader of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) during a sit-in at Loralai in Balochistan province recently, Ghani on Thursday, tweeted, “The Afghan government has serious concerns about the violence perpetrated against peaceful protestors and civil activists in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.” Criticizing the Pakistani crackdown against protesters staging demonstration against the killing of the PTM leader, Ghani in a subsequent tweet said, “We believe it is the moral responsibility of every government to support civil activities that take a stand against the terrorism and extremism that plagues and threatens our region and collective security. Otherwise there could be long-standing negative consequences.” Following Loni’s death, protest strikes were observed in Quetta, Balochistan’s capital, and other Pashtun majority area of the volatile province. The PTM claimed that the state was involved in the alleged killing of Loni. Two days ago, at least 18 PTM activists were arrested during a protest outside the Islamabad Press Club. The PTM was formed last year by Pashtun youth from tribal regions after the extra-judicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, a young Pashtun model from Waziristan, in a fake police encounter in Karachi. Ignored completely by the local media and mainstream political parties, for their strong views against the security establishment, the PTM had staged massive protests and rallies in different parts of the country against enforced disappearances, extrajudicial arrests and killings, as well as the mistreatment of the Pashtun community by security forces. “Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai, Iss ke peechay wardi hai” (the uniform is to be blamed for terrorism) is the movement’s main slogan. On Thursday, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi reacted sharply to the Afghan President’s comment and called it as “irresponsible” and a “gross interference” in the internal affairs of the country. “We reject the tweet by President Ashraf Ghani. Such irresponsible statements are only gross interference. Afghan leadership needs to focus on long-standing serious grievances of the Afghan people,” Qureshi posted on Twitter .

Room for leap forward in Indo-Pak trade in absence of violence: Bisaria,Room for leap forward in Indo-Pak trade in absence of violence: Bisaria,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/room-for-leap-forward-in-indo-pak-trade-in-absence-of-violence-bisaria/articleshow/67881884.cms,en,"ISLAMABAD: There is room for a leap forward in trade between India and Pakistan in an atmosphere free of distrust and violence, India's high commissioner here has said, insisting that humanitarian and trade exchanges between the two countries must continue despite ""roadblocks"". India follows a neighbourhood first policy to engage for mutual benefit with its neighbours and thus its relationship with Pakistan is of key importance, high commissioner Ajay Bisaria wrote in an article for Diplomatic News Agency (DNA) and Centreline journal, which is a sister publication of DNA. ""It is uniquely challenging. Both countries share deep historical, cultural, linguistic, religious and ethnic bonds. They face similar economic challenges"", he said. Bisaria said despite ""roadblocks"", humanitarian and trade exchanges between the two countries must continue. The Indo-Pak ties strained after the terror attacks by Pakistan-based terrorists in 2016 and India's surgical strikes inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The ties further nose-dived in 2017 with no bilateral talks taking place between them. India has been maintaining that terror and talks cannot go together. India remains a popular destination for medical tourists from Pakistan while thousands of members of divided families visit each other. According to a recent World Bank report, trade potential between the two countries stands at $37 billion per annum, he said. ""Our common enemies remain poverty, illiteracy and disease and not each other,"" Bisaria said, adding in the long run only sustained peace and shared progress will allow India and Pakistan to focus better on their domestic objectives of prosperity. He further said while the present trade between the two countries stands at around $2 billion, there is room for a leap forward once barriers are broken, in an atmosphere free of distrust and violence. Bisaria said that humanitarian initiatives occupy an important place in building trust between the two countries and the Kartarpur Corridor is one such initiative. To commemorate the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in 2019, the two countries have agreed to build a 'corridor of faith', with modern facilities for smooth visits of Sikh pilgrims from India to the holy shrine at Kartarpur Sahib. ""I am certain this vision will drive the relationship between India and Pakistan,"" he said. ""It is possible to achieve inclusive economic growth, without sacrificing democracy and diversity, without compromising on the values of pluralism and tolerance, which are the core values of our society,"" said Bisaria.

The cops had earlier even proposed to file untraced reports in these cases. The SIT, set up on August 17, 2017, has approached local magistrates in several cases for permission to conduct polygraph test of the suspects that it has identified. A weapon missing from the Meham police station and some mobile phones allegedly stolen from shops in Rohtak during the February 2016 agitation have also been recovered, according to details provided to the division bench headed by Punjab and Haryana high court Chief Justice Krishna Murari on Tuesday by the SIT chief and senior IPS officer Amitabh Singh Dhillon in a status report on his investigation till December 31, 2018. The SIT, which functions independently and reports to the high court only, was constituted by the HC after observing that the Haryana police had concluded that a majority of the cases registered for violence were of non-serious nature. Four units of the SIT, headed by SP-rank IPS officers Manisha Chaudhary, Pratiksha Godara, Ganga Ram Punia and Waseem Akram, are investigating 600 of the 1,105 cases, Dhillon revealed in his report. The members of the SIT have been directed to peruse the Prakash Singh committee report on Jat reservation to see if it offered any information that could be used in identifying suspects/culprits. Eleven suspects have been identified for their alleged involvement in causing damage and arson at Budhwar Car Pvt Ltd Rohtak. All cars parked in the car distribution agency were set on fire causing Rs 32 crore damage, as claimed by the owner. The SIT has identified the suspects from video footage and photographs. The tower dump data is being scrutinized to ascertain if the mobile phone numbers used by any of the suspects at the time of the incident were present at or near the place of occurrence. Similarly, the SIT arrested a suspect allegedly involved in stealing weapons from Meham police station in Rohtak district and a pistol has also been recovered. A copy of the status report was handed over to the high court by additional advocate general Haryana Pawan Girdhar on behalf of the SIT chief. Senior advocate Anupam Gupta, assisting the high court as amicus curiae in the matter, however, asked for time to examine the report so that he could address the court on the issue. ‘Enhanced claims by victims likely’ The SIT has expressed apprehension that some of the victims/complainants might have made false claims about stolen/damaged items, especially computers or mobile phones, from their shops damaged during the violence. “Incredibly enough, the complainants/victims are unable to provide information of even the shop from where the electronic items were purchased by them. The conduct does create suspicion that theft, looting/damage of expensive electronic items may have been included in the complaint by some of the victims to claim enhanced compensation from the government,” the report submitted to the high court said. ‘No information despite reward’ The SIT claimed that photographs of suspects were published in newspapers along with reward of Rs 10,000 for any information about them. However, no one came forward with any information till date. ",16 Jan 2019,2019-01-16 00:00:00

In a memorandum submitted to home minister Rajnath Singh , the Congress claimed there has been ""gross mismanagement"" by the Pema Khandu-led government in handling ""peaceful protests"" against the move to grant Permanent Resident Certificates to six communities, leading to loss of human lives and damages to properties of such magnitude which the state has never witnessed in its history. The Congress demanded setting up of a Commission of Enquiry, preferably by a sitting high court judge or a retired chief justice of high court, on firing and killing of innocent and unarmed protestors. It also sought immediate sacking of chief minister Pema Khandu, Deputy chief chinister Chowna Mein and Union Minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju , who hails from the state. The memorandum was signed by Arunachal Pradesh Congress committee President Takam Sanjoy, former chief minister Nabam Tuki and Congress general secretary (in-charge of Northeast) Luizinho Faleiro. The Congress leaders said there has been continuing deterioration of the law and order in Arunachal Pradesh leading to the unprovoked killing of three innocents by the police forces and injury to 15 others. ""We are receiving reports that the situation remains volatile and further escalation is expected with the violence and unrest rapidly spreading to other parts of the state. The state government law and order machinery is in a state of complete collapse. ""The situation warrants that the Centre takes a serious view on these developments. The state government has completely failed and remains a mute spectator to the unfolding events over the past two days,"" the leaders said in the memorandum. Three people lost their lives during violent protests over granting the PRC to six non-Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe (APSTs) communities living in Namsai and Changlang districts — Deoris, Sonowal-Kacharis, Morans, Adivasis and Mishings — and to the Gorkhas living in Vijaynagar. Most of these communities are recognised as Scheduled Tribes in neighbouring Assam. Curfew was clamped in Itanagar and adjoining Naharlagun town on Saturday, but it did not deter protesters from venturing into the troubled streets that were scene of pitched battles with security forces over the last three days. No major incident of violence has been reported from anywhere since Monday morning as Arunachal Scouts, an infantry regiment of the Army trained in mountain warfare, marched through the streets of the two towns to instill confidence among people and ward off possible violence, officials said.

Rather has filed a counter-complaint against her for causing damage to his public reputation. This after Rather had alleged that on December 26, Singh had called him a “convict of 10 bomb blasts” while she was on her way to her department and had a verbal spat with a group of students standing near the Sanskrit school canteen. JNUTA also released a statement and condemned Singh for her alleged statement. Singh, though, denied the charges and said “the allegations are part of their design to stay in the news and to spread fake news against me”. Singh said on December 26, she saw four boys smoking outside the canteen. “When I asked them not to do so at a public place and asked them their names, they became aggressive. I didn't even know who these boys were, and if they were JNU students or outsiders,” Singh told TOI. JNUSU secretary Aejaz Rather had claimed that the professor had said that he looked like a terrorist. After that, JNUTA had come out with a statement condemning Singh and called for an inquiry against her. A protest also took place outside Singh’s office on December 31 after which she filed a police complaint against Rather and JNUTA president Atul Sood for allegedly circulating fake news and trying to disturb peace and communal harmony, and incite violence and divisiveness on campus. In response to Singh’s complaint, Rather said, “She is continuously vilifying me through her vicious campaign and language, which has given me serious mental harassment and has caused my communal profiling. This atrocious behaviour is enough to prove that it is her deliberate attempt to malign my image in public, including on social media, particularly through her recent tweets.” Police would examine it and take legal action.

The court, though, said that since the case invites a 10-year punishment, the accused needed to approach a higher court to seek bail. Lawyers representing the two sides confirmed the development and stated that though the submission did not directly refer to withdrawal of the case, the wording indicated that the matter had been “amicably settled” out of court. Sources indicated that the divorce between the two sides is likely to be the major point of discussion. The development came on the day the complainant was scheduled to record her statement before the magistrate. The development has left cops in a spot of bother with questions being raised on their line of action in the future. For now, the investigators insisted the probe would continue.
