Nationwide, protesters were estimated at 32,300, compared with 28,600 last week.ULTRA VIOLENTInterior Minister Christophe Castaner said that although the protest was relatively small, there had been more than 1,500 ""ultra violent"" people out looking for trouble.""They decided, perhaps as a swansong, to come attack - and I use their words - Paris,"" Castaner said, adding that more than 1,400 police officers were mobilised.A separate, peaceful march against climate change through central Paris drew as many 36,000 people, police estimated. Some 145,000 people marched nationwide.Yellow vest protesters had promised to draw bigger numbers to mark the fourth month since the movement erupted in mid November over since-scrapped fuel tax hikes and the cost of living.Named after the high-visibility vests French drivers have to keep in their cars and worn by protesters, the revolt swelled into a broader movement against Macron, his reforms and elitism.However, the weekly demonstrations, held every Saturday in Paris and other cities, have been generally getting smaller since December, when Paris saw some of the worst vandalism and looting in decades.After the spike in violence, Macron offered a package of concessions worth more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) aimed at boosting the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners.His government ordered police to crack down on the protests in January, leading to complaints of police brutality.The 41-year-old former investment banker also launched a series of national debates aimed at determining what policies people want the government to focus on. Saturday's protests coincided with the end of the debates."

""The man who imposes his Mann Ki Baat on India is attacking all our institutions one after the other,"" the Congress president said.Though Congress is trying to work out 'tactical adjustments' with CPM in Bengal, Rahul refused to spare the Left party inKerala, saying that the only thing CPM is capable of is violence and that its ideology was ""deformed"". ""I think the CPM will take some more time to realise that their ideology is defunct. They are clutching at straws,"" the Congress president said.Earlier in the day, Rahul visited the houses of the two Youth Congress workers who were brutally murdered last month at Periya inKasaragod district, allegedly by CPM, and said that he would ensure that those guilty would be punished. ""I understand that these families haven't got justice, but we will do the needful once we come to power,"" he said. His first public engagement of the day was atTriprayarwhere he inaugurated the maiden National Fish Workers' Parliament and promised the creation of a separate ministry for the fishery sector.At the Kozhikode rally, Rahul launched a broadside at the CPM-led government, saying the Left party thinks it can remain in power only through violence. ""There are no jobs. Three lakh women in the cashew industry have lost their jobs... many cashew processing units have been closed,"" he said.‘It’s an ideological battle’Referring to the killing of Youth Congress activists Kripesh and Sarath Lal, Rahul said: “No Way. I want to tell you that Kerala is the land of justice. These two people (Kripesh and Sarath Lal) will get justice. Those who did it to them would face justice.”Emphasizing ‘justice’, he said, “The Congress party is not going to allow anybody to get away from justice. It doesn’t matter even if he is the Prime Minister of India”. Pointing out that he was happy to come to a state where people of different ideas and religions live together happily, he said an “ideological battle” was being played out in the country today. “Congress does not want to impose anything on India... The Congress party wants to listen to what people have to say and act accordingly”, the Congress president said."

The fire service evacuated the residents and extinguished the blaze. Eleven people, including two fire fighters, suffered minor injuries, the fire service told AFP.A mother of four children, including a nine-month-old baby, told AFP they escaped via the stairs after seeing the fire from their window.Interior minister Christophe Castaner in a tweet accused the arsonists of being ""neither demonstrators, nor trouble-makers"" but ""murderers"".Eighty-two people had been arrested by the early afternoon, the police said.The protests came a day after President Emmanuel Macron arrived in the southwestern Pyrenees mountains with his wife Brigitte for a short ski break, an AFP photographer reported.""I'm going to spend two to three days here to rest and rediscover landscapes and faces that are dear to me,"" Macron told La Depeche du Midi newspaper.Saturday's turnout is a test for the ""yellow vest"" movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes and quickly ballooned into a anti-government rebellion but has struggled lately to mobilise large numbers of protesters.Last week, only around 28,000 people demonstrated nationwide, according to the authorities, a tenth of the numbers that turned out for the inaugural protest on November 17.The rally coincides with the end of the public debates called by President Emmanuel Macron to try take the heat out of the protests and give voters a forum to propose policy changes.Around half a million people turned out at townhall-style meetings held around the country over the past two months.But many ""yellow vests"" dismissed the consultation as a smoke-screen.The police on Saturday used tear gas and water cannon to repel protesters who gathered at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe war memorial, which was sacked by protesters on December 1 in scenes that drew international condemnation.Several news stands also went up in smoke as groups of mostly black-clad demonstrators pelted the security forces with stones and erected barricades.""There are a number of people who have come just to smash things,"" Castaner said, estimating that some 1,500 ""ultra violent"" activists had infiltrated the crowd of ""between 7,000 and 8,000"".On social media, ""yellow vest"" leaders had hinted at the arrival of sympathisers from Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and even Poland.""Macron, we're coming to get you at home,"" some of the protesters chanted, referring to the presidential palace situated near the Champs-Elysees.From early morning protesters began pouring into the capital by train and car from around the country for what they called an ""ultimatum"" to Macron.Over 5,000 police were deployed, along with several armoured police vehicles, and several metro stations were closed.Macron, who was caught off guard when grassroots protesters began occupying traffic roundabouts in November over fuel taxes, has loosened the state's purse strings to the tune of 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) to try defuse the protests.He also travelled the length and breadth of the country, engaging in marathon debates with local politicians and voters.But the measures failed to quell the anger of the demonstrators, who accuse the former investment banker, of being in the pocket of the rich.Laurent Casanova, an engineer who was among the protesters on Saturday, told AFP he wanted to mark the end of the debates.""We have been patient but now we want results,"" he said.The protest was one of several planned in Paris on Saturday, where climate campaigners also gathered in their thousands to demand Macron go further on greening the economy."

The talks began January 24 in Sudan's capital, Khartoum.The agreement represents rare hope for the impoverished, landlocked nation where interreligious and intercommunal fighting has continued since 2013. Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in a conflict that has sent at least two people to the International Criminal Court.""This is a great day for Central African Republic and all its people,"" said the AU commissioner for peace and security, Smail Chergui.The fighting in Central African Republic has carried the high risk of genocide, the UN has warned. Scores of mosques have been burned. Priests and other religious leaders have been killed. Many Muslims have fled the country.After more than 40 people were killed in a rebel attack on a displaced persons camp in November, both the leader of the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission and the country's prime minister both acknowledged shortcomings in the response. ""I knew that we did not have all the necessary means to protect our people,"" the prime minister said.The fighting began in 2013 when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back. Violence intensified and spread last year after a period of relative peace as armed groups battle over lands rich in gold, diamonds and uranium.In a grim report last year marking five years of the conflict, the UN children's agency said fighters often target civilians rather than each other, attacking health facilities and schools, mosques and churches and camps for displaced people. At least half of the more than 640,000 people displaced are children, it said, and thousands are thought to have joined the armed groups, often under pressure.As the peace talks began, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned of ""catastrophe"" if no agreement was reached, saying repeated cycles of violence in one of the world's poorest nations had ""pushed people(asterisk)s resistance to breaking point.""A majority of Central African Republic's 2.9 million people urgently need humanitarian support, the group said.On Thursday, the UN Security Council voted unanimously to extend an arms embargo on Central African Republic for a year but raised the possibility that it could be lifted earlier as the government has long urged."

The road leads to Delhi-Moradabad highway.After violence broke out, police were quick to set up holding areas on the route and divert traffic from the congregation which was attended by lakhs.The state government has also acknowledged that the violence was ‘part of a larger conspiracy’ and in a late night review meeting held on Tuesday, chief ministerYogi Adityanathdirected Director General of Police (DGP) O P Singh to trace the conspirators and perpetrators and take stringent action against them.“How did the carcasses reach the site from where they were recovered and who was behind this is also a major focus of the probe,” the DGP said on Wednesday.The investigators were also puzzled by the fact that why would anyone slaughter cows in an open field unless mischief was the motive. Sources, however, said that slaughter of cows was nothing new in the region. Recently, a major protest against cow slaughter was held outside same police outpost which was attacked by mob during Monday’s violence.“The site is also important because of its proximity to the national capital.

Who brought this?” asks one of the men in the clip. Another man replies, “This one has been slaughtered by a __”.“Mullan is a term used colloquially forMullah(Muslim).

This is not only a law and order issue; question is how did the cattle carcass reach there? Who brought it, why and under what circumstances. These angles are being probed,” said state director general of police OP Singh. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, IG crime SK Bhagat, while replying to a query on the possibility of conspiracy, said that the initial probe has found that the carcass was old. “The cow carcass is being assumed to be at least two days old. The final conclusion will be based on a forensic lab report,” said Bhagat.Cops: Bajrang Dal man was complainant in first caseUP Police also said that footages are being accessed and collected to identify the man who fired the shot at inspector Subodh Kumar Singh.On Monday, UP Police had registered two cases — first involving alleged cow slaughter on complaint of pro-Hindu outfit Bajrang Dal district coordinator Yogesh Raj and second on the violent clashes and riots leading to killings of Subodh Kumar Singh and a civilian. Raj was complainant in the first case but after brouhaha over violence that spread across Bulandshahr, UP Police turned him into an accused with charges of murder and rioting against him. Raj, 27, is absconding and has been releasing videos pleading his innocence.UP Police also revealed that they have registered another case on discovery of carcass on Amargarh Road under Jahangirabad police station of Bulandshahr. “Police had received the information on cow slaughter here and went on to arrest four men after recovering the cow carcass.

In his address to the state BJP council meeting here Tuesday, chief ministerPema Khandusaid justice would be delivered to the bereaved families and the people responsible for unleashing the violence would be brought to book.The probe would be carried out by a committee headed by a retired judge, a CMO communique said on Wednesday.Protests had erupted inItanagarand adjoiningNaharlagunin late February over the proposed grant of permanent resident certificates (PRC) to six non-Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe (APSTs) communities living in the Namsai and Changlang districts and to the Gorkhas living in Vijaynagar.Curfew clamped in Itanagar and Naharlagun town failed to deter protesters from venturing into the streets and pelting stones that left 35 people, including 24 police personnel, injured.The private residence of deputy chief minister Chowna Mein was set ablaze and the office of the Itanagar deputy commissioner ransacked.Clarifying that the state government had never intended to move a resolution or a bill in the Assembly over the PRC, Khandu said the matter was to be taken up for deliberations during a short-duration discussion in the House and to make the recommendations of the Joint High Power Committee (JHPC) on the PRC public.""The state government had planned to make wider public consultation involving all stakeholders, community-based organisations, student organisations and other bodies,"" the chief minister said. The issue was ""misinterpreted"", causing unrest among the students, Khandu said. A statement was issued on social media platforms that the PRC issue would not be taken up further, he said. PTI"

The flat is jointly owned by the woman and her estranged, US-resident husband.“If there is nodomesticviolence, then other relief cannot be sought under the DV Act,” said the magistrate R S Jambotkar, adding that the dispute between the two appeared to be over a flat for which she could approach a civil court in Mumbai for relief.Last year, she had sought to invoke the salutary provisions of a 2005 law, Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, to secure her rights to the shared residence, a monthly maintenance of Rs 2.5 lakh and “Rs 5 crore as compensation and reimbursement during their separation”. The woman said she was forced to live with her mother since 2008.Married in 1994, both lived in the US initially where she alleged violence in 1999. Both lived in Mumbai between 2006 and 2008 when she alleged he was “suspicious and violent” and in May 2008 allegedly tried to suffocate her with a pillow. She alleged by June last year, he dispossessed her of the Matunga flat, for which she had contributed too, by changing the lock. Citing judgments, her lawyer Haresh Thacker argued the law would apply to even shared household in existence before the Act coming in force.The husband’s lawyer, Ishika Tolani, though, questioned maintainability of her plea on grounds of delay of 10 years and lack of proof. His lawyer said he had applied for divorce before a US court which granted it in early 2018. The court observed the woman did not file an FIR over the allegations. “It is impossible that a highly educated lady” keeps “mum” and gives no explanation for not seeking any protective order under DV Act so far, raising doubts about her allegations, said the court in its order. It said though both began to live separately in 2008, dispute over the flat arose in June 2017, “so it is a clear case that she was not dispossessed by domestic violence”."

""After that he'll be able to pay bail and get out on parole. Then, when there's a general amnesty, he'll benefit from it.""That is why specific legislation is needed, women's rights activists argue.They hold periodic sit-ins at parliament to demand passage of the law, noting that it was drafted by civil society, Islamic scholars and jurists and stayed within the bounds of Sharia law.MPs from both the ruling party and the opposition voted down the bill in January 2017.In December 2018, the draft did not even proceed past the parliament's Islamic Orientation Commission, which vets proposed law for its conformity with Sharia.""We rejected this law because it was not aligned with Sharia and our cultural specificities,"" said Zeinabou Taghi, an MP of the opposition Islamist party Tewassoul.The penalties ""appear to interfere with private life,"" she said.She objected to punishing a man for forbidding his wife to wear figure-revealing clothes, or for forbidding his daughter to live on her own with no husband.For her part, opposition MP Nana Mint Cheikhna of the Rally for Democratic Forces (RFD) said she backed the bill, despite reservations about vague text.""Women obviously need protection... in a society where they are considered minors, both in people's minds and in practice,"" she said.In September, HRW had praised the bill as a ""step in the right direction"" but said it ""falls short of international standards in several ways.""The draft bill ""fails to criminalise other forms of sexual assault"" besides rape, it said, adding that it still criminalised consensual extra-marital sex and allowed the law criminalisingabortionto remain on the books."

In other suggestions, Singh said security audit of campuses should be done along with local police and proctors should be vested with more powers — like those given to an executive magistrate — to control hooligans."

To start with, 10 students from each department — history, geography, sociology, education and law — will visit the selected villages in a month and conduct a survey of the various facilities available as well as their requirements.PU has already selected the villages — Dhibra (Jamsaut panchayat of Danapur block), Chhitnawan (Khashipur panchayat of Maner block), Dhaulpura (Marchi panchayat of Patna Sadar), Saim Chak (Chilbilli panchayat of Phulwari block) and Bahuwara (Chipura panchayat of Sampatchak block) — under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA), a flagship programme launched by the Union HRD ministry for transfer of knowledge to enrich rural India. The district administration has helped the university in identifying these villages for the development plan.PU is expected to work closely with the district administration to provide customized technological solutions, undertake field studies, study government schemes and facilitate their implementation according to local needs. All the teachers, students, officials and non-teaching staff of the university and its colleges will be associated with this scheme for apprising them with the rural realities.“Students and faculty members will study the living conditions in the adopted villages and assess the local problems and needs. They will work out the possibilities of leveraging the technological interventions and the need to improve the processes in implementation of various government schemes and prepare workable action plans for the selected villages. Experts from IITs will provide technological solutions to the problems identified in these villages,” PU NSS programme and UBA coordinator Atul Aditya Pandey said and added students from other departments, including rural studies, PMIR and social work, would also come forward for the noble venture later."

Tension mounted after masked men allegedly entered a polling booth.The SAD leader claimed that after capturing the booth, the accused started casting votes in favour of ruling party’s Bhajan Singh. He added that apart from beating his supporters, the masked men also fired in the air.Controlling officer Lovejeet Kalsi reached the spot and said that the returning officer would submit a report to the deputy commissioner.Bhajan Singh, meanwhile, refuted the allegations.Police officials said voting was suspended after the incident. The returning officer in his report has said that unidentified persons entered the polling booth and tried to damage ballot papers and cast votes, they added.DSP (investigation) Ludhiana (Rural Police) Amandeep Singh said, “We are lodging a case on the basis of report of the returning officer under Punjab State Election Commission Act 1994 against unidentified persons. We are probing the firing allegations, but we haven’t received any complaint about it.”Manpreet Ayali, former MLA of Dakha who visited Detwal, said, “We sought re-polling after the incident.

However, later, he was seen in the village mobilizing support for party candidate Gurmeet Singh.Yadwinder Singh told The Times of India that in the morning, three to four vehicles of police reached the village. “Cops asked me to get inside the vehicle, saying I could not roam around. As I refused, villagers gathered at the spot. Police officers then left,” he added.“They didn’t even ask us anything. I had the papers of our candidate’s polling agent. How could they stop us,” the SAD leader said.Refuting Yadwinder Singh’s allegations, a senior police officer of Khanna said, “There was a duty magistrate at the polling booth. Had Yadwinder been stopped from entering the booth, then the duty magistrate would have taken note of it. Besides, the process was being video-graphed at the booth.”There were reports of brief stone pelting in Ghudani Kalan village after SAD-BJP candidate Gurinder Singh objected to the entry of a few supporters of Congress candidate Harwinder Singh inside the polling booth. Nobody was injured as prompt action by police helped control the situation. “Voting at Ghudani Kalan polling booth went off peacefully,” the Khanna cop said.Supporters of a panch candidate objected to the absence of their symbol in the ballot papers in Jassiyan. They added that polling staff were frequently going out and returning to the booth. There were also reports of face-off of supporters of two candidates in Bulara village of Dehlon, but authorities managed to cool the tempers down.DIST RECORDS 80% VOTINGDeputy commissioner Pardeep Aggarwal said final turnout of voters in Ludhiana district was around 80%"

It is a party which had to face violence on several occasions and there was no need for it to conspire the murder of the Youth Congress workers,"" he said, replying to a reporter's question over the issue.""At a time when the CPM is organising party yatras ahead of theLok Sabhapolls, will anyone with minimum political literacy indulge in such a crime?,"" Vijayan asked.The chief minister's remarks came at a time when the ruling party is facing the heat over the killings of Kripesh (24) and Sarath Lal (21), the Youth Congress activists who were waylaid and attacked while returning home after attending a function at Periya in Kasaragod on Sunday night.Opposition Congress and BJP have alleged that the killings were executed with the knowledge and support of the leadership of the rulingCommunist Partyof India (Marxist).Meanwhile, state CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan reiterated on Tuesday that his party had no knowledge about the twin killings.""Whoever be the accused, they should be brought before the law. We do not endorse the politics of killings,"" he said in Kollam.Rejecting the claims of Vijayan and Balakrishnan, state Youth Congress president Dean Kuriakose demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the gruesome incident.""We do not trust the ongoing police investigation and demand a CBI probe into the killing of our activists,"" he said, adding that not only those who had executed the killings, but the conspirators should also be brought before law.Three Youth Congress workers had lost their lives in the last one year due to political rivalry, Kuriakose noted.Demanding a comprehensive and judicious probe, Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ramesh Chennithala visitedGovernorP Sathasivam at the Raj Bhavan here.The Congress leader later told reporters that the governor assured him that he would seek a report from the LDF government regarding the incident.Meanwhile, the police are continuing with the interrogation of those taken into custody in connection with the incident.Two persons were taken into custody on Monday.Two motorcycles, suspected to have been used by those responsible for the brutal attacks on the Youth Congress workers, were also seized.Normal life was affected and incidents of violence were reported from various places during a dawn-to-duskhartalcalled by the Youth Congress in Kerala on Monday."

They are a threat to the university and need to be tackled properly, said vice-chancellor of Nagpur University SP Kane, on Friday.Kane said these words in his presidential address at the 17th edition of ‘Justa Causa’, a three-day national festival, at Dr BabasahebAmbedkar Collegeof Law.Kane said, “A society cannot function without the existence of law. Therefore, laws are needed to be formulated and amended as time progresses. In a court, there are lawyers and judges. Nobody ever questions the decisions of the judge. However, in a university, the VC has to play both, the lawyer and the judge, if the decisions are challenged.”Former high court judge Vasanti Naik was the chief guest of the inaugural function. Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam and college principal Shrikant Komawar were also present.Delivering the keynote address, Nikam said, “Women have every right to lead a peaceful life and not resign their fate to the never-ending cycle of enduringdomestic violenceand discrimination.”To mark the International Women’s Day, the theme of the law festival is ‘Protection of women against domestic violence’.Nikam said, “Domestic violence is a torturous phenomenon which is not confined to any race, caste or creed. Every country is faced with this problem for which an effective solution should be evolved.”“We advocates, at present, lack depth of knowledge and are therefore losing credibility. Good lawyers should possess qualities like honesty and integrity, backed by deep study of law, to excel in the field,” he said.He said, “The tongue of an advocate is mightier than pen and sword as it can serve punishment to the guilty and set the innocent free. Advocacy is an individualistic art that requires practical and legal training.”In her address, Justice (retd) Naik provided an insight into Domestic Violence Act. There were many central and state laws, but they were inadequate. The Domestic Violence Act, in force since October 26, 2007, is path-breaking, she added.Komawar said, “The sapling of ‘Justa Causa’ was sown 17 years ago and we have tried our best to nurture it. This event has a noble cause of polishing skills of the aspiring lawyers from across the country.”He said 20 teams from premier law institutions are participating in the festival. Activities like moot court, seminar, legal drafting, debate competitions and general quiz will be organized during the period, he added.Chinmayee Nimkhedkar and Mrunmayee Kukdey conducted the inaugural function. Kalyani Kapse proposed a vote of thanks. Pravina Khobragade and Adhara Deshpande are the conveners of the event.BhagyashreeDhotre presented ‘Ganesh vandana’."

It is the world's largest single-dish steerable millimeter-wavelengthtelescopeand is jointly run by the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Mexico's national institute of astrophysics.LMT ""has reduced its scientific activities to a minimum level due to the security problems in the region surrounding the telescope,'' said university spokesman Ed Blaguszewski.""The University of Massachusetts Amherst has suspended travel of UMass personnel to the LMT site, and we have retained security consultants to advise us on security risks in the area and strategies to deal with these risks,'' he said.Mexico's astrophysics institute said in a statement that ``the unsafe conditions that prevail in the region are well known and public.''The other affected site is the HAWC gamma ray and cosmic ray observation facility.

The findings on the lack of disclosure are part of an analysis of the national family health survey - 4 (2015-16) that show of 4.4 lakh adolescent girls who were victims of sexual violence in the year preceding the survey, 35% neither sought help or told anyone.

The study suggests that since in most cases the perpetrator is a known person, prevention strategies need to focus on ""potential perpetrators"". It is emphasised that mobility restrictions on girls out of fear of strangers will not work as a preventive measure.The study recommends reduction in stigmatisation and improved police response can facilitate victims' disclosure. ""This prevalence was calculated for the population of all women aged 15-49 years, and by age category,"" Dr Raj said."

Those who tried to get out on their own had to return after witnessing violent protests.“I tried going out at 3pm and after driving for some 2km, I saw a mob burning tyres and standing in groups in the middle of the road and threatening people to go back. I have come back since I don't know when I will be able to go,” said a woman-entrepreneur who runs a factory in Chakan. She said, there was no police present at the spot.A representative of an auto firm said that his company's HR has stopped buses from moving outside the office premises.“We are told that the situation will normalise in 1-2 hours and then depending on the prevailing situation, we can move the buses,” he said.The employers allowed buses to ply out only after 7.40 pm, after the police informed them of the situation being brought under control.Many from the industries felt that the protestors had chosen the spot quite “strategically.”A head of a company said: ""By staging their violent protest in Chakan, they are sending a message that they can choke the corridors of money whenever they want. They also get a ready audience in the labour class and farmers,” he said.A worker said that there are hardly any government offices in Chakan and their demand is for reservations in government jobs.“I wonder what they are trying to do and to whom by threatening multinational companies,” he said.For many foreign delegates, who visit Chakan frequently, it was a nightmarish experience.“We had a foreign delegation and they haven’t seen anything like this before. We heard them calling back home and describing the situation as ‘horrible.’ Such events have a negative impact on the investment potential of the area,” said a representative of the Federation of Chakan Industries.Another worker told his relative through a whatsapp text: “Still in office. Not getting out. Our HR is monitoring the situation. Do not know when we will be able to come home.”The attempt to choke economic corridors of power during the strike has followed a eerie pattern.On Thursday, a company had to reschedule its board meeting to another part of the city - some 40km away - as protesters had laid siege in Talegaon area.Chakan is known to have a very slim police presence. Policemen in the area often request industrialists to provide manpower and vehicles to them.""I think the protestors were emboldened because they know how inadequate the police machinery in this part of the city is,"" said a general manager of a manufacturing firm."
"Dowry harassment cases in Karnataka dip 34%, convictions 100%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dowry-harassment-cases-in-state-dip-34-convictions-100/articleshow/68276768.cms,"Bengaluru news, Bengaluru latest news, Bengaluru news live, Bengaluru news today, Today news Bengaluru, Karnataka,Dowry Harassment,domestic violence,decline,Convictions,cases in Karnataka","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-68282377,imgsize-154910,width-400,resizemode-4/68282377.jpg","BENGALURU:Domestic violenceanddowry harassmentcases against married men or their relatives have reduced drastically in the past six years in the state, according toKarnatakapolice data. The conviction rate has also plummeted.Cases pertaining to domestic violence against women and dowry harassment are registered under IPC Section 498A, titled ‘husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty’.In 2013, a total of 3,187 cases were registered against husbands; the number dipped to 2,102 in 2018. Theconvictionsin the corresponding period fell from 43 to 0.Stakeholders point to different reasons for the trend. According to police, change in family size and lifestyle, including interfaith and intercaste marriages, have hugely contributed to thedecline. “Also, a poor conviction rate discourages women from raising complaints against their husbands. Out-of-court settlements, lack of evidence and victims turning hostile are plaguing the system,” police officers said.TimesViewThe decline in dowry cases is a positive development, given the physical, mental and emotional trauma women have experienced for ages due to the misogynist practice. Though nuclear families, intercaste marriages and police intervention seem to have helped, the figures may not be an accurate representation of the ground reality as some cases still go unreported due to family pressure and social stigma. On the flip side, the anti-dowry law can be a double-edged sword, giving women the scope to misuse it for personal vendetta. While a thorough investigation can help police identify genuine cases, a change in mindset will go a long way in eradicating the menace.Additional director general of police (law and order) Kamal Pant said, “Most dowry harassment cases come from joint families. Women complain against in-laws, sisters-in-law and brothers-in law. Often, the husbands wouldn’t have demanded anything. But others would have tortured the women. Now, nuclear families are increasing and mostly, both husband and wife work.”“Intercaste and interfaith marriages also contribute to the dip. As the marriages would have happened as a matter of choice, the question of dowry doesn’t arise,” he explained.Activists working to help women, however, feel the downtrend in the number of cases doesn’t mean atrocities against married women have reduced.Activists: Registration process delayed“The cases have reduced because women who come with complaints are being tired out due to police delaying the registration of cases. The Supreme Court has relaxed the law without it being amended. The relaxation is being misused by police, who want to do away with registering many cases,” claimed KS Vimala of Janawadi Mahila Sanghatane.However, legal practitioners say unlike earlier, police try to mediate in domestic discord cases and succeed in sending back aggrieved women without registering their complaints.Ambika S, an advocate dealing with dowry harassment cases, said, “Following Supreme Court guidelines, police take stock of the situation before deciding whether to register a domestic violence or dowry harassment case. Complainants who don’t have enough evidence are being sent back. In other cases, police, in good faith, try to reconcile the fighting couple.”Ambika said the dowry menace is still rampant but has acquired different forms like demands for cars, land or even a government job.Activists fighting for men’s rights have welcomed the decline but said women may use other criminal sections like rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act to seek vengeance against their husbands and in-laws.Kumar Jagirdar, a city-based activist for men’s rights, said, “Many dowry cases are to do with vengeance. Realizing that the section is being misused, the Supreme Court laid down guidelines directing police not to act hastily on complaints. But there are instances of women wanting a police case against their husbands and falsely accusing them of sexually assaulting or raping their minor daughter.”"

The incident occurred at around 3.15am on February 20 when three men in a speeding car pulled over outside a café. One of them, who was in the rear seat, drew out his weapon and opened fire at a delivery boy sitting on a chair. The bullet hit the chair, and luckily, no one was hurt. While this was a rare case when there has been a firing, violence at cafés and eateries operating round-the-clock in Jaipur isn’t an uncommon sight; drunken brawls and unruly, rude guests are often seen at such eateries during midnight when crowd gathers after drinking at pubs and clubs.‘PEOPLE THREATEN US BY CITING PERSONAL CONNECTIONS’Sonal Sajwan, food and beverage manager of the restobar Jaipur Adda in Bani Park, that stays open till 1.30-2am, says that while restros that are open till late, have open seating are favoured by customers, they become more accessible to all kinds of people, including miscreants and hooligans. “And you cannot stop someone from walking into your restaurant,” says Sonal. “We do face problems sometimes. At 1 or 2am, our restaurant is often full of guests who are under the influence of alcohol. They threaten us by citing personal connections saying things like, ‘Tu janta nahi mai kaun hoon’, when we ask them for payments. However, our staff is equipped to deal with such situations,” he shares.Eateries atSindhi Campthat stay open till late at night‘WE DEPLOY BOUNCERS AND SECURITY GUARDS TO HANDLE SUCH SITUATIONS’DND Bar and Lounge, situated on the rooftop of Hotel Maharani Prime, Sindhi Camp, is a well-known place where Jaipur’s youngsters, many of them having consumed alcohol, congregate to have food and an after-party of sorts. The place stays open till 6 in the morning. Owner Naveen Bacchani says, “Alcohol is often a key factor in the aggressive behaviour of guests. Not just with our staff, sometimes a violent brawl occurs among the guests themselves. Under the influence of alcohol, it takes no time for a usual verbal spat to escalate into a violent scuffle. On our part, we have installed CCTV cameras at our lounge and have deployed three bouncers and two security guards to tackle this growing problem. When the situation gets out of control, we call the police.”Naveen adds, “We also have some guests who refuse to pay the bill. Recently, we had a customer who came with one of his female friends late at night and both of them ordered drinks. While the female guest left early, the man stayed on for a while and placed an order for some more drinks and snacks. When we asked him for payment, he simply refused and became a bit aggressive with our staff. We had to take the help of the police in this case. We have a zero-tolerance approach towards people who don’t know how to behave.” He further informs that such problems happen mostly at roadside food outlets as compared to rooftops.‘ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS POINTED A GUN AT ME’Rajesh, owner of an eatery which is open till 6am at Sindhi Camp, shares, “There was an incident when one of the customers pointed a gun at me. Problems arise, especially during the weekend when there is a lot of rush. I have noticed that it is mostly the outstation people, settled in Jaipur either for studies or work, who often create troubles and misbehave with us. They live away from their parents. So, they think that they are free to do whatever they want.”He further adds, “I think police patrolling at regular intervals might help in curbing the situation. Even though my staff is trained in crowd management, they are not security.”‘CUSTOMERS HAVE PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED DELIVERY BOYS’Sabir Khan, help desk manager at Muhammadi Palace that stays open till 12-12.30am, says that it is mostly the young boys who misbehave. Also, incidents of violence are not just limited to the restaurant staff. It happens with the delivery boys as well. “We have had incidents where customers have literally snatched food from our delivery boys to avoid paying the money and physically assaulted them. According to our delivery boys, such customers are mostly drunk. At our restaurant, people under the influence of alcohol come and leave without paying the bill. When we try to stop them, they try to do dadagiri. We don’t go to the police because it is quite a hassle and might bring bad reputation to the restaurant. But violence at food outlets is definitely a matter of concern,” he says."

Shah harped on poverty in Bengal in the same vein, claiming that one in every five persons in the state is still living below poverty line.Raking up corruption issues during the UPA regime, Shah said: “The country needs a government ruled by leaders and not by dealers.”Taking a dig at the sales of paintings by chief ministerMamata Banerjee, Shah alleged that her paintings were bought by the ponzi firm owners. “How much do you think a painting can fetch? Thousands or lakhs may be. But Mamataji's paintings were sold for crores. All such paintings were bought by chit fund walas,” he said. He alleged that the ponzi firm owners who bought the paintings enjoyed immunity in the state.Blaming the Bengal government for renaming centrally-sponsored schemes and trying to take credit, the BJP president said, “The Centre sends the money for the Rs 2/kg rice that the poor people receive. Now, they are even depriving people by denying them healthcare facilities under centrally-sponsored schemes.”“Before the elections (Assembly polls), TMC had promised to reopen 55,000 closed factories in the state. How many of them have been reopened? Instead, bomb-making units have mushroomed across the state,” he said. Pointing at the “growing infiltration” in Bengal, Shah said Trinamool must clarify its position on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. “If voted to power, we will make arrangements for refugees (Hindu refugees) in the state,” he added.Claiming that BJP will win at least 23 Lok Sabha seats from Bengal, Shah said people were waiting for change. “If voted to power, we will take Bengal back to its old glory and create a Sonar Bangla under Narendra Modi’s leadership.” Slamming the Ponzi muddle in the state, Shah said Ponzi firms have looted at least 25 lakh poor investors. “We will return the money to the poor investors,” Shah said.Reacting to the clashes, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “When our supporters were returning from the rally, they were attacked by TMC activists. This is a shame. We condemn it.”Trinammol’s retort came quick. “BJP workers attacked our party offices and this led to retaliation by our workers. If our party office is attacked, are we going to offer sweets?” Suvendu, also the state transport minister, said. He alleged that BJP was trying to disturb peace and stability in the district."

People demanding Reservation must reflect on the moral and ethical dimensions of the problem.”Jayaprakash said that, while there was one section in the country that wanted to extend the benefits of Reservation, while there was another that wanted to put an end to the practice once and for all. “The claim that Reservation is restricted to people from a few castes is false, it is extended to vulnerable sections across the social spectrum including physically-challenged people, etc., based on the proportion of their population,” said Jayaprakash.Pointing to the Dalits continuing to be on the margins of society, Jayaprakash said, “This indicates the persistence of the caste system. Reservation must continue till there is caste.”Political scientist HM Rajashekar called caste a societal ‘malaise’. “Caste has been used by leaders for political mileage. Parties coming to power must focus on providing employment to youngsters,” he said.Special officer for Raichur University Muzaffar Asadi said that the caste system was more prevalent, and deeply entrenched in rural areas than it was in cities. “A Dalit is killed every hour in the country. There are many temples that Dalits are not allowed entry to, and they are banned from drawing water from wells. Reservation must continue till there is caste-related violence,” said Asadi.Head of UoM’s political science department Krishna Hombal, and Prof GT Ramachandrappa participated in the seminar."

The Marathas maintain that it was Shivale-Deshmukh alias Bapuji Buva and his wife Padmavati who had performed the last rites.On December 29, 2017, a dispute arose between the Dalits and Marathas in the village over removal of a controversial board put up the previous night near Govind Gopal Gaikwad's samadhi. ""There was a gathering of about 1,000 people, including 40-50 Dalit men and women, who were abusing the villagers and threatening that they will see us on January 1,"" Dabhade deposed.The Pune rural police had arrested Dabhade and six others on December 29, 2017 under theScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes(Prevention of Atrocities) Act following an FIR registered over the dispute.All of them were later released by a court on a conditional bail. Later, Dabhade filed an affidavit before the probe commission, stating among other things, that the contents of the board were ""disputable, false and misleading""."

She has sought that the details of these officers be made available in the public domain so that they were accessible to any aggrieved woman.“It has come to my notice that in most states, officers of other departments are given this responsibility as an additional charge. Considering the practical situation of how feasible it is for a woman to come out of her home to register a complaint, it is important that we appoint more protection officers,” Gandhi said. The Minister has also written that a separate budget be allocated for the smooth functioning of protection officers, providing support to survivors, capacity building for staff and for generating awareness.“Every woman has the right to lead a life free from violence. I urge you to personally initiate action to preventviolence against womenand ensure protection of the rights of women through effective implementation of the Act,” Gandhi added.

Zimbabwe President to investigate 'unacceptable' violence by security forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/zimbabwe-president-to-investigate-unacceptable-violence-by-security-forces/articleshow/67645709.cms,"Zimbabwe protest,Zimbabwe,World Economic Forum,robert mugabe,Emmerson Mnangagwa","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-67646104,imgsize-190524,width-400,resizemode-4/67646104.jpg","HARARE:ZimbabwePresidentEmmerson Mnangagwaon Tuesday said ""unacceptable"" violence by security forces will be investigated after a days-long crackdown on economic unrest, while a doctor said the 12 documented deaths and more than 300 people wounded are likely ""are just a fraction of the actual victims.""President Emmerson Mnangagwa called for a national dialogue among political parties and civic leaders, even as arrests continued. He spoke after skipping a visit to theWorld Economic Forumin Davos, Switzerland under pressure to return home.Zimbabwe's military is in the streets for the first time since post-election violence in August killed six people. This time, people report being hunted down in their homes. More than 600 people have been arrested, most denied bail.The ""army is on the forefront of orchestrating the violence,"" backed by ruling ZANU-PF youth gangs and police, Dr Norman Matara, with the Zimbabwe association of doctors for human rights told reporters in Johannesburg.The pattern of injuries seen in the more than 300 people wounded and 12 dead suggested premeditation and training in torture, Matara said, and ""we think these numbers are just a fraction of the actual victims"" as some were too scared to seek treatment.Several people were dragged from their hospital beds and arrested. Some were shot in the head at close range and died. About half of those wounded were bystanders hit by stray bullets when the military opened fire on crowds. The group documented abuse of people as young as 9.Some medical professionals, accused of ""trying to subvert the government"" by publicizing the toll, are now afraid to help victims, Matara said.Zimbabwe's president said insubordination will not be tolerated and ""if required, heads will roll.""He defended, however, the dramatic fuel price increase that began the unrest by making gasoline in Zimbabwe the most world's expensive. Authorities said it was aimed at easing the demand that created miles-long lines as gas stations.But Zimbabweans who had seen no improvement in the collapsed economy under Mnangagwa, who took office in 2017 after the ouster of longtime leaderRobert Mugabe, lost their patience. Activists and labor leaders called for people to stay at home in protest. Others took to the streets, some looting in anger or desperation.Mnangagwa's government has blamed the opposition, despite witness accounts of security forces killing or wounding bystanders, including a 17-year-old.""Everyone has the right to protest, but this was not a peaceful protest,"" Mnangagwa said.The government-backed Zimbabwe human rights commission said eight people were killed and criticized the use of the military and live ammunition. It said the government had not learned from the August crackdown, and should compensate ""victims of military and police brutality.""Mnangagwa has previously said he is open to dialogue with the main opposition MDC party, which narrowly lost both the July election and a court challenge alleging fraud. He has dismissed a government of national unity.The opposition called Mnangagwa's new call for dialogue a ""gimmick to buy time.""""Mnangagwa's overtures are always on Twitter. He knows where we are, yet he has chosen not to talk to us directly,"" MDC spokesman Jacob Mafume said.MDC leader Nelson Chamisa said his attempts at dialogue had been ""spurned and mocked"" and that people must be free to talk without fear.Zimbabwe lawyers for human rights said police detained labor federation leader Japhet Moyo overnight, just hours after releasing him. He is charged with subversion for his role in organizing the national strike along with pastor and activist Evan Mawarire.Police also detained 28 people being treated at a hospital in the capital, Harare, the lawyers' group said, calling it ""very inhumane.""Zimbabwe's government ordered an internet blackout in recent days as reports of abuses emerged, but the high court on Monday ordered that full service be restored, saying only the president has the authority to order it.At Davos, Mnangagwa had planned to appeal for foreign investment and loans but faced a more difficult reception than a year ago, when optimism was relatively high about a ""new Zimbabwe."" Neighboring South Africa recently turned down Mnangagwa's request for a $1.2 billion loan.South Africa is now considering a bailout for Zimbabwe ""as long as it is affordable for our side,"" foreign minister Lindiwe Sisulu said. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa again suggested that US and other sanctions on Zimbabwe be lifted or relaxed.Zimbabwe finance minister Mthuli Ncube told The Associated Press in Davos that ""we don't need to be told by anyone that we need to do better on human rights or open up democratic space ... we need to do it for ourselves."" He hopes to gain access to some $500 million in lines of credit at Davos.Zimbabwe's turmoil again brought questions about tensions between Mnangagwa and the man he had left in charge, hard-line vice-president Constantino Chiwenga, who had led the military effort to oust Mugabe.Mnangagwa and Chiwenga have dismissed reports of a rift, and they hugged upon the president's return late Monday.""This is state-sponsored violence,"" Dewa Mavhinga, the southern African director for Human Rights Watch, told reporters. He called Mnangagwa's government the same as that of Mugabe but with ""an even more brazen system in charge."""

Look at the number of vigilante justice cases coming up. See today’s paper. The front page is completely devoted to these news. Is this what we really wanted for our country? There are no quick fixes, I know. There are no easy solutions. But in my view, unless we have a no tolerance philosophy to this, this is not going to stop. It has to be zero tolerance. We cannot permit even a thought that would dilute the preambler and the constitutional imperatives.”Considering violence against women and children as common place is the most dangerous, justice Devan said while speaking at launch of advocate Kaleeswaram Raj’s book ‘Indian Bharanakhadana: Paadangal; Padabhedangal’.“Some recent events that have happened which draw into focus misogynistic violence really pains us because we are not concerned about the persons involved, we are not concerned whether the persons involved are guilty or otherwise, because it doesn’t matter. They might as well be innocent tomorrow after trial, we don’t care. But the fact that we are able to take it something that is tolerable or condonable, for any reason, that hits the death knell on our constitutional imperatives. We cannot even show an indication, we cannot even whisper that such tendencies can even be considered to be tolerable or condonable. It doesn’t matter whether it restricts the rights of individuals. As a nation, as a community, it is upon us to ensure that each of us act within that limits of the constitutional parameters and no such event, especially misogynistic violence and attack against children, are considered common place,” justice Devan stated.Commenting on the mob-lynch mentality setting in in the society, media veteran Sashi Kumar said, “The Constitution is also challenged also because of the peculiarity of our times – lynch-mob mentality. We find the extra-constitutional at a premium today. We find the extra-legal at a premium today. A film is released not because it gets a certificate by the statutory authorities or by censor certificate but because certain pressure groups will decide whether the film will run or not. And if they decide it will not run, it will not run. It’s decided on the street. We have seen similar situations. We have seen the idea of a katta panchayat becoming the norm across the country. Recourse to proper legal mechanisms seem to be pushed to the margins. The law of the street seems to prevail. And these are, I think, dangerous omens for our constitutional scheme of things as well.”The situation is such that those who exercise their right to speech and expression have to forfeit their right to life, Sashi Kumar said. “We have a situation where if you exercise your rights under Article 19 1 (a) and (g) – your right of freedom of speech and expression – whether as a citizen or as a derived right which we practitioners of the press follow, you are in danger of forfeiting your right under Article 21. In other words, if you exercise your right of freedom of speech under Article 19, you forfeit your right under Article 21, which is right to life, as Gauri Lankesh and Shantanu and many other journalists – about 9 or 10 journalists in recent times – starkly remind us. So these glaring contradictions in the Constitution are now for the first time staring us in the face in the manner that it is today,” he stated.Justice AK Jayasankaran Nambiar, who released advocate Kaleeswaram Raj’s book ‘Rethinking Judicial Reforms: Reflections on Indian Legal System’, said those criticizing judgments should assume the role of a dissenting judge. “If you are commenting upon a judgment, put yourselves in the shoes of a judge who is deciding that case and try to find an alternate view to the majority or to the judgment which you are criticizing. That ensures two things – it keeps you within the arena of the judgment or it keeps you within the scope of the topic and it also serves to help you or it guides you in the distinction that you want to make with the point that has already been taken by the person who has authored the judgment,” he said."

Since such extreme behaviour indicated a high degree of disorder and was difficult to cure through treatment, the students should be kept under life-long monitoring, they advised.It was shocking that these youngsters were training to be nurses — a profession that requires compassion and kindness, said psychiatrist J Ram. “It was a case of planned, ruthless murder and their behaviour bordered on sadism. This shows that they have complete disregard for the well-being of animals around them. It raises questions about their feelings for fellow humans as well. They have no moral values either. It is ironical and indeed sad that they were going to become nurses,” said Ram.The condition that these nurses have is also known as ‘anti-social personality disorder’, added the psychiatrist. “Usually, these people have a long history of cruel behaviour. Often, there are enough indications but they are ignored. Such behaviour indicators start showing up in adolescence and remain dormant unless a situation arises that exposes the condition,” added Ram.Nurses’ organizations condemned the act and agreed that the accused needed treatment. “This is not normal behaviour and these youngsters should be put through counselling. But it must also be noted that these students were driven to despair by these stray dogs that had become a menace on campus. The students had lodged several complaints with the authorities but no step was taken,” said Parbati Pal of Nurses Unity.This violent behaviour was also a result of the endorsement of aggression and intolerance by the society at large, said psychiatrist Siladitya Ray.“While a section of the society has turned extremely conscious ofanimal rightsand the need to protect endangered species, there is perhaps a growing section that remains intolerant towards animals. There is now a tendency to glorify aggression in entertainment and sports. The ruthlessness with which the puppies were killed is frightening. These offenders suffer from a serious personality disorder and should be put through counselling before being allowed to resume normal activities,” Ray said.“It is distressing but true that people who display such heartless behaviour towards animals would also be cruel towards humans. If these offenders were indeed nursing students, the authorities should consider if they are fit to join the profession,” he added.Sociologist Prashanta Roy said this macabre action showed that there was a deep-seated angst and pent-up frustration ready to overflow at the slightest trigger. “There are negative emotions in every human being and most of the time we try to control them with civil behaviour. It’s a kind of sophistication that we deliberately put on because we do not want to show our basic instincts to people. But there is a deep-seated angst building up inside each of us because of the turbulent times we are in,” said Roy."

In contrast, violent crime cases declined from 1,222 in 2016 to 910 in 2017 and further dipped to 842 in 2018. An analysis shows cybercrime cases were 40% less than violent crimes, but the gap narrowed by 5% in 2017, but surged ahead by 142% in the last calendar year.SSP Lucknow Kalanidhi Naithani said after demonetisation, more people began using e-wallets and debit, credit cards and became targets. The addition of 30% new users in the digital medium in 2017 also led to increase in cybercrime, he said.Independent cyber expert Adarsh Dubey, however, says increase in connectivity is not the sole reason. “Police force is poorly equipped. They still depend on old techniques of tracing IP address, then sending it to social media firms for tracing miscreants through ‘dark web’.Policemen are still unaware of crypto currency, block chain frauds and more such cases will be reported, he said."

They are trying to destroy the peace and tranquility of the state. We will take stong action against it. It's the RSS agenda to create fear in the minds of the people,"" Vijayan told reporters here, adding that it will not be allowed.He said people of the state have shown restraint.""The RSS workers were attacking houses of MLAs, and other leaders. Their only aim and route is violence. The law and order system of the state will take care of it,"" he said.Senior congress leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged the state police had failed to maintain law and order.""DGP himself has accepted this. Why has government failed to stop the BJP from creating violence?"" Chennithala asked.State minister and CPM leader G Sudhakaran courted controversy calling Sabarimala temple's Tantri (chief priest), a ""Brahmin monster"" for conducting a 'purification' ceremony after two women in the menstrual age group entered the shrine.Two women, Kanakadurga (44) and Bindu (42), entered the shrine and offered prayers on Wednesday, breaking a centuries-old tradition.Following this, the tantri, Kandaru Rajeevaru, closed the sanctum sanctorum to perform the 'purification' ceremony.In Delhi, BJP national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao hit out at the CPM state leadership and said the violence around the hill shrine was unleashed by the LDF government, which, instead of dealing with it in a sensible way, wreaked havoc, resulting in devotees being hurt and even killed.Meanwhile, Pathanamthitta district collector has extended prohibitory orders at Sabarimla till 'Makaravilakku' festival on January 14. Prohibitory orders were already imposed at various places in the state including Nedumangadu, Adoor, Pandalam, and Kodumon.As violence erupted, V Muraleedharan's ancestral home was attacked hours after bombs were thrown at the homes of Shamseer and Sasi when leaders of the Marxist party and BJP-RSS were attending a peace meeting here.The attacks, which disrupted normal life, marked return of political violence on large-scale after a gap of over a year in the sensitive district.Kerala has been rocked by violent protests by BJP-RSS and right wing outfits after two women of menstruating age offered prayers at the Ayyappa temple on January 2.As violence continued to disrupt life in Kannur and other places, state police chief Loknath Behera sounded a state-wide alert and gave direction to take stern action against those responsible for attacks on houses of party leaders.According to Behara, 1,286 cases have been registered till tonight and 3,282 people arrested in connection with the violent incidents since the January 3 hartal called against the entry of two women into the hill temple. Of the arrested, 487 have been remanded and 2,795 granted bail.A police release said patrolling and raids had been intensified across Kannur. Police carried out a route march Saturday morning in Thalassery, where 19 people had been arrested and 33 taken into preventive custody.Police said stone pelting incidents were reported against a march taken out by DYFI and BJP office in Kannur district this evening, but none was injured.It has been decided that no marches would be allowed to be taken out tonight and tomorrow, according to police.In another incident, miscreants set an office of theRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS) afire in Pariyaram area in the morning, police told PTI.A CPM worker was attacked at Perumbara in Iritty in the district last night while RSS leader K Chandrasekharan was assaulted in Thalassery and his house ransacked allegedly by around 25 Marxist workers.With the tension continuing, the CPM and BJP-RSS leaderships blamed each other for the violent attacks.CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan told reporters in Thiruvananthapuram that the RSS was trying to trigger riot in the state and sabotage peace talks.The RSS-BJP combine was turning temples and educational institutions managed by them as ""armoury"", he alleged, adding the ruling party would take the initiative to restore peace in violence-hit areas.Countering the charges, V Muraleedharan said the incidents of violence were the tactics of the ruling CPM to divert attention from the controversies and protests over the violation of the traditional customs at the Sabarimala temple.The entry of two women into the hill shrine on Wednesday, the first time since the Supreme Court in September last year lifted the age-linked ban on the entry of women devotees, has triggered massive protests in Kerala.Located in north Kerala, Kannur has been the hotbed of political violence especially between the CPM and BJP and witnessed bloody clashes and killings over the years.In Kannur district, 169 cases have been registered and 230 people arrested, while in Palakkad 166 cases have been registered and 298 people held, police said."

In a Kangaroo court-like situation, he is made to answer questions about his home and identity. As the 2.16 minute video progresses, a cacophony of voices is heard in the background with the alleged perpetrators calling Khan a terrorist “deserving of a befitting treatment”. As the mobile camera shifts to Khan’s pick-up van, six cows are seen tied in it. “Aap sabhi se niveden hai ki Gau mata ko jyada se jyada bachao, yeh bhaisab (Khan) se baat karwata hun,” the accused shooting the video is heard while Khan, trembling in fear and cold struggled to speak.The video came to fore recently following the arrest of five accused, three of whom were later released on bail. The incident occurred on Sunday when Khan and his friend Mushtaq were ferrying cows from Jaipur’s Shahpura to in Haryana.Khan in his statement to police “claimed” he was ferrying cows for slaughter. A criminal case was also registered against him under multiple sections of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995. A resident of Mirzapur in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district, Khan sustained injures but survived the frenzied mob’s wrath.While police are investigating the matter, the mob-justice menace continues without any immediate solution. The menace’s epicenter remains Alwar where such videos are shot and shared widely, encouraging others to take “resolute action” against cow smugglers.Since April 1, 2017, at least 15 such cases have been recorded, including the lynching of Pehlu Khan. On December 6, 2017, Rajsamand police had to block internet services after an accused identified as Shambhu Lal Raiger hacked a migrant laborer to death and recorded a video, which was watched by many who hailed him as a hero."

From coal mafia attacking RTI activist Agnes Khasiingh, Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) passing a bill depriving Khasi women of ST status if they marry non-tribals, an HC judge saying that India should have been declared a Hindu partition during Parition, Punjabi Lane clashes to 15 miners getting trapped in a flooded coal mine, the state has seen it all.Though the year started on a promising note with the youthful Conrad Kongkal Sangma taking over the reins from Mukul Sangma, the state first witnessed violence and then got entangled incontroversiesone after another as the year passed by.Punjabi Lane clashesIn June, clashes erupted when a bus driver and his friend were attacked in the Punjabi Lane area ofShillongfollowing an altercation with some residents of the area. As rumours of the assaulted victims dying in hospital spread on the social media, locals grouped together and went to attack the residents following which the entire area was put under curfew for over a month. Inter-city transport between Guwahati and Shillong was hit and internet services were also suspended to prevent futher escalation of the situation. Because of the curfew prices of essential commodities had skyrocketed, causing inconvenience to people. Earlier this week, the Pubjab cabinet had approved a proposal for providing Rs 60 lakh as compensation to the Sikh community against damage caused to their properties during violence in Shillong. But the Meghalaya government was unhappy with the decision saying that it would 'add more fuel to the fire' as the state government is trying to solve the issues amicably.RTI Activist AttackedRTI activist Agnes Kharshiing and her aide, Amita Sangma, were critically injured after they were attacked by a group of 30-40 people, led by suspected coal mafia, at Shohshrieh village in East Jaintial Hills district on November 8. The incident took place after the duo stopped by to take pictures of coal-laden trucks on the roadside. She had suffered five wounds in her head, a broken arm and was kept in hospital for two weeks. The state government paid for the medical expenses of both the activists following a high court order. Recently, the prime accused in the case, Nidamon Chullet, surrendered before the police in East Jaintia Hills district. Chullet is a leader of the ruling National People's Party. Another accused, identified as Cheerful K Ryngkhlem, has also surrendered. Earlier, police had arrested six persons in connection with the attack.Khasi Marriage BillThe Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) in July approved a bill that will debar a Khasi woman from Scheduled Tribe (ST) status and other privileges if she marries a non-Khasi. Describing the legislation as 'insensitive', Meghalaya state women's commission chairperson Theilin Phanbuh had said the KHADC should have arranged for a public debate on the issue before tabling the bill. ""The bill portrays a gender bias as as it talks only about women and chooses to remain silent about men who choose to marry a non-tribal woman."" Meghalaya is divided into three autonomous councils - Khasi, Jaintia and Garo. The anti-mixed marriage legislation will be applicable in the three districts of West Khasi Hills district, East Khasi Hills district and Ri-Bhoi districts.Hindu nation rowA judge of the Meghalaya high court recently sparked a controversy by saying that India should have declared itself a Hindu nation at the time of of the Partition. Justice SR Sen made this observation while disposing of a petition of one Amon Rana, who was denied domicile certificate by the state government. ""Pakistan declared themselves as an Islamic country and India, since (it) was divided on the basis of religion, should have also been declared as a Hindu country, but it remained as a country,"" Justice Sen said. Justice Sen, who is the lone judge at the Meghalaya HC, said ""I make it clear that nobody should try to make India as Islamic country, otherwise it will be a doom's day for India and the world. I am confident that only this government under PM Narendra Modi will understand the gravity, and will do the needful as requested above and our (West Bengal) chief minister Mamata Banerjee will suport the national interest in all respect."" Justice Sen has clarified that he never meant to challenge the country's secularism. ""Whatever is the truth, history and ground reality, on that basis I have written my judgment to save the citizens of India irrespective of caste, creed, religion or language and people should understand the history of India and live in peace and harmony.""He added, ""Secularism is one of the basic structures of our Constitution. It should not further be divided on the basis of religion, caste, creed, community or language... I would also like to clarify here that in my judgment, nowhere I have said anything against secularism and my judgment makes references to the history and one cannot change the history,"" he clarified. Justice Sen had also urged the Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers to introduce a law to grant unconditional citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhist, Parsis, Christians, Khasis, Jaintias and Garos from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan seeking refuge in India. ""I would like to make it clear that when I mentioned the government under Shri Narendra Modiji, it is inclusive of the Hon'ble ministers and Hon'ble members of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,"" Justice Sen stated. ""I also mention here that I do not belong to any political party nor have I got any dream to get any political berth after my retirement and neither is my judgment politically motivated or influenced by any part,"" he added.Clarifying his observation that Hindus and Sikhs were victims of Partition, he said, ""Their presence in India is primarily due to the religious persecution that they have been facing through generations and nobody can deny that... We should remember that whatever we call influx or foreigner, that is due to Partition without proper referendum and wrong boundary demarcation and mainly on religious persecution.""As for his suggestion on extension of unconditional citizenship to minorities from neighbouring countries, he said, ""It is not uncommon to find people living in India for generations and yet having no proper documentation. It would be inhumane to uproot them and displace them once again.""Mine TragedyFifteen miners are trapped inside a 370-foot-deep illegal coal mine in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills district since December 13 after water from a nearby river gushed in, puncturing the mine wall. Indian Navy divers on Monday entered the flooded mine and said the search would be feasible only after the water level inside the shaft is reduced to a safe diving limit of 30 metres. On the 18th day of the operation, the Navy divers stayed inside the shaft for three hours with a hi-tech gadget, Under Water Remotely Operated Vehicle, and found visibility to be very poor - only one foot. According to the Navy, all precautions are being taken to ensure that divers do not suffer from decompression sickness, which is usually experienced in a compressed environment as that of the mine in Lumthari village.National Disaster Response Force, Air Force, Coal India Limited, Odisha Fire Services and some other agencies are assisting in rescue work."

Some times Ajay Kumar Bisht's government seeks praise for itself, at other times it says it was a conspiracy.""A ""mobocracy"" has prevailed in the country since the formation of the BJP government at the Centre, he alleged.""Earlier someone else was accused, now someone else is the culprit. The people whose names are coming out (in the investigation) are those who are close to the BJP leaders there,"" he claimed.His remarks come a day after a court sent to 14-day judicial custody the man who allegedly shot dead Singh.Prashant Nat was not named in the FIR but was held based on local intelligence, eyewitness accounts and assessment of the video footage that was gathered, Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police (SSP) Prabhakar Chaudhary had said.Slamming theYogi Adityanathgovernment over inaction, Babbar said: ""Ajay Singh Bisht had assured the family of the police inspector that they will get justice. He had called them. In all religions when someone dies, people go to their home, but here he called them.""""Will there be justice done... in today's circumstances, it doesn't look like,"" he said.The Congress party wants that considering the circumstances prevailing in UP, there should be a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge, he said.Asked at what level the inquiry should be conducted, Babbar said it would be preferable that it is done under the supervision of the Supreme Court, but added that a probe under the UP chief justice would also bring out the truth.Alleging that UP was moving towards ""anrachy"", Babbar asked that should such a government continue.He also slammed the UP government over FIR being filed on court orders against theUnnaorape victim, her mother and an uncle for allegedly producing a forged age certificate to prove she was a minor."

I shouted and asked my family members to close the doors immediately. Suddenly, many of them jumped into my house. What I went through at that time cannot be put into words.

They saw people being killed. “I saw two women Dera followers pelting stones at houses and security personnel shot them down after warning them. I could not believe it was all real,” said Sector 2 resident Urmil Kaswan, 52.Trying to escape the police, the mob tried to use residents as cover. “Ten people knocked the door of my house and asked for help. They wanted to hide inside my house to escape the police. I refused and closed the gate. They got enraged and tried to break my front door. But the police and paramilitary forces stopped them. My family was in shock after this,” said Rajesh Kaushal, a local trader and resident of Sector 4.Up to this day, Panchkula residents wonder why Dera followers were allowed to gather in the city when Section 144 had been imposed. A few retired Army personnel from Sector 2 said Dera followers were more organized than security forces.“They used to wake up at 4am and tea was served to them. Food came on time on all three days. They formed lines and moved together every day,” they recalled.Besides damaging property, Dera followers also damaged the city’s green cover and parks by open defecation. “I stopped a Dera follower from urinating behind my house on Friday morning. He called other followers and the group threw a stone at my house, breaking a window. They told me to keep quiet and stay inside,” said Colonel B N L Kaushal (Retd), 75, a resident of Sector 2.Confined to their houses and surrounded by mobs, Panchkula residents clicked photographs and made videos of the violence. Later, police took the help of photographs taken by locals, mediapersons and their own professional photographers to identify criminals.After the violence, residents of Sector 2 built strong metal gates at all entry and exit points of their sector."

A cop and a youth had lost their lives in the violence that ensued in the communally sensitive west UP district earlier this month over alleged incident of cow slaughtering.Yogi's fresh statement came a week after he termed the Bulandshahr incident an 'accident'. On Wednesday, Yogi said that violence in Bulandshahr was a 'political conspiracy' hatched by those who could not face their opponents and were losing political ground in the state and were trying to forge an alliance against the BJP.""Jo log danga karana chahte the...gaukashi karke arajakta failana chahte the unko benaqab kiya hai...(Cow slaughtering was deliberately done to spark communal violence in the region. The state government has exposed the conspiracy behind the incident),"" the CM said, a day after police arrested three persons on charges of cow slaughtering in Bulandshahr. ""The conspiracy had been hatched by the same people who were found accused in manufacture of illicit liquor that claimed lives of people,'' he said.Yogi's statement came soon after a a belligerent opposition staged a raging protest in the Vidhan Sabha as well as the Vidhan Parishad, disrupting their proceedings while demanding an answer from the ruling BJP over Bulandshahr incident. The CM said the opposition was attempting to cover its failure by hatching conspiracy to malign the image of the state government. He said that the UP government had ensured security in the state because of which investments were pouring in.The opposition parties, including SP, BSP and Congress countered CM's charges saying that they wanted a discussion on Bulandshahr incident in the state assembly. SP's Iqbal Mahmood, who held the charge of leader of opposition in the absence of Ram Govind Chaudhary, said the ruling BJP had completely failed on the law and order front and was therefore digressing from key issues. He said that a notice was served to the assembly speaker Hriday Narain Dixit to take up discussion on Bulandshahr incident. ""But it never happened,"" he said.BSP legislative party leader, Lalji Verma questioned as to why the Bulandshahr incident was earlier called an 'accident'. He said that the incident was a handiwork of organisations likeBajrang Dalwhich is affiliated to the BJP. Incidentally, police had registered an FIR naming Bulandshar's Bajrang Dal convener, Yogesh Raj. ""Communal riots are being orchestrated in the name of cow slaughter. That is why we demanded a discussion in the house,"" Verma said."

The order was passed by the court after examining the record of other persons who have been permitted to avail the facility inside the jail by the jail administration.The HC, however, has imposed certain conditions for Honeypreet to avail the facility.The socially adopted daughter of Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim had approached the HC against the decision of jail department Haryana in this regard.Honeypreet is lodged inAmbala jailsince October 3, 2017 in connection with her role in thePanchkula violenceand related cases.According to Honeypreet, in view of various jail reforms, prison inmate calling system (PICS) facility was introduced throughout the country and the same was also introduced in Haryana. As per the system, every prisoner lodged in the prison is allowed to hold telephonic conversation with his family members, friends, and relatives for five minutes every day.Appearing for Honeypreet, advocate Vinod Ghai had argued that the director general of prisons had issued directions for providing the PICS facility after verification of phone numbers provided by the prisoners.""The phone numbers provided by the prisoners are verified and thereafter this facility is provided for making calls only on the verified numbers.

The BBFC said it also wanted its ratings to appear on all streaming services.Among those films that would have been impacted by the update are 2008's Keira Knightley-starring period drama 'The Duchess', classified as a 12 at the time despite containing a rape scene.According to the BBFC website, public consultation - involving more than 10,000 people - showed that young people and parents want to see an increase in classification guidance, particularly around online content, as well as more consistency across all platforms, with 97 per cent of people saying they benefit from age ratings being in place. 91 per cent of people (and 95 per cent of teenagers) want consistent age ratings that they recognise from the cinema and DVD to apply to content accessed through streaming services.David Austin, Chief Executive Officer at the BBFC, took to their website and said, ""Over the last five years the way we consume film and video has changed beyond all recognition. That's why it's so important that there is consistency between what people watch on and offline. The research shows that parents and teenagers want us to give them the information and guidance that they need to view what's right for them.""The new guidelines will come into force on Feb. 28, 2019."

People in both Narkeldanga, where Ashiq lives, and Phoolbagan areas think there is an urgent need for rational and logical sense to prevail. The locals in both areas admitted thatrumourswere snowballing and such incidents were a reaction to that.Ashiq, who is critical and is admitted to a nursing home off EM Bypass, was apprehended by the locals in the Harijan settlements in the Dompara area on Friday. Residents said that when asked about his identity, he could not say anything. Some of the men who had gathered at the spot mistook him for a child trafficker and started beating him up. On Saturday,17 people were arrested.“We have never faced such trouble in the past, nor have we heard of such an incident in the locality,” said Mamata, wife of Kailash Das who was picked up by cops on Saturday. The wife of another person who was taken in by the police, Guriya Das, said, “My husband Sanjay works as a daily wage labourer. Now that he is in custody, there is nobody to support the family. I wish there was no trouble that day,” she said.In Narkeldanga, Ashiq’s family was distraught, trying to get updates on his health on a regular basis. Ashiq works at a bangle manufacturing unit and takes care of his mother’s treatment. “He has never worn aburqabefore. But suddenly on Friday, he vanished after jumma namaz. Later, the police came to inform us about the incident,” said his brother.The video, in which Ashiq was seen being beaten up mercilessly, had gone viral in the thickly populated neighbourhood. “They hit his head with a stone. We have never seen such madness in people. The rumours of child traffickers has gained traction in our locality too. But one must apply logic before resorting to violence,” said Md Raju, Ashiq’s friend. “The police asked us to stay calm and assured us of all help,” he added."

The court, though, said that since the case invites a 10-year punishment, the accused needed to approach a higher court to seek bail.Lawyers representing the two sides confirmed the development and stated that though the submission did not directly refer to withdrawal of the case, the wording indicated that the matter had been “amicably settled” out of court. Sources indicated that the divorce between the two sides is likely to be the major point of discussion. The development came on the day the complainant was scheduled to record her statement before the magistrate.The development has left cops in a spot of bother with questions being raised on their line of action in the future. For now, the investigators insisted the probe would continue. Police sources said they were looking into a number of aspects, including the counter charges against the complainant and the contents of the divorce petition.The jewellers’ family had, from the beginning, claimed the woman had lodged the complaint as a “pressure tactic” to ensure the divorce case filed by her would get stronger."

Veeru, his wife Sunita and son Akash had been stabbed a day earlier. While Sunita succumbed to her wounds on Wednesday evening, Veeru lost the battle for life early Thursday morning. Their son Akash is still holding on to life but barely.Deputy Commissioner of Police (west) Monika Bhardwaj said the assailant Mohammad Azad was tracked down to Karampura Industrial Area on Thursday morning and arrested. This happened after Sunita and Veeru’s eight-year-old daughter, Lado, and 12-year-old son, Aman, told the police all that transpired on Wednesday between their family and Azad.“My mother was to come home with some sweets but uncle (Azad) attacked her with a knife,” recalled Lado while still wondering where her parents were. She is an eyewitness.Lado said Azad was standing at the corner of their street where he elbowed her mother Sunita. That led to an altercation. She said Azad would often threaten them from his balcony. “He abused my mother following which Akash went outside. My mother asked me to get her cellphone so that she could call up the police. Hearing this, he went inside his house and returned with a knife and attacked my mother and brother,” Lado said.Sonia, a neighbour of the family, said four other neighbours who tried to intervene were threatened by Azad.“He first stabbed Akash in the stomach. He tried to evade him by running out of the lane but fell on a cart. When Sunita tried to confront him, Azad slashed her throat. My sister-in-law tried to intervene but he was seething with rage and tried to attack her as well. Later, Veeru came out and Azad stabbed him multiple times before walking away,” said Sonia. She added that she closed the door to save herself, but came out again when she heard Veeru’s cries. He had been stabbed in the stomach and abdomen several times, and he was asking for water as he lay in a pool of blood.Lado’s elder brother, Aman, said his elder sister Khushboo (18) is six months’ pregnant and shut herself in the house to stay alive. The boy recalled that Azad had been threatening his whole family for the past few months after a soft drink bottle had accidentally fallen near his house.“Lado dropped the bottle accidentally, but it fell near Azad. There was an argument after that. Since then, he would openly threaten us and even stare at us through his balcony,” Aman said.Neighbours also echoed the family’s views, stating that Azad was short-tempered and would frequently get into arguments. On Wednesday night, there were two wedding celebrations in the lane and the loud music suppressed the noise of the argument.After the attack, Azad walked to the industrial area where he worked as a mechanic with the knife still in his hand and tried to hide at a few workshops. He also contacted a few co-workers to help him. Then he decided to flee Delhi. He threw away the murder weapon and also changed his clothes, but before he could go, he was arrested. Police said his using his cellphone at night gave his location and CCTV footage from around the crime scene helped police get a visual ID of him.Azad confessed to having attacked the family over a petty tiff. Police also found that a relative had slapped a case of sexual harassment against him. His wife had filed for divorce because of domestic violence, and they lived separately: he alone on the ground floor of their house, she with her two children on the first floor.For over 18 years, Azad worked as a mechanic in Saudi Arabia.A year ago, Khyala was witness to a similar incident barely a kilometre away at Raghubir Nagar in which a budding photographer was murdered in full public view by the family of his girlfriend. Locals said the police weren’t doing enough to stop illegal activities."

The cops had earlier even proposed to file untraced reports in these cases.The SIT, set up on August 17, 2017, has approached local magistrates in several cases for permission to conduct polygraph test of the suspects that it has identified.A weapon missing from the Meham police station and some mobile phones allegedly stolen from shops in Rohtak during the February 2016 agitation have also been recovered, according to details provided to the division bench headed by Punjab and Haryana high court Chief Justice Krishna Murari on Tuesday by the SIT chief and senior IPS officer Amitabh Singh Dhillon in a status report on his investigation till December 31, 2018.The SIT, which functions independently and reports to the high court only, was constituted by the HC after observing that the Haryana police had concluded that a majority of the cases registered for violence were of non-serious nature.Four units of the SIT, headed by SP-rank IPS officers Manisha Chaudhary, Pratiksha Godara, Ganga Ram Punia and Waseem Akram, are investigating 600 of the 1,105 cases, Dhillon revealed in his report. The members of the SIT have been directed to peruse the Prakash Singh committee report on Jat reservation to see if it offered any information that could be used in identifying suspects/culprits.Eleven suspects have been identified for their alleged involvement in causing damage and arson at Budhwar Car Pvt Ltd Rohtak. All cars parked in the car distribution agency were set on fire causing Rs 32 crore damage, as claimed by the owner. The SIT has identified the suspects from video footage and photographs.The tower dump data is being scrutinized to ascertain if the mobile phone numbers used by any of the suspects at the time of the incident were present at or near the place of occurrence.Similarly, the SIT arrested a suspect allegedly involved in stealing weapons from Meham police station in Rohtak district and a pistol has also been recovered.A copy of the status report was handed over to the high court by additional advocate general Haryana Pawan Girdhar on behalf of the SIT chief. Senior advocate Anupam Gupta, assisting the high court as amicus curiae in the matter, however, asked for time to examine the report so that he could address the court on the issue.‘Enhanced claims by victims likely’The SIT has expressed apprehension that some of the victims/complainants might have made false claims about stolen/damaged items, especially computers or mobile phones, from their shops damaged during the violence. “Incredibly enough, the complainants/victims are unable to provide information of even the shop from where the electronic items were purchased by them. The conduct does create suspicion that theft, looting/damage of expensive electronic items may have been included in the complaint by some of the victims to claim enhanced compensation from the government,” the report submitted to the high court said.‘No information despite reward’The SIT claimed that photographs of suspects were published in newspapers along with reward of Rs 10,000 for any information about them. However, no one came forward with any information till date."

The presidential candidate, Tripathi, got injured and has been taken to a hospital.According to Prashant Mukherjee, state secretary, SFI, “Students of NSUI attempted to kidnap and mob lynch Tripathi. Theattackwas led by Pradeep Vijayran, former NSUI candidate for DUSU president post, and aspiring candidate, Akash Chaudhary. SUVs with goons were brought outside the conference hall to kidnap Tripathi to prevent him from filing his nomination.”He added that the attack was motivated by the current NSUI candidate, Akash Choudhary, who sent his goons to kidnap him. “When police arrived, university officials attempted to call the assault a fight between two students’ organisations, whereas open threats were given to kidnap and kill him,” said Mukherjee.A senior NSUI member said two candidates had a verbal spat because they had the same name and that often creates confusion during elections. However, an official statement of NSUI said the issue was between two students and NSUI is not involved.When contacted, DUSU election committee refused to comment."

Speaking exclusively to TOI for the first time after December 3 violence, the DGP also questions constant focus on the organisations whose members were involved in the violence. ""One of the accused Jeetu is fromIndian Army. Are we highlighting its name?"" he asks. Excerpts...Q. How close are you in cracking the case? And what is the update on the prime accused who are linked to various right wing outfits?A. Investigations are on. We have already arrested eight persons. Besides, those responsible for dereliction of duty have also been transferred. We are committed to put every responsible person for the violence behind the bars.Q. Police have been shying away from naming and calling out the right wing organisations behind the Bulandshahar violence? Was this purposely done to shield cow vigilantes?A. I fail to understand why the entire focus is centered around which organisations the accused belong to? The FIR was filed by police and after going through circumstantial evidence, 27 men were named as accused. We have not withdrawn a single name and we are seriously committed to arrest each one of them irrespective of the organisation they belong to. Now, your question why are we so called averse in taking the name of the organisation. We have arrested Jeetu, so does that mean we should keep highlighting the name of the Indian Army? Even media is not doing that. We too haven't taken the name once because we are addressing his criminal act and not his association with any organisation. Then why the same logic is not being applied to other accused also? This is a wrong notion that police was trying to shield any one.Q. A police inspector was killed in the violence. ButMeerutIG was quoted in media saying, ""the bigger question is who slaughtered the cows"" and not about who were behind the violence? It clearly shows the priority.A. I still stand by the statement. There is a reason behind why it is a bigger question. We have seen a pattern in the past which is disturbing. Let me remind you that during Kanwar Yatra, six incidents of cow slaughter were reported from Gulawati, Arania, Khurja and Aurangabad that involved 21 cows. Now when Tabligi Iztema was on, seven-eight cows are slaughtered. Do you see the pattern? And, here we are not talking about the normal cow slaughtering that keeps taking place all across the state which is either for livelihood or consumption. There is difference here. Why such a large number of cow carcasses are found when some huge religious event is taking place? That is what is our biggest worry. Can you even imagine what could have been the repercussion had the Syana violence turned into a full-scale communal violence? At least give UP police thecreditfor preventing unprecedented scale of communal riots that could have ended the lives of at least a thousand people in Bulandshahr had we not acted swiftly. That is why we say it is a bigger question who is behind the cow slaughter in Syana in particular. This is a conspiracy that we need to expose.Q. Prime accused Yogesh Raj has released a video claiming innocence. The other accused Shikhar Agarwal is giving interviews on channels. Both are absconding. This certainly poses a question mark on UP police' intentions when it comes to arrests?A. We cannot brief media about the stage of investigations on a moment-by-moment basis. We are at it and let me assure you that all accused will be in police's net. No one will be spared. For your information, let me tell you the last location of Yogesh Raj was found in Nepal. We are moving and we are moving fast. Eight persons are already in jail and we are tracking the rest. Many things cannot be brought out in public domain because of the confidentiality required in investigations. But media must maintain some level of patience instead of jumping to conclusions.Q. Are you under pressure? Can you say that you are working completely independent of the political interference?A. We are certainly not under any pressure whatsoever. Can't you see the independent working of our investigators?Q. Trigger-happy cops have been carrying out encounters in the state in the name of police crackdown. But there ae times when they go overboard. Recently, a 20-year-old boy with no previous criminal record was shot in the head for transporting animals. Almost half a dozen NHRC notices have been slapped on the UP police in various cases of alleged fake encounters. Somewhere, the responsibility needs to be fixed.A. Whenever we have found any policeman involved in any misconduct, we have taken strict action. Immediately after Vivek Tiwari was shot by a constable in Lucknow, I had said my constable was a criminal and he would be arrested and dismissed from services. To add to that, we have terminated the services of a dozen policemen who were found to have tarnished the department's image. Several others have been suspended. We have issued strict guidelines to our field officers that any complaint of misconduct at their end will be dealt with strictly. Regarding crackdown, the only thing I can say is that there is a marked decrease of 44% in dacoity and 30% decrease in ransom-related crime from January 1 to October 31."

Instead of showing gratitude towards him as he tried to help police break the blockade set up by the villagers after the discovery of cow slaughter, they framed him in the case and made him the main accused. Police are just trying to defame Bajrang Dal and hide its own shortcomings in handling the crowd.""As per FIR, Raj claimed to have seen six people slaughtering a cow in a field next to the police outpost a day before violence. Out of four arrested, two, identified as Chaman and Devender, are Raj's relatives.Locally known as 'gau rakshak', Raj's house in the Naya Baans village is hard to miss.

The National Family Health Surveys have shown thatdomestic violenceaffects every third woman living in rural India.Data from FPAI’s clinics across Mumbai bear out the seriousness of the problem. Till September 2018, almost 28% of the 5,312 women who came to FPAI’s health clinics for medical help needed to be counselled about gender-based violence. “On talking to these women, we find that domestic violence could be at the root of their health problems and counsel them accordingly,” said a senior FPAI official. The corresponding numbers of 2016 and 2017 were 26% and 23% respectively.FPAI found that 29% of the 1.34 lakh women who sought medical help at its clinics running in 18 states in 2018 needed counselling for violence that they had faced.“Gender-based violence has a serious health implication on all women and more so on those in reproductive health age,” said Sangeeta Rege of CEHAT (Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes).Domestic violence is so widespread in the country, in fact, that a study carried out by Cehat in 2015-2017 found 16% prevalence of domestic violence faced by pregnant women.“This dispels the notion that pregnancy is a safe period for women,” said Rege. “The study highlighted that this prevalence is comparable to that two other big health problems for Indian women, that is gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, but it has not been given much attention.”The Cehat study also showed that advice offered to these women enabled them to stop violence in various ways, such as disclosing abuse to their parents. “These women also recognized the health impact of the violence and got doctors and nurses to speak to husbands/abusers about the impact of violence on their health,” said Rege.Numbers provided by theUnited Nations Population FundReport reveal that 66% of married Indian women have suffered from domestic violence, and as many as 70% of married women in India between the ages of 15 and 49 are subjected to beating, rape or forced sex, said Apte.FPA India recently launched a nationwide campaign #StreeHinsaMuktBharatAbhiyaan with the aim of “breaking the silence around gender-based violence” on the lines of an international campaign to challenge violence against girls and women.The marathon will be an effort to spread awareness about the need to talk and address the critical issue afflicting women."

Details in possession of TOI show that a total of 5782 calls were registered in Women Help Line (WHL-181) and out of these, 3742 were of women facing domestic violence at home.Ranga Reddy had highest number of cases referred at Sakhi centers with 901 cases, followed by Nalgonda with 458 cases. Among these, 79% of domestic violence cases are of women in the 18 -35 age group. About 19 % cases are of women of age between 36 - 60 and only two per cent of domestic violence cases are registered above 60 years of age.The centre say that in domestic violence, 75 percent of women seek reconciliation with family and husband. ‘They don’t want go to the extent of ending their marriage, with few seek legal support, but in most cases, husbands also come to terms that their family affairs are under scrutiny and cannot take their wives for granted,” an official said. In case of women above 45 years of age, they seek separation from the husbands.In case of women employees, the disputes are over women seeking their control on their own money. Such cases are referred to counsellers Officials say that more number of cases occur as women are more aware of support systems “Once they know support is provided, they open up, and we even provide shelter for ,women who are abandoned by the families,” Jagadeeswar M, principal secretary, women and child welfare department told TOI.At present, Sakhi is functioning (Karimnagar, Khammam, Mahabubnagar, Nalgonda, Nizamabad, Rangareddy, Sangareddy, Warangal urban and Adilabad).

The couple was in the midst of a separation case.Detective department officers indicated that they will now monitor the developments in the case that essentially will be handled by the southeast division police. Police sources said they were looking into a number of aspects — including the charges levelled against the woman and the actual contents of the divorce petition. “So far, prima facie, we are yet to establish anything that goes against the main ingredients of her core complaints,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.The police said they have recorded several statements in this regard. “We are going through them. Two statements are important here — the woman’s and her sister-in-law’s. The woman’s statement will be recorded at the earliest to ascertain the claims made by her in this case. We have made some progress on both fronts as the court has allowed our plea to get her statement recorded before a magistrate,” said an investigating officer.“Since there are certain aspects of rape and allegations of wife swapping, the statement of the sister-in-law is crucial,” said a source, adding that they were talking to the woman’s parents as well to ascertain if she had tried complaining earlier, especially after her daughter’s birth six years ago. The woman has moved police 13 years after her wedding.The jeweller’s family, though, has claimed it was a “pressure tactic” to ensure that the divorce case filed by the woman got stronger. The family also claimed that she had left her in-laws’ residence several months ago.“These are a set of lies to try and defame the family in an attempt to settle the divorce case in her favour,”said a family friend."

He was speaking at a book release function here.The judge said joint family system offered a mix of all human feeling and experiences and prepared youngsters for challenges in open society. A family busy with machines and social media platforms deprived children of fundamental values, said Justice Kirubakaran.Touching upon issues ranging from domestic violence to sexual harassment, as found in the book authored by lawyer A P Suryaprakasam, Justice Kirubakaran pointed out that involvement of women in crimes against women, particularly on issues involving dowry, was rampant.""I'm pained when women battling domestic issues tell me that the parents of their husband were the problem. Violence against women and children have gone up mainly because we lack love, affection and supervision of elders in families,"" he said.Instances of domestic and sexual harassment reflected personality disorder and psychological disorder, he said, adding that though India had the dubious distinction of having maximum number of persons with psychological disorders, the nation did not have enough counsellors and psychiatrists.“Only by making offenders suffer the pain by due process of law, we could deter such people from targeting children and women,” said Justice Kirubakaran.Criticising the state liquor policy, he said many families had been ruined by fresh availability of alcohol, which has damaged individual families as well as the society.Earlier, Justice (retd) K N Basha said he would get outraged at news of sexual harassment of children by people trusted by them, like teachers and relatives.Senior Congress leader and seasoned lawmaker Peter Alphonse said the functioning of the democracy was revolving around judiciary. “Judicial activism is an accepted reality now, and its role in moderating democratic institutions can't be undermined,” he said."

Apex court norms ignored as cow vigilantism raises its head in Alwar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/apex-court-norms-ignored-as-cow-vigilantism-raises-its-head-in-alwar/articleshow/67316129.cms,"Jaipur news, Jaipur latest news, Jaipur news live, Jaipur news today, Today news Jaipur, Mob Violence,Cow vigilantism,cow,apex court,Alwar","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-67318140,imgsize-262956,width-400,resizemode-4/67318140.jpg","JAIPUR: The Supreme Court on July 17, this year had given clear guidelines related tocow vigilantismto multiple states including Rajasthan. Coming down heavily on “horrendous acts of mobocracy,” theapex courthad warned of dire consequences against those who indulge inmob violence, yet nothing much has changed in the epicentre of problem —Alwardistrict.A few days after the court’s order, Alwar witnessed lynching of Rakbar Khan (31) in Lalawandi’s cotton fields on July 21, 2018. Senior officials then promised to swiftly implement a policy to curbcowvigilantes while also cracking a whip on smugglers. Despite much touted efforts like preparing a list of notorious smugglers, sniffing out suspicious vigilantes and highway patrol in cow smuggling prone areas, all efforts eventually petered out. Post July, there have been seven incidents of firing by cow smugglers on police, four incidents of seizures of beef packets and several arrests of alleged smugglers.TimesViewA new government taking charge in the state has not prevented cow vigilantes from running amok again. It is imperative that the government in co-ordination with the local administration implement guidelines set by the Apex court and plan out a policy to curb cow vigilantism immediately. The policy should not only nip vigilantism but also ensure strict punishment for those caught for the crime of smuggling. On its part, the local police should improve its intelligence wing, patrol local highways late at night and in the wee hours, and prevent instances of smuggling before the mob appears to ‘deliver justice’. That such vigilantism exists in the state despite a change in government is a pointer to criminal gangs still operating to spread hatred.So far as the court’s July 17 guidelines for lynchings to be nipped in the bud are concerned, directions for providing wide publicity to its directions of broadcasting that mob lynching would invite serious legal consequences are yet to be effectively complied with.Local officials, caught in cross-fire between vigilantes and smugglers, have come to admit that the problem has reached unimaginable proportions which defy any immediate solution. Clashes between smugglers, gau rakshaks and local police have not only increased, but have also become deadly. The smugglers now have modified trucks with heavy iron bars right above the bonnet, used as shield to break through police barricading. A total of 31 policemen have been injured in clashes in last three years and as many as nine suffered bullet injuries, a figure which is highest in Rajasthan.“Cattle smugglers, mostly from Haryana, pass through Alwar and Bharatpur pathways. Several of them are confronted by self-proclaimed vigilantes who now have their own network of informers ranging from fuel pump attendants, staff at local eateries and shop keepers, who quickly “report” suspicious vehicles to another legion of vigilantes. Most of these vigilantes’ groups consist of youths, who are tasked to carry out the “dirty job”- to thrash and beat anyone transporting cows,” an official told TOI.There have been multiple incidents of firing upon cops in Mewat. On August 22, Tijara police arrested three smugglers after a brief exchange of fire. On October 2, when a patrolling unit of Tijara police station intercepted an SUV car, the cops had to deal with intense firing from smugglers, eight cows were seized while smugglers fled.Barely a week after Tijara incident Alwar police asked their night duty officers to mount a strict vigil on Haryana border. During one of these night operations on October 9, Govindgarh police’s check-post at Naswari came under heavy fire from smugglers travelling in a mini-truck; eight cows were rescued after exchange of fire.These incidents failed to deter smugglers as again on October 13, a gang of smugglers fired at Tapukara police at a check post. Two smugglers were arrested and 39 cows were seized. In addition to these incidents, the police on October 28 seized 20 kg beef from a house in Tijara, on July 30, a unit raided a house in Govindgarh and seized 50 kg of beef.In August, the cops prepared a ist of 500 cattle smugglers wanted in different police stations, a majority of whom hail from Haryana, to keep a close check on their activities. The police had also begun collecting data on vigilantes preceded by station house officers of the 38 police stations in Alwar visiting villages under their jurisdictions."

He also promised a government job to Kidari’s second son and a house site for the family in Vizag. One member of Soma’s family will be given a government job, besides a house site in Vizag. He added that the government will fund and complete the family’s under-construction house in Araku.Later, after reaching Vijayawada in the evening, Naidu took strong objection to Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan’s statement about the threat to his life. “He should have informed the government if he really feels a threat to his life.

However, roping in (of his parents) when she has never shared any household with them and was never in a domestic relationship with them amounts to a clear abuse of the process of law,” said Justice Dangre.The court said the woman’s contention that provisions of the DV law can be invoked even if there is no domestic relationship was “totally misconceived”. The court said the DV law could not have been applied to the parents and struck down proceedings issued against them by the magistrate.The woman said she had filed the DV case against her in-laws as they had never accepted her and had instigated her husband to file for divorce.The court pointed to the definition of the term “aggrieved person” which “covers any women who is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with the accused and who alleges to have been subjected to domestic violence”.The judge further cited the definition of “domestic relationship” under the DV Act which “covers a relationship between two persons who live or have, at any point in time, lived together in a shared household, when they are related by blood, marriage, or through a relationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living together as a joint family.”The couple’s son and wife got married in 2004 and have two children. According to the parents, they did not approve of the inter-caste and inter-state marriage and had not maintained any relationship with their son’s family. The son and his family lived separately in Kharghar and they were not on visiting terms. The relationship between the son and his wife broke down and he filed for divorce. Last year, the woman filed the DV case in a Panvel court against her husband and in-laws seeking maintenance, residence and compensation.The parents claimed that they were unnecessarily dragged into the case on the basis of frivolous allegations."

Otherwise there could be long-standing negative consequences.”Following Loni’s death, protest strikes were observed in Quetta, Balochistan’s capital, and other Pashtun majority area of the volatile province. The PTM claimed that the state was involved in the alleged killing of Loni. Two days ago, at least 18 PTM activists were arrested during a protest outside the Islamabad Press Club.The PTM was formed last year by Pashtun youth from tribal regions after the extra-judicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, a young Pashtun model from Waziristan, in a fake police encounter in Karachi. Ignored completely by the local media and mainstream political parties, for their strong views against the security establishment, the PTM had staged massive protests and rallies in different parts of the country against enforced disappearances, extrajudicial arrests and killings, as well as the mistreatment of the Pashtun community by security forces. “Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai, Iss ke peechay wardi hai” (the uniform is to be blamed for terrorism) is the movement’s main slogan.On Thursday, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi reacted sharply to the Afghan President’s comment and called it as “irresponsible” and a “gross interference” in the internal affairs of the country.“We reject the tweet by President Ashraf Ghani. Such irresponsible statements are only gross interference. Afghan leadership needs to focus on long-standing serious grievances of the Afghan people,” Qureshi posted onTwitter."

The ties further nose-dived in 2017 with no bilateral talks taking place between them.India has been maintaining that terror and talks cannot go together.India remains a popular destination for medical tourists from Pakistan while thousands of members of divided families visit each other.

This number is woefully inadequate compared to other states. “While there are other factors that deal with the occurrence of domestic violence, we can also see that there is much better of such crimes in states which have higher number of protection officers consequently addressing the issue and enabling better relief,” she said.Failure on the part of the state to ensure effective implementation of the Act would tantamount to failure to ensure smooth execution of justice delivery system. The Act is a social welfare legislation and the state should endeavour to ensure complete and effective implementation, she added.She further contended that inordinate delay caused in the process of obtaining justice from the magistrate concerned is a function of overburdening of magistrates coupled with inability of protection officers who are only one to each district to prepare the detailed investigation report (DIR)."

Reason: a senior student asked a junior to button his shirt.The ego-bloated junior (a day scholar) formed a group among his friends and waited for his return to avenge against the senior (backed by hostlers of the college).“If only that incident is to be considered, it would look like a small clash between hostlers and day scholars. But, a cold war like situation existed for months together between the students ever since late 2016 after a professor was transferred following a harassment complaint,” said a student involved in the clash on condition of anonymity.Despite being transferred, the professor was in constant touch with students of his caste staying in the hostel and he had been instructing them from behind. It became evident when one of those students broke an arm of a fellow student who escalated the harassment, the student said. The arm-breaking incident was never reported.“It is not the only incident which is underplayed or hushed up within the campus. Over 90% of cases are hushed up and dealt within the campus of both government and private colleges. A police complaint is registered only when someone is murdered, or multiple students sustain grievous injuries,” said a judicial source.Almost all the colleges have a disciplinary committee and the students involved in clashes would be produced before the committee.Depending upon the issue, the committee would suspend the students for days together, said a professor from a reputed college. He said the students belonging to different communities, states, age and ideology engage in clashes.Former SFI secretary Deepak Chandrakanth say, “When some professors provoke students to fight against each other, how would they allow it to be reported.” Most of the clashes that take place in the colleges are communal.While government colleges hide such issues to save their face, private colleges hide them to safeguard their reputations, he said. The students involved in clashes are also supported by outsiders to a larger extend.“But, communal clashes are not witnessed inside the campus in recent times. Moreover, student clashes are very rarely reported inside the college premises,” said C Pichandi, former general secretary of Association of University Teachers, hinting that the clashes continue to take place outside the premises.“Everyone wants to appear as a hero in front of their fellow students and wants someone to be afraid of them. To establish themselves as powerful persons, they fight against those who differ in opinion. The difference in opinion were pinpointed and enhanced by outsiders, without whom clashes to a larger extend could be prevented,” said T Veeramani, state president of the Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association (TNGCTA)In most of the clashes, vulnerable members of the gang would face punishment and the key players would escape and the only way to prevent such clashes is to educate the students about equality. The real education comes only through exposure and experience, said D Jeevalakshmi, a former student of Government Law College, adding that professors should, first, be educated to teach students about equality."

The conspiracy is deep-rooted and has extremely serious repercussions. Considering the nature and magnitude of the conspiracy, the investigating agency is required to be given sufficient opportunity to unearth the evidence against the accused,"" the bench said.Expressing its satisfaction with the probe agency, the bench said that Pune Police had sufficient material against Teltumbde and that allegations against him were not ""baseless"".TheHCfurther noted that initially the probe by the police was limited to the violence that had erupted on January 1 this year, a day after the Elgar Parishad event was held at historic Shaniwarwada in Pune.""However, now the scope of the investigation is not restricted to the Koregaon-Bhima incident, but the activities leading to the incident and subsequent activities as well are the subject matter of the investigation,"" the bench said.Therefore, Teltumbde's connection with the banned organisation, Communist Party of India (Maoist), will have to be probed into, it said.""In the present case, the allegations and material against the petitioner (Teltumbde) travel beyond mere allegations of him being a member of the banned organisation. His participation and active role is spelt out in the material collected by the police,"" the judges said.While opposing Teltumbde's plea, Additional Public Prosecutor Aruna Kamat-Pai had submitted to the HC five letters allegedly written by the accused to each other in which Teltumbde's name was mentioned as an active participant.Teltumbde's counsel Mihir Desai claimed that the letters cannot be relied upon to prove his complicity, as they name a person 'Anand' or 'Com. Anand' and hence it cannot be conclusively said that the person referred to in the letters is in fact the petitioner.However, the bench said it was satisfied that the police has the material to establish the identity of Teltumbde as 'Anand' or 'Com. Anand', as referred to in the documents and letters submitted, which also form part of the chargesheet.Pune Police had last month filed a chargesheet in a local court against ten activists and absconding Maoist leaders in theElgar Parishad case.It named ten accused including activists Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut and Sudhir Dhavale, who were arrested in June.Other five accused named in the charge sheet are Maoist leaders Dipak alias Milind Teltumbade, Kishan Da alias Prashant Bose and Prakash alias Rituparn Goswami.The police had alleged that inflammatory speeches and provocative statements made by several activists during the Elgar Parishad conclave had contributed to the violence that broke out around Koregaon Bhima village the next day, January 1.January 1, 2018 marked the bicentennial celebration of the 1818 battle of Koregaon Bhima.Several activists were named in the FIR lodged on January 8.Eight more activists, including Teltumbde, were named in another FIR filed in October.Some of the activists-- Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj, P Varavara Rao and Gautam Navlakha-- have already been arrested by the police.According to police, the Elgar Parishad event was funded and supported by Maoists."

It was early 2017, and I was very happy with the work I was doing with an NGO as part of a larger UN project in the state. A little over a month into the job, I was told that the UN agency was happy with my work and the head of the agency was visiting Patna for a review. Little did I know that it would turn out to be the worst moment of my life.I felt uncomfortable in the very first meeting with the UN official on March 27. His looks and his body language were offending to say the least. He also touched me inappropriately during a group photo session.Two days later, on the sidelines of an official engagement, the official said I was beautiful and if I followed what he said and made him happy, I would get a job in the UN agency. I rejected his advances and told him that I would grow in my profession based on my own talent.‘I speak so that others won’t suffer alone’In the first of this series, a successful career woman in her early 40s explains that her confident facade hides scars of being harassed by an uncle, victimised by an alcoholic husband and raped by a stranger. She tried to numb the pain with alcohol and drugs, but then chose to fight back. Now sober for nearly eight years, she says she still struggles for a life that’s ‘normal’.But the harassment did not stop. He touched me inappropriately in the elevator later that day. He left Bihar the next day and I decided to put the incident behind me, ignoring it as a bad dream.I enjoyed my work on women empowerment and thought working harder would help me forget the attack on my dignity. I was wrong. The incidents kept playing in my mind and I decided to resign in July. However, the NGO I worked with convinced me to stay on.Later that year, I was asked to depose before a mission that came to review the working of the UN agency. I was asked by the mission if I had ever been offered a contract to work with the UN. I told the mission about the offer the top UN official had made me in March. I also told the mission how out of place it was to offer me a contract because I had then worked for only a month on the project. I also spoke of other flaws I had noticed in the system.‘Being abused as a child affected all my relationships’It has taken a 28-year-old lawyer from Delhi over a decade to speak out about being abused as a child. And he is yet to muster the courage to confide in his parents or wife.Things changed after my deposition. I learnt that the official I had faced harassment from tried to stall some of the work I was doing under the project citing legal issues. However, we carried on and in December, the project was completed successfully.In January this year, the same UN official sought to give me a contract for a job. At first, I was confused at the sudden change in his stance. I finally chose to break my silence in February and wrote a mail to the him expressing my anguish and distress at the behaviour meted out to me.READ ALSO: ‘I called him bhaiya, yet he raped me over and over again’I then reached out to the ministry of external affairs and also filed a police complaint. I accused the senior official and two women staffers of “verbal abuse and character assassination”. The ministry of external affairs asked the UN agency to submit a response to my allegations of harassment.The UN agency then set up an internal investigation and I appeared before the inquiry committee. But I am not hopeful of getting justice from this internal body. I want him tried under the sexual harassment law and Internal Complaints Committee mechanism available to other women working in the Indian government and private sector. I want to seek justice under the criminal justice system.READ ALSO: Why they stayed silentUnfortunately, the three employees against whom I have made a complaint are covered by the “immunity clause” applicable to UN officials which protects them from being tried under the law of the country they work for. I have appealed to the MEA for waiver of immunity so the man can be tried as per the Indian law. I ask why in my own country can I not exercise my constitutional right to seek justice through a free and fair trial?Based on the complainant’s account and FIRREAD ALSO: ‘We have normalised abuse by telling girls to ignore it’THE UN AGENCY'S RESPONSE TO TOIIn response to queries from TOI, the UN issued a statement saying that the international body was cooperating with the Bihar police investigation. “The United Nations does not comment on an ongoing investigation and we ask that all parties respect the judicial and investigative process. The investigation is carried out both by the Bihar Police and independently by the [UN agency’s] office of investigations. The latter is now over and the conclusions and findings are awaited soon,” it said. “The UN has a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment in the workplace, even more so now after several high-profile cases have been made public across several UN organisations,” it added.Read other first person accounts from the serieshereBreaking the silence: Speak up against sexual violence24:27"

BJP spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik said that it was the Congress workers who began by flinging chappals, samosas and waterbottles at the BJP workers. He said police should investigate how Congress workers could assemble in such large numbers without prior permission from the authorities to protest or demonstrate.“Our protest was a peaceful one to make people aware of how the Congress was misguiding people about the Rafale aircraft deal,” Naik said. “We had all the necessary permissions for the rally. Our MP, Vinay Tendulkar, was scheduled to speak about how a clean chit was given in the Rafale case by the Supreme Court. The Congress leaders’ intention was to stop him from talking because their lies on the Rafale case would be exposed.”On Friday, the BJP had organised a rally at its party headquarters in Panaji to protest the “Congress’ attempts to misguide the country over the contract to procure 18 Dassault Rafale aircraft for the Indian Air Force (IAF)”. Expecting nearly 200 BJP karyakartas, a handful of Congress workers kept a plate of samosas and a bouquet of flowers to “welcome” them. This irked the BJP karyakartas, and then the jostling between workers from both parties began.BJP’s Kiran Kandolkar alleged that Coutinho also made derogatory gestures. “She climbed atop a car, flung chapals, and made shameful gestures at our leaders and workers,” he said. “One of our workers, Ankit Mahatme, got his eye hurt as the chapal hit him, and he required treatment. We need not prove anything, the facts can be seen in the photographs clicked by journalists themselves.”Naik said that it was the Congress workers’ intention to incite the BJP workers from the start. “They claim they have not done anything and they were in fact waiting to welcome us,” he said. “They were standing with one plate of samosas in a derogatory manner for hundreds of BJP workers who participated in the protest. They call this Gandhigiri. I think it is not Gandhigiri of Mahatma Gandhi. I think they are referring to Rahul Gandhigiri,” said Naik.Both parties later filed police complaints following Friday’s clash."

Bhim rap to Dalit pop: How the music of protest is thriving,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/bhim-rap-to-dalit-pop/articleshow/67211247.cms,"YouTube,Religious violence in Odisha,Koraput district,jalandhar,heavy metal music,Ethnomusicology","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-67211413,imgsize-762494,width-400,resizemode-4/67211413.jpg","“I am the Eklavya of these times, my archery is hip-hop, the words erupting in my mind are turning into arrows,” raps Sumeet Samos in Odia. He goes on: “This time, the fingers won’t be cut, these arrows will instead pierce this very society, disturb its stability”. Samos, a Delhi-based Dalit rapper, brings up issues rarely heard in the mainstream music industry — from a song about the Kandhamal riots of 2008, to a critique of the limited vocabulary around reservations: “All you know is five words: Dalit, merit, caste, Ambedkar, reservation,” goes the catchy chorus.Samos, who raps in English, Hindi and Odia, feels the mainstream music industry thinks of Dalit artists only as folk artists. “I wanted to show them that we’re more than that,” says the 26-year-old, who is one of many young musicians taking on caste in genres like extreme heavy metal and pop.(Sumeet Samos, 26-yr-old Dalit rapper. One of his well-known numbers, Ladai Seekh Le, encourages Dalit youths to keep fighting against casteism)Ginni Mahi, 20, describes her music as part pop, part hip-hop, and part devotional hymns. TheJalandhargirl shot into the spotlight three years ago after her hits Fan Baba Sahib Di, Danger and Danger 2 racked up millions of views onYouTube. Mahi was hailed as belonging to the sub-genre of ‘chamar pop’, because of the lyrics that turn a slur into a badge of pride. “People use the word ‘chamar’ in a derogatory and discriminatory way. I want to sing about equality and breaking down barriers as much as possible,” says Mahi, who regularly performs at live shows.Meanwhile, The Casteless Collective takes ‘gaana’, an indigenous genre popular among the working class of north Madras, and makes it world music. Comprising 19 members, the collective was the brainchild of filmmaker Pa. Ranjith. The group includes diverse music-makers, from ‘gaana’ artists to rappers from Mumbai’s Dharavi slum. The group sees itself as a “political awareness outfit,” taking on matters of Dalit identity, issues like beef-eating, manual scavenging and the idea of a modern-day Ambedkar, and also LGBT rights and feminism. “If you see a video about manual scavenging, it might not affect you. But, if a manual scavenger is the one singing a song about his life to you, that’s powerful,” says Tenma, 30, who leads the band.Ginni Mahi. 20-yr-old pop singer. Her hits Fan Baba Sahib Di, Danger, Danger 2 have more than 4m viewsSamos sees his music as an extension of his activism. “In 2016, Rohith Vemula committed suicide and I was involved in the student protest. It pushed me to do something.” That’s where rap came in.“Growing up in Odisha’sKoraput district, I experienced direct kinds of discrimination. There were segregated colonies, your school and access to water were determined by your caste identity,” he says. At JNU, however, he began to see more indirect forms of discrimination such as being denied opportunities at seminars despite being the course topper and feeling patronised by professors “like they’re giving us charity”.Music is a very effective means of liberation and protest because “it works more subtly to transmit messages,” says Dr Zoe Sherinian, professor ofEthnomusicologyand author of Tamil Folk Music as Dalit Liberation. Genres like rock and rap, she says, are good urban equivalents to the traditional folk forms that Dalit liberation has used. “Rap music especially can be performed with just vocals accompanied by beats. If the music remains technically accessible and participatory, young Dalit musicians can use these genres, as well as contemporary folk styles like gaana in Tamil Nadu, to unify young people in their struggles against caste, class, and gender oppression”.The name of Kerala-based death metal band Willuwandi translates to ‘bullock cart’, a reference to the solo revolt by activist Mahatma Ayyankali in Kerala in 1893, when he drove a bullock cart through a public road, wearing a turban, at a time when the oppressed castes were not allowed to be seen in public places. The band hopes to “to wake up Dalits and backward castes” with its music, says its frontman, Sethu Willuwandi. “We want to motivate people. Inspiration only changes thoughts, but motivation changes actions,” he says.Samos feels inspired by the sense of community that has come from his music. “When I started doing this, young Dalit people from all over the country started messaging me, telling me how they related to my music.”Mahi, too, has received immense support from the Dalit community, but she wants the socially dominant to pay attention too. “I sing for everyone — so we can end the caste system and break barriers. It isn’t enough for just my community to hear my message of equality,” she says."

But between April 2015 and December 2017, about 430 new bank branches and 1,045 ATMs were opened in 35 districts most affected by Maoist violence, Modi said.When asked whether the area under Left Wing Extremism (LWE) had really shrunk, the prime minister said 44 of 126 districts have been removed from the list of Maoists affected areas.""No area likes being called an LWE-affected area. It adversely impacts the psyche of the local population. Based on the changed ground realities, 44 out of 126 districts have been removed from the list of LWE-affected areas. These are those districts that did not see any violence for the last four years,"" Modi said.Due to the government's policies, the push for development and zero tolerance for any violence, about 3,380 Maoists surrendered from 2014 to 2017. From 2010 to 2013, the number was around 1,380, he said.""What can solve people's problems is not violence but development. And that is why, our approach (while having no tolerance for any sort of violence and disturbance) is to devote unparalleled resources towards the development of areas prone to violence,"" the prime minister said.The security situation in the North East had also improved tremendously, he said.""In 2017, we had the lowest insurgency-related incidents and casualties among civilians and security forces in the last 20 years! Tripura and Mizoram are virtually free from insurgency,"" Modi said.In Meghalaya, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act was removed from all areas from March 31, 2018 and it remains in only eight police stations in Arunachal Pradesh, the prime minister said.""We are leaving no stone unturned to protect our sisters and brothers of the North East. Police infrastructure is being strengthened across the region. Wherever needed, additional India Reserve Battalions are being raised.""Modi said his government wants to bring back ""misguided youngsters"" to the mainstream.""It is extremely anguishing when misguided youngsters are drawn to violence. We want to bring these youngsters back to the mainstream, so that they can contribute to the development of India. In the North East, there is the surrender-cum-rehabilitation policy. We revised the policy in April 2018 so that more youngsters who turned to militancy come back to the mainstream,"" he said.According to the prime minister, north eastern states like Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura are also on broad-gauge map of the country.""A few weeks ago, the first commercial flight in three decades reached Arunachal Pradesh. The road network is being expanded and waterways are being harnessed.An improved security situation combined with a push for development is convincing people about the perils of violence and instability. It is also fulfilling the aspirations of the youth of the state,"" Modi stated."

After the family refused to cremate Sumit, she said, the administration had promised to increase the financial help to match that which was given to the family of the slain cop Subodh Kumar Singh. “They also promised a government job for my brother and pension for my parents. After making these false promises, the administration made us cremate Sumit. Since then we have not been given a hearing,” she said.The family expressed disappointment after meeting the CM, saying that he would take any kind of action only when the magisterial probe into the incident was over but Sumit’s father Amarjeet Singh said that they were confident that the government would fulfil its promises. “The CM said that a magisterial probe is being carried out. After the investigation, two accused constables will be punished. No innocent will be framed. Even on the compensation he said that a decision will be taken after the magisterial probe is over,” Babli said. The 21-year-old Sumit was among the two people who were killed in Bulandshahr’s Syana village after allegations of cow slaughter sparked off mob violence. Sumit was, in fact, named in the FIR filed in the killing of police officer Subodh Kumar Singh, the other person who lost his life in the violence. However, the government later announced financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh for his family. Amarjeet Singh said that a video that was circulating, purportedly showing Sumit as part of the mob that attacked Subodh Kumar Singh, was not of his son. “That was not my son in the video. He was at home when the violence broke out and when he went to drop a friend to the bus stop, he got caught in the violence and was shot,” he said."

When some unidentified persons set bikes of the rallyists on fire, clashes erupted among the groups, and 17 people were detained.In North 24-Parganas, a police outpost in Jagaddal was ransacked, leaving several injured.

As his family and colleagues remembered the police officer killed by a rioting mob inBulandshahr, the image that emerges is of a man devoted to his duty and those he loved, a natural leader trusted and admired by those who knew him.Days after Subodh’s murder by a mob following an incident of allegedcattle slaughterin Bulandshahr, conversations TOI had with his colleagues, senior officers, family and friends revealed a man who led from the front, was serious about a police officer’s role in society and lived by secular tenets he tried hard to instill in his two young sons.Subodh Kumar Singh with his familyThe officer’s fellow cops remember him as a man for whom duty came first. “If I had to pick four policemen for any special assignment, he was always my first choice. He had all the leadership qualities and was very efficient in dealing with the public. Also, he was up to handling the toughest of situations,” said Swapnil Mangain, commandant at 41st battalion, Provincial Armed Constabulary, Meerut, who was SSP in Mathura when Singh was posted there.“I worked with Subodh at Vrindavan for eight months. I don’t know about the people of Bulandshahr, but I know people in Mathura cried when they heard about his murder,” said senior sub-inspector Avdhesh Kumar, station in-charge of Jait police station.Police officials pay tribute to Subodh Kumar SinghSubodh was the investigating officer in the Akhlaq lynching case in Dadri from September 28 to November 9, 2015. “He played an important role in the way the volatile situation was handled, and the investigation afterwards. The main accused were arrested quickly. He and I chaired peace committees in the days that followed. We managed to keep control of the situation,” said Anurag Singh, then circle officer of Dadri, now posted with ATS in Lucknow.But if Subodh was admired by fellow cops, his “uprightness” also riled some. “He had the aura of an upright man in khaki which you seldom see. Politicians did not like that,” said Praveen Ranjan Singh, Bulandshahr superintendent of police (city).“He would rarely toe the line when it came to political pressure. He was under immense pressure during the Akhlaq lynching probe to act in a certain way. He would listen to everyone but act on his conscience,"" said another cop, once his senior during the Noida posting.Subodh Kumar SinghLovingly known as ‘Thakur’ among friends and family, Subodh Kumar Singh also had a sense of humour, cracking jokes in tense situations during police operations. Fond of food, cinema and biking, he had a larger-than-life aura.Atul Kumar Singh, ex-soldier of Indian Army and elder brother of Subodh, said, “Right from childhood, he was a fearless person and accepted every challenge thrown at him. In the past, he had taken three bullets in police operations, but he never worried.”Subodh joined the police force in 1998 after his father sub-inspector Rampratap Rathore’s death. At that time, he was pursing his BA in Jawaharlal Nehru Degree College, Etah. He met his future wife Rajani there.“I loved that man for his bravery,” Rajani told TOI. “In his entire career he faced lots of threats from the mafia, gangsters and even politicians, but he never backed down. He was shot in the neck during a special operation group posting in Meerut. On several occasions, I asked him to quit the job, but he was passionate about his profession.”Shrey, eldest son of Subodh, said his father has left him with precious lessons. “Treat everyone equally. Be fair. That’s what he told us.” It’s something bother Abhishek also carries in his heart. “By nature he was secular and the religious identity of any criminal never mattered to him. He wanted me to be a lawyer. He was my role model.”"

However, in a wide range of contexts they are willing to endorse violence.The findings revealed that the most common conditions that enable long periods of mutually escalating xenophobic tension occur when social hazards, such as outgroup members who deny the group’s core beliefs, overwhelm people to the point that they can no longer deal with them.

Two other police officers transferred on Saturday are Syana circle officer Satyaprakash Sharma, who has been sent to Moradabad and Chingrawati outpost in charge Suresh Kumar Singh, now shifted to Lalitpur. Chingrawati police outpost in Syana tehsil of the district was the epicentre of Monday violence in which station house officer Subodh Kumar Singh was killed.According to police sources based in Lucknow, the decision to transfer these officers was taken by the chief minister's office on the basis of the SIT report submitted by ADG (Intelligence) SB Shiradkar which had reportedly blamed the local police for its failure to act on intelligence inputs and also their inability to defuse the build-up in four hours -- between 9.30 am, when the police got information about the trouble, and 1.30 pm when the police inspector and a youth were killed.“Sitapur SP Prabhakar Chaudhary has been made new SSP of Bulandshahr and he will take over soon,” said principal secretary, home, Arvind Kumar, on Saturday. Soon after the SSP Singh’s transfer, local BJP workers and other saffron groups broke into celebration and even garlanded Syana MLA Devendra Singh Lodhi for his success in 'getting these officers sifted'.TOI reported on December 7 that BJP leaders of Syana had written to Bulandshahr MP Bhola Singh in September this year, seeking transfer of SHO Subodh Singh and other local police officers, accusing them of harassing people and creating obstacles in the way of Hindus' religious functions.“After the cop was killed, police crossed all limits while conducting searches in nearby villages. They didn't spare even women and old people. Many women are still hospitalised. He (the SSP) should have been terminated,"" Lodhi told TOI.Meanwhile, the SIT report on the Monday violence is learnt to have confirmed that inspector Subodh Kumar Singh and Sumit were killed with pistol of the same bore – .32 -- and a forensic test report has been sought to confirm this.The report zeroed in on some police officers for their failure in acting on time to defuse the tension and save two lives. It also prima facie ruled out that the inspector was on the target of Hindu organisations for his investigation in the Akhlaq lynching case.ADG (Intelligence) submitted his report to principal secretary (home), who discussed it with CM Yogi Adityanath after he returned from Delhi on Friday evening.

If Sumit is found guilty, there should be action accordingly, if not, then what is the problem with the compensation?"" Som said.""Did you raise a question when Akhlaq was given compensation by the government despite 'govansh' (part of cow) being found in his house ... you must remember that,"" he claimed.""If anyone is found with stones (guilty), action would be taken against them,"" the BJP MLA added.In Chingrawathi village, Sumit's family had initially refused to conduct his last rites until the government assured Rs 50 lakh compensation, pension to his parents and a police job to his elder brother.They agreed to cremate the body only after the district administration announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the family and were assured by the local MP and MLA of pursuing their demand for compensation with the state government.On Bajrang Dal and BJP workers being named in the FIR for violence and rioting in the case, Som said regardless of political affiliations, caste or religion, the guilty would be punished.""The chief minister has directed the administration for strict action against the guilty,"" he said.""So much effort is being made to stop cow slaughtering, yet some people indulge in it to vitiate the atmosphere. Be assured that strict action would be taken against them,"" the BJP leader warned.Asked whether the government failed to curb the incidents of cow slaughtering, Som shot back and said it will be the state's failure when no strict action will be taken against the guilty.Som also defended the Uttar Pradesh Police and lauded it for the ""hard work"", saying some of the accused have been arrested while those absconding would be nabbed soon.Asked about some ""dispute"" over the names mentioned in the FIR on cow slaughter charges, the BJP MLA said when thousands of people are involved and a case is registered, there are ""chances of error"".""It would only be a mistake if these names get charge sheeted. The wrong names will be dropped,"" he said, claiming that the incident was a ""huge conspiracy and it will be proved when the probe findings are out""."

There could have been the fear that police could turn aggressive after a colleague’s death,” said a senior police officer. “In a way, even whileinspectorSubodh died in the line of duty, his death eventually averted what could have been a much bigger tragedy,” he added.The site from where the cow carcasses were recovered on Monday morning — Mahav village — seems to have been meticulously chosen, raising doubts in the mind of investigators about the possibilities of a bigger conspiracy.The village is barely 500 metres away from the local police outpost under Syana police circle which is a communally sensitive region and was under a month-long curfew following a major communal riots that broke out in Khurja town of the district in early 1990s.Moreover, Mahav’s adjoining villages Chingrawti and Baans Kala are reportedly dominated by a particular community. Not only this, the road on which the police outpost is situated was to be used by thousands of people returning from a religious congregation at Dariyapur on their way to Rampur, Bareilly, Moradabad and Lucknow. The road leads to Delhi-Moradabad highway.After violence broke out, police were quick to set up holding areas on the route and divert traffic from the congregation which was attended by lakhs.The state government has also acknowledged that the violence was ‘part of a larger conspiracy’ and in a late night review meeting held on Tuesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed Director General of Police (DGP) O P Singh to trace the conspirators and perpetrators and take stringent action against them.“How did the carcasses reach the site from where they were recovered and who was behind this is also a major focus of the probe,” the DGP said on Wednesday.The investigators were also puzzled by the fact that why would anyone slaughter cows in an open field unless mischief was the motive. Sources, however, said that slaughter of cows was nothing new in the region. Recently, a major protest against cow slaughter was held outside same police outpost which was attacked by mob during Monday’s violence.“The site is also important because of its proximity to the national capital. In case a full-fledged riot had taken place, the violence would have caught the attention of national and international media,” said a senior police officer."

Singh was the investigating officer in the case but was later removed before the charge sheet was filed.“Singh was killed in a very well-planned conspiracy, as he was hated by communal forces after the Akhlaq case probe. In Syana he was accused of sympathising with cow smugglers by right-wing activists. The entire violence clearly seems to be planned. It’s very strange that someone involved in cow slaughter would put the carcass out for display knowing the sensitive situation in the state. When was the last time anyone heard about the head and skin of cows hung in a field for display?” asked Hayat.“Singh was a bold policeman who never backed down from any tough situation, even during the Akhlaq investigation case. He knew the challenges in the sensitive region of West UP, but I believe he too didn’t expect such a conspiracy to kill him. He ventured into the crowd alone to pacify them but was lynched and shot dead.

Always challenging herself, and finding perfection in her imperfections, and who — despite all the success, fame and recognition attached to her name — still prefers calling herself a ‘middle-class Indian girl’ over a ‘star’. In an unguarded exchange with Pune Times on her recent visit to the city to introduce her badminton team Pune7Aces , Taapsee spoke about what makes her such a fierce, honest and no-nonsense actor. Excerpts...With each performance of yours, you have evolved as an actor, despite having never received any formal training in acting or having any kind of a filmi background...That’s correct! I think it is because I am aware of the fact that I don’t know the nuances of acting, and I do not pretend to know the job or the craft well. I have always been open to learning. I’ve learned it all on the job. Another fact is that I don’t have the fear of losing anything. You see, I started from ground zero and I’ve already seen the lowest point. So, there’s no pressure at the back of my mind to protect a name or to wonder, ‘will I able to get up if I take a fall?’. I can’t live life with these thoughts. And that fearlessness makes me the kind of personality that I am. It reflects in my job as well, because I am 100 per cent there on the sets. I get into each character that I am playing. I argue with my filmmakers if I need to, and if I don’t know something, I always ask. So, it works for me, as a person and as an actor.In an industry where there’s constant pressure to be and look a certain way, and to curate each post on social media to make it look like your life is picture perfect, how difficult is it to be yourself?Honestly, I feel that I live each and every moment of my life. People try to pass every day thinking ki ‘chalo, ye abhi aisa kar lete hain, toh future accha ho jayega’. There’s no point of thinking, ‘let’s hustle right now or stress now, to ensure tomorrow will be better’. No, I don’t believe in that funda. I feel that we need to live each and every day, only then is our life worth living. Otherwise, you are dragging yourself and trying to survive. So, I live my life. And that’s why I come across as a person who is outspoken, bindaas and no-nonsense. I tell people this all the time. Is it really too much to be yourself? Is it, like, a big thing that I’m being myself in the industry? I don’t think it is... It takes big courage to realise that at first but when you do, it is some other feeling. You feel on top of the world, because you are not going to be standing there and doing things to validate yourself to other people, and doing things because others like it. It is because you like it. When you do things that you like, people will automatically like you. The same goes for social media as well. I don’t post pictures to get approval from others. I share a lot of real pictures of mine, which are far from perfect and isn’t that imperfection what makes us human? That makes us real and relatable?Is being real, relatable and true to yourself what you strive for in your work as well? For example, what compelled you to do a movie like Mulk?I grew up in a family where I was always taught to stand for what is right. There’s a line in Mulk – ‘Jo sahi hai woh toh kahenge’. As an Indian, I have a certain sense of responsibility and I owe that to my nation, in a way. I mean, if I am right I have nothing to fear. What will happen to me? I started from ground zero, so what more can you do to me? Coming to Mulk, which has received critical acclaim and love. It was running houseful till the sixth week, and the kind of messages I keep receiving on social media even today is humbling. It feels great to see that there are people who feel the same way you do. I’ll be very honest; when I chose Mulk there was no one standing beside me. Even my own team was doubtful about it, and asked me questions like, ‘Do you really need to do this film?’, ‘It’s not that you have not proven yourself to be a good actor, or that you will not get other opportunities to prove yourself’, ‘I don’t think you will get a release for this film’, or ‘How will people react to it?’ To all these questions, I just replied, ‘people might not react to Mulk positively, and that’s the nerve we want to touch’. But at the end of the day, I am really happy with the kind of response, love, and even trolling, that Mulk has received. I cannot keep silent on the things that matter to us.Yet, a lot of celebrities feel comfortable maintaining silence on the #MeToo India Movement or LGBTQ rights or other pressing issues. Is it because they fear backlash?Precisely. Even before the #MeToo Movement started in India, I was asked – ‘would you like to talk about it?’ Some said that ‘outsiders’ in the industry go through sexual harassment in Bollywood, and I’m sure that is the case, sincewomenhave come out and named their perpetrators. However, fortunately, it hasn’t happened to me. Had it happened to me, this movement would be the perfect opportunity to speak out and name and shame the perpetrators. However, that doesn’t mean that I won’t stand by the bravehearts who have experienced sexual harassment. I am part of the CINTAA committee that ensures justice is served. I mean, not just the film fraternity, women in all spheres have gone through some or the other type of harassment in their daily lives. I didn’t go through that in the industry, but in normal life, when I travel by public transport, I experience the ‘gaze’. I mean, I feel the pervert gaze in public places all the time, till date, and that, in itself, is so heart-wrenching. My mom and dad still call me after 8 pm to check whether I’ve reached home safely or not. If I am in Delhi, I still have an early deadline. They are concerned, as any parents would be for their daughter, considering the world that we are living in. Thanks to the #MeToo Movement, at least some clean-up has happened in the industry, and I completely support it. It will take some time for women to be safer, but this is a great start. I am a feminist and unabashedly proud of it. I think feminism is all about equality and nothing else."

The play, which is the latest production of thetheatresociety of the university, Ansh, depicts the story of a young rape victim who is denied justice by society.
The 15-minute play questions the attitude and insensitivity of the society and administration towards rape survivors. Shourya Vir Singh, a third-year BTech student who directed the play, said, “We selected this story because we wanted to show that violence againstwomenis a cultural problem. We have performed several plays in different colleges and festivals which had comic plots. This time, we wanted to do a play that addresses a serious issue. Through this play, we are putting across a few questions to the audience – in instances like these, whose fault is it?, why is justice denied to a girl?, among others. That is why we have titled our play 'Kyun'.”The play goes on to show that while there is a growing awareness when it comes to reporting cases of sexual violence, nothing can really change until the administration is sensitive while handling these cases. The plot revolves around a college student who is raped by her classmate and it shows how everyone, from her family to the authorities, fail her.Shourya Vir Singh (right), who also directed the act, in one of the scenes of the playVibhuti Yadav, a second-year Mass Communication student of Bennett University, the lead actress of the play, said, “We wanted to show that there is a tendency to shame the victim in our society and it starts at home. It took us around seven to ten days to prepare for the play because it was important to get every aspect right.”Mohit Verma, a school teacher who was among the audience, shared with us, “I was quite impressed with the efforts of the students because they attempted to address such a serious issue in a 15-minute play.

UP Police confirmed that they have seized two video clips from which they were trying to ascertain if Raj instigated his men and open fire at police.Though police have not named any organization in the FIR, Bajrang Dal’s convenor of Meerut prant, which comprises 24 districts of western UP, Balraj Dungar said, “Yogesh Raj is district convenor ofBajrang Dalin Bulandshahr. Instead of showing gratitude towards him as he tried to help police break the blockade set up by the villagers after the discovery of cow slaughter, they framed him in the case and made him the main accused. Police are just trying to defame Bajrang Dal and hide its own shortcomings in handling the crowd.”According to the FIR, Raj claimed to have seen six people slaughtering a cow in a field next to the police outpost a day before the violence. Out of four arrested, two, identified as Chaman and Devender, are Raj’s relatives.Locally known as ‘gau rakshak’ (protector of cows), Raj’s house in the Naya Baans village is hard to miss.

His house is located barely a kilometre from the police outpost which was set on fire by the rioters on Monday.According to police, Raj was a regular to local police stations with complaints of cow smuggling.His Facebook page which has a picture of him along with a picture of Lord Rama appeals to people to join Delhi’s Dharm Sansad on December 9 to build pressure on the government for the construction of Ram temple inAyodhya.Others named in the FIR include BJP youth wing member Shikhar Agrawal and VHP activist Upendra Raghav.Deepak Dulhera, district president of BJP's youth wing, said, ""Shikhar Agarwal is definitely a member of BJP's youth wing but has been wrongly framed in the killing of the policeman.

The safety of the public property and lives of its citizens is the prime duty of the state and the Commission expects effective and prompt action from the state authorities in such situations so that a strong message could be given to the violators of the law,” said NHRC in a statement.The UP police have so far arrested four people in the case while the main accused, Yogesh Raj, is still on the run.Two FIRs have been registered in the incident - one against the alleged cow slaughter and the other against the violent protest which followed.The government has also constituted an SIT to probe the incident.In the second FIR, 27 people were named and cases were registered against 50 to 60 unidentified people.
